Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-5991

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the NVJPEG library of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit.
- It is caused by an out-of-bounds read or write operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read or write. This means the software is accessing memory locations outside of the allocated buffer or memory space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code Execution: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the system.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability could be exploited to crash the affected software or make it unavailable.
- Information Disclosure: Sensitive information might be exposed due to unauthorized memory access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access (AV:L): The attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) on the system.
- No user interaction (UI:N) is required for the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of the CUDA Toolkit prior to 11.1.1.
- The affected software is the CUDA Toolkit on Windows.
- The vulnerability was reported by Weidang Peng of Qihoo 360 AIVUL Team.
- The CVSS v3.1 base score is 6.6 with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H
