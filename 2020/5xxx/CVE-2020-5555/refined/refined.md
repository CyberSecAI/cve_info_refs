Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-5555:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper input validation in Shihonkanri Plus GOOUT CGI application. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize input parameters allowing for manipulation of arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation:** The software does not properly validate input parameters, leading to the possibility of manipulating files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker can read and write data to files located within the same directory where the vulnerable application is installed. This is a more limited scope compared to CVE-2020-5554 which allowed for arbitrary file access across the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** An attacker does not need any prior privileges or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attacker does not need any user interaction to execute the attack.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Shihonkanri Plus GOOUT versions 1.5.8 and 2.2.10.
*   The vendor is unreachable, and no official fix is available. The recommended solution is to discontinue using the affected versions.
*   The vulnerability was confirmed by IPA.
* The vulnerability was discovered due to the lack of proper input validation, allowing attackers to manipulate files.
*   CVSS v3 score: 7.3 (High), CVSS v2 Score: 7.5 (High).
* While the primary vulnerability involves arbitrary file manipulation, the impact of CVE-2020-5555 is limited to files within the same directory as the application.
