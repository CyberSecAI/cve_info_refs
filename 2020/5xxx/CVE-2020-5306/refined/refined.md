Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** The provided content does not refer to the specified CVE ID (CVE-2020-5306). The identified vulnerability is related to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in Codoforum, but the provided information indicates it was not assigned a CVE. The exploit-db entry has it listed as "N/A".

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the comment replay functionality. Specifically, the `input_txt` parameter in the POST request to `/Ajax/topic/reply` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where the injected malicious script is permanently saved on the server and executed when other users interact with the affected content.
  
**Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of other users' browsers.
   - **Cookie Stealing:** This can lead to session hijacking or stealing sensitive user cookies.
   - **CSRF Bypass:** The attacker can potentially bypass CSRF protection mechanisms.
   - **Phishing Attacks:** The injected scripts could be used to redirect users to phishing pages or trick them into performing actions they did not intend.
   - **Keylogging:** Malicious JavaScript can be used to capture keystrokes and steal user input.
  - **Account takeover:** By stealing cookies and session data, attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts and perform actions on their behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - **POST Request Manipulation:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious POST request to the `/Ajax/topic/reply` endpoint with the XSS payload within the `input_txt` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the Codoforum instance to post comments and exploit the vulnerability.
   - **Web Browser:** The attacker needs a web browser or a tool capable of crafting and sending HTTP requests to the forum application.
  - **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know which parameter is vulnerable to XSS injection (i.e., `input_txt` in this case).

**Technical Details:**
   - The provided exploit demonstrates the use of the payload:  `"><svg/onload=alert(1)>`
   - This payload is injected within a POST request to `/forum/index.php?u=/Ajax/topic/reply`.
   - The exploit triggers when a user replies to the crafted comment with the payload, or when a user creates a new topic if the payload is stored in the server database.
   - Vulnerable parameter: `input_txt`.

**Additional Information**

-  The vulnerability is present in the comment reply section of Codoforum version 4.8.3, specifically when users submit replies to forum topics.
- The injected JavaScript payloads are stored within the database and are triggered when other users interact with the post containing the payload.
- The vulnerability can lead to an attacker stealing cookies from other users and potentially performing other malicious actions on their behalf.
