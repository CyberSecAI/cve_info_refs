##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Stored Cross Site Scripting in Codoforum Latest Verson v4.8.3

### **Introduction:**

| Affected Product: | CodoForum 4.8.3 |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| Vendor Contact: | admin@codologic.com |
| Vulnerability Type: | Stored XSS |
| Remote Exploitable: | Yes |

###

###

### **Vulnerability Description**

Various components of CodoForum are vulnerable to cross site scripting. With this, it is possible to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code. This can for example be used by an attacker to inject a JavaScript keylogger, bypass CSRF protection, or perform phishing attacks and able to steal other users cookies and user agent
The attacks can be exploited by getting the victim to click a link or visit an attacker controlled website, Codoforum allows xss via Post ,

This is the Critical Stored Cross site Scripting Vulnerability found in Codoforum Latest Version, where any user or attacker can able to steal other admins or user cookie by simply posting xss links in forums, each time it got triggered when someone get reply for that post,

 The user posting mechanism is critically vulnerable to Stored Cross site scripting issue. Login to the codoforum application as an user
 Click on start a new topic to post something in forum Craft XSS payloads in each input section( eg: title name, content etc) Click on Post the content, You can see that particular post is successfully saved in the server and appear in the front page. Click on the post and click reply section you can see xss triggers while click on reply tab.then after that click on start new topic, u can see, it is stored in server and each time it gets triggered user clicks on start new topic

**Reproduction Steps:**

 Install Codoforum in Localhost >> Start new topic
> section and create new post using XSS payload Give Display name and
> title name as XSS payload Click on the POST Option , it will be
> successfully posted and any user can see the post. When any admin or
> user tried to reply to the specific post XSS triggers as well as any
> other user try to create a new topic , then also it triggers because

> those xss payloads stored in Server(database)

## Hello community,

I have been a volunteer moderator here for many years, helping the Codoloic team in the forum.

### What's going on right now:

As you have noticed, the development of **Codoforum** and **also the support** in the forum have been somewhat limited, or rather, **have come to a standstill** for the time being.
This is for **private reasons**, but the **Codologic team will get back to it**, so you can certainly hope that everything will return to normal - however, **I cannot give you a time frame for this**. Everyone has **good and bad times in life, so please take this into account**.

**Here you can read more avout the topic:**

### Do NOT spam and write in ENGLISH please:

Another important topic is **spam here and language**. **Anyone who leaves spam here will have their topic deleted** in any case, and **if they violate this again, their account will be banned forever**!

So please **refrain from spamming** and **the language in the forum is only ENGLISH**.

 **Thank you very much and best regards**.

Your moderator, WebCrew ![smile](https://codologic.com:443/forum/sites/default/assets/img/smileys/cool.gif)

[Codoforum V5.0 Released](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/topic/12897/codoforum-v5-0-released)
[admin](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/user/profile/1)
posted Sep 13 '20 at 8:36 pm

After months of development and testing and your valuable feedback, we are very pleased to announce the release of new version of our forum, **Codoforum V5.0**
Our primary focus for this release has been the internal framework itself and a whole host of new features.

Here are some of the major changes:

### Highlight to Quote:

Now you can easily quote while replying to topics by simply highlighting any part of the text and clicking the quote button.

### Badges:

Now easily assign badges and make your members feel special.

[![5f5e72d2350a4](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5f5e72d2350a4)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5f5e72d2350a4 "Click to view full size image")
[![5f5e72e655976](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5f5e72e655976)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5f5e72e655976 "Click to view full size image")

You can also upload your own badges from the control panel

[![5f5e73000cbef](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5f5e73000cbef)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5f5e73000cbef "Click to view full size image")

---

### Sticky topic without permission

This is really useful when you want your categories to be private but would want the sticky topic to be visible to users who do not have permission to view the category. This can be toggled from the Global Settings in the Control Panel.

### Login as any user

Note: This feature is for admin users to help debug any issues and hence you are responsible to uphold any privacy laws that are prevalent in your country. This can be accessed from Manage users -> Edit a user, and you should see a button to login as that user.

### Replace Limonade with FastRoute Router

We have been using the Limonade framework for over 6 years now and the framework isn't being maintained and is not compatible with new version of PHP (PHP7.4 and above), Hence we switched to FastRoute, It is written by Nikita Popov, one of the current principal contributors to PHP, Apart from being fast, it is also used as a base for many other frameworks out there.

### Global search feature

We have centralized both the topics and category search into one unified interface with advanced filters and sorting options.
[![5f5e731dcfb24](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5f5e731dcfb24)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5f5e731dcfb24 "Click to view full size image")

### Other Features:

* Responsive videos for mobiles
* Backend options for infinite and hide topic messages
* Libraries moved to composer
* Added vBulletin Importer
* New plugin for Azure Active Directory support
* Faster email batching and dequeue

---

We have made a couple of performance improvements as well as fixed many bugs.

### List of changes:

* Cyrillic characters fixed
* Excerpt updated for better performance and view
* Mentions not working properly fixed
* Title split fixed
* Permission fixes and aggregator fixes
* Made save button responsive in all pages
* Added non-ssl mail support
* Fixed digest bugs
* Infinite scrolling not working fixed
* Fixed responsive theme issues
* More prominent create/reply buttons
* Password fix for PHP 7.4
* Poll edit bug fixed
* BBcode multiline not working fixed
* Added missing translations when infinite scroll in topic
* Delete post bug fixed
* Many Editor UI fixes
* Closed topic permission fix
* Image preview fix
* Template bug fixes

### Preparing for PHP 8 and Codoforum 6

Codoforum so far has maintained strict backwards compatibility, this means you could upgrade from the oldest version of Codoforum to v5 without any major issues. The plugins written for v1 would still work for v5. This ofcourse comes at a price, The price being a lot of bloat to maintain backwards compatibility and a lot of time spent in regression tests. Codoforum v5 removes a lot of bloat and is almost a major rewrite, but as we are tied to PHP 7.3, we still cannot use the new PHP features like, Typed class properties, JIT, Attributes, Null safe operator, named arguments etc which make the code a lot cleaner, faster and easier to maintain.

Hence, we have decided that going forward, the next major release would target PHP 8, Yes, we know PHP 8 isn't out yet and is a few months away but we have already started making preparations for it.

**What would this mean for you?**
Likely nothing to worry about, you will be able to upgrade from V5.x to v6 from the control panel, If your plugins and themes target v5, they will mostly work as they do. If there are issues, we will help you through the upgrade process.

Since Freichat was an offloaded service, it was very difficult to change the look and feel of FreiChat, The upcoming release of FreiChat will have a nice backend to Manage Appearance as well as Translations (The release will also include plenty of bug fixes).

Here is a screenshot of what it looks after you play around with the colors,

[Codoforum v 4.8 released](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/topic/12469/codoforum-v-4-8-released)

It is a pleasure to announce the release of the new version of codoforum v4.8

Some highlights in this release:

**Chat**
We have been working on instant messenger feature - FreiChat; for past couple of months. We have now integrated it with codoforum, so you should now be able to see that at bottom right corner of this forum.

You can enable this feature from your forum by first upgrading the FreiChat plugin then enabling it in the Settings:

[![5da7130ba2d1c](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5da7130ba2d1c)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5da7130ba2d1c "Click to view full size image")

**Docker**
We have created a docker image for codoforum with all dependencies which installs itself automatically. So now with one single command you can install any version(>v4.7) of codoforum easily on your local or development setups.

**Role colors**
It is now possible to give unique styles to every role. We have added a new option in the backend under UI Elements -> Role colors

You can simply give the desired color or put your own styles in css for a given role:

[![5da716c04ab55](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5da716c04ab55)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5da716c04ab55 "Click to view full size image")

**New settings/configuration**

You can switch between logo and site title and upload your logo for your site header.

You can now configure whether to use username or email or both for the login screen. This configuration is also applied for the admin login.

[![5da71553ace57](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5da71553ace57)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5da71553ace57 "Click to view full size image")

Codoforum had issues with cached css where icons were not loaded when you switched between http/https or www/without www. This has finally been fixed, and now it will even work for multiple domains pointing to the same forum. There are also other couple of bug fixes in this release.

As always, you can directly upgrade the forum from your backend or download and install the new version from

[https://codoforum.com](https://codoforum.com "codoforum.com ")

[Codoforum v.4.6 released - A new future for FreiChat](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/topic/12073/codoforum-v-4-6-released-a-new-future-for-freichat)

It is a great pleasure to announce a new release of our forum V.4.6

We have fixed some annoying bugs in some plugins and fixed various ui issues.

We have also added a new plugin named 'Anti Spam Rules' for protecting your forum from spam. A visit to the forum just to see spam posts every day should greatly reduce after installing this plugin in your backend.

[![5cb33c099d2ac](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5cb33c099d2ac)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5cb33c099d2ac "Click to view full size image")

The new release completely gets rids off a huge html manipulation library named simple\_html\_dom which was used by some of the plugins. After removing this, you should see some speed improvements in your page load time.

And last, but the best feature of this release is our Private Messaging component. You should see a plugin named 'FreiChat' now in Codoforum plugins. We have used the latest technologies (ReactJS, Websockets, etc) to give you the best experience with a messaging system. Now messages will be delivered in a blink of an eye.
We will be releasing a new version within next 2 weeks for adding offline notification support in FreiChat PM; so do wait for that.

Cheers!
