Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a maliciously crafted OpenSSL engine and associated command within Viscosity's OpenVPN sandbox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Malicious OpenSSL Engine:** The core issue lies in the ability to inject a malicious OpenSSL engine into the OpenVPN sandbox. This likely exploits a weakness in how Viscosity handles or validates custom OpenSSL engines.
*   **Command Injection:** The malicious engine is accompanied by a malicious command, implying a command injection vulnerability. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the context of the sandbox.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within Viscosity's OpenVPN sandbox.
*   **macOS Specific Data Leak:** On macOS, an attacker could potentially access on-disk VPN credentials (certificate and private key) from other active OpenVPN connections running within the same sandbox. This data leak does not affect Windows users.
*   **Limited Permissions:** The exploit is contained within Viscosity's sandbox which has de-elevated permissions. This limits the attacker's actions, prevents elevation to root or SYSTEM level privileges and the attacker does not gain elevated local permissions

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access Required:** The attacker needs local access to the target machine to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Maliciously Crafted OpenSSL Engine:** The attacker must have the ability to introduce a maliciously crafted OpenSSL engine. This is likely done by using an exploit specific to the application's handling of OpenSSL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the target machine.
*   **Ability to create a malicious OpenSSL engine** and execute it in the Viscosity OpenVPN sandbox.
*   **macOS Specific:** On macOS, the attacker can use this vulnerability to gain access to credentials of other active OpenVPN connections running within the same sandbox

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered "low-severity" because the exploit is contained within a sandbox with restricted permissions.
*   The vulnerability affects both macOS and Windows versions of Viscosity. However, the potential data leak (access to VPN credentials) only affects macOS environments.
*   The report mentions that the update addresses a PKCS#11 issue, which may be tangentially related to the root cause of the vulnerability, but it's not explicitly detailed
*   The vulnerability was identified and reported by Rich Mirch.
