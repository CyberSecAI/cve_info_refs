- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the NVIDIA Control Panel component that allows an attacker with local system access to corrupt a system file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A system file can be corrupted due to an unspecified vulnerability in the NVIDIA Control Panel component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service or escalation of privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local; an attacker must have local system access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires local system access and does not need any user interaction.
