Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-5258:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `deepCopy` method within the dojo library is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype Pollution: The `deepCopy` method does not properly handle the `__proto__` property, allowing an attacker to inject properties into existing JavaScript object prototypes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate object attributes to overwrite or pollute a JavaScript application's object prototype. This could potentially lead to various attacks, including:
    - Modification of default object properties
    - Unexpected behavior or crashes
    - Arbitrary code execution (depending on how the polluted prototype is used)

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a malicious payload with a `__proto__` property to the `deepCopy` method, an attacker can inject arbitrary properties into the prototype of JavaScript objects.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `deepCopy` function, specifically the source object containing the malicious payload.
- No specific user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, as it exploits the way the `deepCopy` function is implemented.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content also includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability and how to exploit it. The PoC shows how injecting a `__proto__` property within a JSON object passed to `deepCopy` can add a new property to the base object prototype.
- The vulnerability is addressed in the following patched versions of dojo: 1.16.2, 1.15.3, 1.14.6, 1.13.7, 1.12.8, and 1.11.10.
- The fix involves checking for and ignoring the `__proto__` property during the deep copy process.
