## Description

I developed the Simple Download Monitor plugin because I needed a nice way to manage my digital downloads and monitor the number of downloads of my files and documents.

This plugin is very useful for managing and tracking your digital file download counts.

You can password protect your downloadable files and documents too (visitors will require a password before downloading the file when you use this option).

You can configure downloadable files from your WordPress admin dashboard via an elegant user interface. Then allow your visitors to download the files and this plugin will monitor which files get downloaded how many times.

The plugin will log the IP addresses of the users who download your digital files and documents. It will also log the date and time of each download.

It has a very user-friendly interface for uploading, managing, monitoring and tracking file downloads.

#### Simple Download Monitor Plugin Usage

Once you have installed the plugin, go to “Downloads -> Settings” interface to configure some options

**A) Configure Download Monitor basic settings**

* Admin Options: Remove Tinymce Button – Removes the SDM Downloads button from the WP content editor (default: unchecked).
* Color Options: Download Button Color – Select a default color of the download button (default: green).

To configure a new download follow these steps:

1. Go to “Downloads->Add New” interface in your WP admin
2. Enter a title for your download
3. Add a description for the download

5. Select an image for the download (it will be displayed as a thumbnail on the front end)
6. Publish it

You can view all of your existing downloads from the “Downloads->Downloads” interface.

**C) Create a download button**

Create a new post/page and click the “SDM Downlaods” TinyMCE button to insert a shortcode (This button will only show up if you haven’t unchecked it in the settings). You can choose to display your download with a nice looking box or just a plain download link/button.

Example Shortcode Usage:

```
[sdm_download id="271" fancy="1"]  (embed a download button inside a box with other information e.g. Thumbnail, Title and Description)

[sdm_download id="271" fancy="0"]  (embed a plain download button/link for a file)

Great plugin.
Suggestions:
I started with the download url. I use it with the button block in wordpress. This gives me different possibilities in the design. Now I want visitors to agree with the terms of use. I should like to do that like it already happens in the sdm block.
I should like the possibility to exclude my own ip from the statistics. Now I have to remove it from the logs. I would like to exclude myself in the settings.
Thanks for this plugin!
