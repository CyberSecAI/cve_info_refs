Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5397:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Spring Framework (specifically Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux) handles CORS preflight requests. These requests, intended to check if a cross-origin request is permissible, could be exploited to bypass CSRF protections.
*   The vulnerability arises because preflight requests should not include credentials and therefore should fail authentication. However, Chrome-based browsers send TLS client certificates in CORS preflight requests, which violate the specification requirements and bypass the intended authentication failure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The core weakness is a bypass of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
*   **CORS Mismanagement:** Incorrect handling of CORS preflight requests in conjunction with specific browser behavior is the root cause of the bypass.
*   **Browser-Specific Issue:** The issue is exacerbated by Chrome-based browsers sending client certificates in preflight requests contrary to the specification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially perform actions on a user's behalf on non-authenticated endpoints.
*   No HTTP body can be sent or received through this attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Origin Request:** The attack relies on initiating a cross-origin request from a malicious website.
*   **CORS Preflight Request:** The attacker uses CORS preflight requests to bypass the CSRF protection.
*   **Chrome Browser:** The attack is more likely to be successful when the target user uses a Chrome-based browser with client certificates enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to host a malicious website.
*   The victim needs to use a vulnerable Spring application and a Chrome-based browser with client certificates.
*   The targeted endpoint should be non-authenticated.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Spring Framework versions 5.2.0 to 5.2.2.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Spring Framework version 5.2.3.
*   Using Spring Security with URL-based security and CORS support enabled mitigates this issue.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Eric Zimanyi from Google.
