{
  "CVE-2020-5311": {
    "Description": "An out-of-bounds write flaw was discovered in python-pillow in the way SGI RLE images are decoded. An application that uses python-pillow to decode untrusted images may be vulnerable to this flaw, which can allow an attacker to crash the application or potentially execute code on the system.",
    "Root cause": "The `expandrow()` function in `SgiRleDecode.c` does not properly validate the image size when reading compressed rows, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could potentially cause a crash or execute code on a system by exploiting the out-of-bounds write when decoding specially crafted SGI images.",
     "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted SGI image to an application that utilizes the python-pillow library for image decoding.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious image to a service that utilizes the vulnerable library."
