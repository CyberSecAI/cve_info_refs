Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-5976:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The NVIDIA GeForce NOW application's network test component transmits sensitive information insecurely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Insecure transmission of sensitive information within the application's network test component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Information disclosure. The sensitive data transmitted insecurely could be intercepted by an attacker, leading to the exposure of potentially confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
Network-based. The vulnerability is triggered through the network test component which makes it exploitable by an attacker who has a position on the network where the communication is taking place.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be positioned such that they can intercept the insecure network communication made by the application's network test component. The attacker also needs to induce a user to initiate the test. The user interaction requirement is shown in the CVSS vector as "UI:R"

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects NVIDIA GeForce NOW application on Windows, macOS, Android, and Android TV.
*   The fix is included in version 2.0.23 and later for Windows and macOS, and 5.31 and later for Android and Android TV.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Martino Trevisan.
*   The CVSS v3.0 score is 3.1, with a vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N. This indicates a low-severity vulnerability, due to the requirement for attacker positioning to intercept communications and the need for user interaction.
