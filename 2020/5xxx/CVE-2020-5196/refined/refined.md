Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Cerberus FTP Server handled permissions when users had the "zip/unzip" permission. The server did not enforce granular permissions correctly when zipping and unzipping files through the HTTP(S) interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Permission Bypass:** Users with zip permissions could include files and folders in a zip archive that they didn't have explicit access to, bypassing visibility restrictions.
*   **Directory Creation Bypass:** Users with unzip permissions could extract directories even if they lacked the "Create Directory" permission, leading to unauthorized directory creation.
*   **Inconsistent Permissions:** The zip/unzip permissions granted implied permissions that were not well defined and conflicted with specific administrator-applied permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:** Attackers could gain access to files and directories they were not supposed to see or access by using the zip functionality.
*   **Unauthorized Directory Creation:** Attackers could create directories in locations where they did not have permission to do so via the unzip functionality.
*   **Data Exposure:** Sensitive data could be exposed if attackers could include it in a zip file.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The ability to create directories and expose files could be used as a stepping stone for more complex attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the HTTP(S) web interface of Cerberus FTP Server.
*   The attacker must be a valid user with the zip/unzip permission enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid user account with the zip/unzip permission enabled on the Cerberus FTP Server.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the server's HTTP(S) interface.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affects Cerberus FTP Server Enterprise Edition.
*   Non-Enterprise editions and other transfer protocols like FTP, SFTP, and FTPS are not affected.
*   The fix was implemented in versions 11.0.3 and 10.0.18.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by security researcher Quinn Zapata.
