  "vulnerability_information": {
    "root_cause": "The HTTP interface of the Grandstream UCM6200 series has a SQL injection vulnerability in the 'Forgot Password' feature.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
       "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute shell commands as root or inject arbitrary HTML into password recovery emails.",
    "attack_vectors": "Crafted HTTP requests to the 'Forgot Password' feature.",
    "required_capabilities": "No authentication is required. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device."

     "versions": {
        "remote_code_execution": "Versions before 1.0.19.20 are vulnerable to remote code execution.",

     },
      "exploitation_details": {
        "remote_code_execution_method": "By injecting SQL code into the username field, the attacker can introduce shell metacharacters into a popen call, resulting in command execution.",
         "html_injection_method": "By injecting HTML code into the username field, the attacker can embed arbitrary HTML content into the password recovery email. The email client interprets the injected HTML, including links, thereby potentially revealing the password if a crafted link is clicked.",
