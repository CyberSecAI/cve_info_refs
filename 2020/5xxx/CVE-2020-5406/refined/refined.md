Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5406:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from PCF Autoscaling (part of VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs) logging its database connection properties, including the database username and password, to its log files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Credentials Exposure:** Database credentials (username and password) are written to log files in plaintext, creating a security vulnerability.
-  **Insufficient Access Control:** Access to the logs containing sensitive database credentials is not adequately restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** A malicious actor with access to the log files can gain unauthorized access to the database used by Autoscaling by using the exposed credentials.
- **Potential Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Log File Access:** The attack vector involves gaining access to the log files generated by PCF Autoscaling.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  **Access to Log Files:** The attacker must have access to the log files generated by the vulnerable PCF Autoscaling component. This could be through compromised systems, insider threats, or other means that allow access to the logs.
-  No specific user roles or level of privileges within the affected application is mentioned. However, they would need access to the filesystem with the logs.

**Affected Versions:**
- VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs:
    - 2.6.x versions prior to 2.6.18
    - 2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.11
    - 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.5
