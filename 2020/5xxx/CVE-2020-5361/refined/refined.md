Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-5361:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a BIOS password reset capability present in select Dell Client Commercial and Consumer platforms. This feature, intended to help authorized users who forget their passwords, is being exploited by unauthorized password generation tools.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unauthorized password generation tools can generate BIOS recovery passwords.
- These tools are not authorized by Dell.
- The BIOS password reset mechanism is vulnerable to manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A physically present attacker can reset BIOS passwords and BIOS-managed Hard Disk Drive (HDD) passwords using the unauthorized tools.
- This allows the attacker to bypass security restrictions for:
    - BIOS Setup configuration.
    - HDD access.
    - BIOS pre-boot authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Physical access to the vulnerable system is required.
- The attacker uses unauthorized password generation tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the targeted Dell system.
- The attacker does not require authentication on the system.

**Additional Details:**
- Dell recommends enabling the "Master Password Lockout" feature in the BIOS to mitigate this vulnerability. This feature, available on all commercial platforms with Insyde BIOS release from March 2024 onwards and for all other platforms starting from 2011, prevents BIOS Admin, BIOS System, and HDD passwords from being reset.
- A warning is given: If the Master Password Lockout is enabled, and the user forgets the password, Dell cannot help with recovery, and the motherboard or hard drive might need to be replaced.
- The article provides a list of identifiers that indicate affected platforms.
- The vulnerability affects select Dell Client Commercial and Consumer systems that have a BIOS password reset feature.
