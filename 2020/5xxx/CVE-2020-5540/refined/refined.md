Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-5540:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation on the ACTION parameter within CyberMail versions 6.x and 7.x. This allows for the injection of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The primary vulnerability is an XSS issue (CWE-79), where malicious scripts can be injected into the application.
*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input through the ACTION parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they access the vulnerable page.
*   **Compromised User Sessions:** The attacker can potentially steal session cookies, redirect the user to malicious websites, or perform actions on the user's behalf, leading to a compromise of user sessions.
*   **Wide Scope of Impact:** The vulnerability affects various mail systems used by governments, organizations, companies, and universities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **ACTION Parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is through the manipulation of the `ACTION` parameter in a URL request.
*   **Network:** The attacker interacts with the application through the network via a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires a user to visit a specially crafted link containing the malicious script in the `ACTION` parameter. This could be achieved through various social engineering techniques, such as phishing emails or malicious links.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the CyberMail application.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** CyberMail versions 6.x and 7.x are vulnerable.
*   **Patch Availability:** A patch (hotfix_cmv7sp3_200616) has been released for CyberMail 7.x. CyberMail 6.x is no longer supported and will not receive a patch.
*   **CVSS Scores:**
    *   **CVSS v3:** 6.1 (Medium) - AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
    *   **CVSS v2:** 4.3 (Medium) - AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N
