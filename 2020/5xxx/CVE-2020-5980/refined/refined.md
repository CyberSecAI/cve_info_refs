Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-5980:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how a securely loaded system DLL in the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver loads its dependencies. The process is insecure, allowing for potential exploitation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure DLL loading mechanism. Specifically, a securely loaded system DLL loads its dependencies in an insecure fashion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code Execution: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the system.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability can also lead to a denial of service, making the system unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access (AV:L): The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- Low Attack Complexity (AC:L): The attack is relatively easy to perform.
- Low Privileges Required (PR:L): The attacker does not need high-level privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- No User Interaction (UI:N): The attack does not require any user interaction.
- Unchanged Scope (S:U): The scope of the vulnerability is unchanged.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable DLL loading process.
