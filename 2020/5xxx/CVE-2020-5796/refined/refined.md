Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Improper preservation of file permissions during the execution of the `autodiscover_new.php` script in Nagios XI 5.7.4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `autodiscover_new.php` script, when run with specific parameters, can modify the permissions of any file specified in the `--output` parameter, making it writable by the 'nagios' user. This is possible due to the lack of proper permission checks within the script.
- The `apache` and `nagios` users are allowed to execute `autodiscover_new.php` with root privileges via `sudo` without a password.
- The `npcd` service configuration file, `npcd.cfg`, is writable by the `apache` user, allowing modification of the serviceâ€™s launch configuration.
- The `apache` user is also allowed to manage the `npcd` service through the `manage_services.sh` script, using `sudo`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local, low-privileged, authenticated user (such as `nagios` or `apache`) can exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges.
- By weakening file permissions, a low-privileged user can overwrite the vulnerable `autodiscover_new.php` file, which would allow the execution of arbitrary PHP code as root.
- Through modifying the `npcd` service configuration, an attacker can achieve remote code execution as `nagios` and, subsequently, root.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is local. An attacker must have shell access and be able to run commands using the `nagios` or `apache` user.
- An attacker can use the `autodiscover_new.php` script with a crafted `--output` to modify file permissions.
- Alternatively, the attacker can modify the `npcd.cfg` file using the apache user, along with `manage_services.sh` to restart the npcd service to achieve code execution with elevated privileges.
- The exploit can be triggered by a web-based vulnerability that allows the execution of commands via the 'apache' user, leading to local privilege escalation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local shell access with the ability to execute commands as either the `nagios` or `apache` user.
- Ability to use `sudo` to run specific scripts (`autodiscover_new.php`, and `manage_services.sh`) without a password.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory provides a detailed Proof of Concept (PoC) showing how to overwrite the `autodiscover_new.php` script and use the `npcd` service to achieve code execution as root.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-5796.
- The affected product is Nagios XI 5.7.4.
- The fix is to upgrade to Nagios XI 5.7.5 or newer.
