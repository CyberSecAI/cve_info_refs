Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper handling or checking of exceptional conditions (CWE-703) in the MELSEC iQ-F series FX5U(C) CPU modules. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the CPU module processes specially crafted ARP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper check or handling of exceptional conditions (CWE-703) when processing ARP packets. This leads to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful attack results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Program execution and communication on the affected CPU module will stop working.
- A reset of the CPU module is required to recover from the DoS state.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Ethernet port of the CPU module.
- The attacker sends specially crafted ARP packets to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the affected device (adjacent network).
- No authentication or special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability (network access is enough).
