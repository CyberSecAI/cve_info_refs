- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A directory traversal vulnerability exists in Spring Cloud Config Server due to insufficient input sanitization or validation when processing specially crafted URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the ability to use a crafted URL to bypass intended restrictions and access arbitrary files on the server. This is a directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can send a request using a specially crafted URL that can lead to a directory traversal attack, potentially allowing them to access sensitive configuration files or other resources on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through specially crafted URLs sent to the spring-cloud-config-server module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable spring-cloud-config-server instance. The advisory notes that the server should be on an internal network, implying that the attacker needs access to that network, or needs to be able to bypass any network security controls that protect the config server from external access.  It also notes that the config server should be secured with Spring Security, implying an attacker would need to bypass or have valid credentials for authentication to the config server.
