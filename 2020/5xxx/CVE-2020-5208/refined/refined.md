{
  "CVE-2020-5208": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple functions in ipmitool neglect proper checking of the data received from a remote LAN, leading to buffer overflows.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Buffer overflow"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution, denial of service, and memory corruption.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Crafted payloads sent over a network/LAN to an IPMI device"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "Attacker needs to send malicious network traffic to an IPMI-enabled device."
      ]
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `read_fru_area_section` and `read_fru_area` functions in `lib/ipmi_fru.c` do not properly validate the size of the response data received from an IPMI device, leading to a buffer overflow.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Buffer overflow due to insufficient size validation"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Potential remote code execution on the ipmitool side, memory corruption, and DoS.",
       "Attack vectors": [
         "Sending a response with a larger size than requested by ipmitool over LAN."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "Attacker needs to be able to communicate with the ipmitool via network and send a response that is larger than requested."
      ]
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple functions in ipmitool fail to validate in-memory buffer offsets when receiving data from a LAN, leading to heap based buffer overflows.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow",
         "Lack of proper input validation"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption, denial of service, and potential remote code execution.",
       "Attack vectors": [
         "Crafting special payloads via network that trigger the vulnerable code paths in ipmitool."

      "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "Attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable ipmitool instance."
