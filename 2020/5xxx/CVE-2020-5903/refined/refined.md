Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-5903:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The F5 BIG-IP Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI) improperly handles user input.
*   Specifically, the TMUI fails to neutralize untrusted user input, leading to multiple vulnerabilities.
*   The TMUI does not enforce proper authentication and authorization.
*   The TMUI web interface does not normalize user's input to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   Lack of role-based access checks allows for unexpected file access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-74):** The most severe vulnerability is a remotely exploitable command injection flaw.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The TMUI is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to improper input handling.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The TMUI is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The TMUI does not properly restrict access to sensitive configuration files.
*   Improper authentication and authorization

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Command Execution:** An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the TMUI can execute arbitrary system commands.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Attackers can create/delete files, disable services, and ultimately execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
*   **Configuration File Manipulation:** Authenticated users can perform unexpected activities like changing configuration files.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially access or exfiltrate sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is network access to the TMUI.
*   **Unauthenticated Exploitation:** Command injection vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers, making it a critical issue.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerabilities are present in the TMUI web interface.
*   **Malicious Input:** Attackers inject malicious input through the web interface.
*   **SCP:** An authenticated user can use SCP to access and modify sensitive configuration files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access to TMUI:** The attacker needs network access to the F5 BIG-IP TMUI.
*   **No Authentication (for command injection):** The most severe impact (command execution) can be achieved without authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The document mentions that the TMUI should not be directly accessible from the internet, but many installations do not follow this recommendation.
*   The document lists several related CVEs affecting F5 BIG-IP.
*   The vulnerabilities were reported by Mikhail Klyuchnikov of Positive Technologies.
*   The advisory recommends applying F5 updates and restricting access to the TMUI to trusted networks as workarounds.
