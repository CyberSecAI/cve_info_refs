### CVE-2020-5761
**Root cause of vulnerability:** The TR-069 service enters an infinite loop when it receives a TCP message lacking a carriage return character ('\r').
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of TCP messages by the TR-069 service leads to a CPU exhaustion.
**Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack results in complete CPU exhaustion, effectively causing a denial-of-service condition until the device is rebooted.
**Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted TCP message without a carriage return character to the TR-069 service port (7547).
**Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Unauthenticated remote attacker. Sending a single character is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability.
