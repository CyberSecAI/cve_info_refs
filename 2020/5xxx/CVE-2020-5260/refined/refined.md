{
  "CVE-2020-5260": {
    "description": "With a crafted URL that contains a newline in it, the credential helper machinery can be fooled to give credential information for a wrong host.  The attack has been made impossible by forbidding a newline character in any value passed via the credential protocol.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The credential protocol used by Git to communicate with helper applications doesn't properly handle newline characters in values, leading to protocol injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of newline characters in the credential protocol.",
        "Blindly transmitting values with newlines in credential_write().",
	    "Lack of input validation for newline characters in URLs before writing them to the protocol."
      ],
      "impact": "Credentials for a legitimate host can be sent to a malicious host.",
      "attack_vector": "A crafted URL containing a percent-encoded newline (%0a) in a component (e.g., username, hostname) or by injecting credential-protocol syntax (e.g. host=example.com).",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL to be used with git clone. The most likely way for such URL to appear is through submodules or package systems that rely on git"
