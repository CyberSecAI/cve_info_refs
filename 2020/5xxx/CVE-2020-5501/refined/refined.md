Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to the fact that previous versions of phpBB did not properly enforce form tokens when changing group avatars and handling pending group memberships.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Lack of proper form token enforcement on changing group avatars.
- Lack of proper form token enforcement when handling pending group memberships.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker could trick users into performing unwanted actions by exploiting the lack of proper form token enforcement.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector involves tricking a user into submitting a form without a valid token. This could be done through a crafted link or form on an external website.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious links or forms and trick a logged-in user into interacting with them.
