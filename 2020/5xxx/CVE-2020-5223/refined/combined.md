## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

# HTML injection via unescaped attachment filename #554

## Description

![@elrido](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1017622?v=4&size=48)[elrido](https://github.com/elrido)opened [on Dec 25, 2019](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues/554#issue-542288595)

I investigated the error condition found in the [property based unit test](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/blob/master/tst/README.md#property-based-unit-testing) with [RNG state 8b8f0d4ec2a67139b5](https://travis-ci.org/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/jobs/629180605#L782) for the `AttachmentViewer` class in an unrelated change.

The error occurs in the `AttachmentViewer.moveAttachmentTo()` method, were we can provide a string that will have the filename inserted in place of any `%s` in that string and which then becomes the text node of the link to download the attachment. The error condition that jsverify found was when it generated a prefix `<a` for that label (so the label generated in that test case became `<a%s`). Since we insert that label untouched, it attempts to set another link into text node of a link, which isn't allowed in HTML and in the jsdom based environment gets silently ignored - Hence the test failed only for `<a />` tags, as other tags are allowed inside a link.

While the label itself is from a trusted source (hardcoded in the translation files and privatebin.js), the filename that is injected isn't. If one would create a paste with attachment with a name containing HTML code (that can be easily done using one of the CLI clients), that paste would have that snippet injected when the paste is displayed.

I have prepared a patch and updated unit test case that does the HTML entity encoding to address this and will push this ASAP. While file uploads are disabled by default, I would still suggest that we publish a release with this fix.

Your opinions?

# [Release v1.3.2 & v1.2.2 - Fix for persistent XSS vulnerability in filenames of attached files](https://privatebin.info/news/v1.3.2-v1.2.2-release.html "Permalink to Release v1.3.2 & v1.2.2 - Fix for persistent XSS vulnerability in filenames of attached files")

[Release](https://privatebin.info/tag/release.html)

**This release fixes a persistent XSS vulnerability in filenames of attached files in PrivateBin.**

On 25th of December 2019, an issue was discovered and fixed, which allowed the user provided attachment file name to inject HTML under certain conditions, leading to a persistent [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) vulnerability. This release includes an improved solution, which addresses the issue on a broader scope, avoiding this to reoccur in other areas of the code in the future.

Further details on this is an issue and its implications can be found in our [report on the vulnerability](https://privatebin.info/reports/vulnerability-2020-01-11.html). It also describes methods to check if your browser is currently affected by the issue. If it is, please consider updating your browser.

## Benefits of switching to the new release

We recommend to upgrade 1.3, 1.3.1, 1.2 and 1.2.1 instances to address this issue, even if the instance doesn't have fileuploads enabled and uses the recommended CSP header to mitigate XSS attacks.

Due to the seriousness of the issue, we do offer a backport of the fix for the 1.2.1 version of PrivateBin, that also includes updated JavaScript libraries. You may choose to use that version over 1.3.2, if you do need to support legacy browsers with incomplete or missing Webcrypto API, like IE, non-Chromium based Edge or some ESR releases.

## Update procedure

As usual, you can [download the archive](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/releases/latest) for a manual upgrade and can find more details in the [installation instructions](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/blob/master/doc/Installation.md#installation).

We also offer a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/privatebin/nginx-fpm-alpine/) that includes the recommended secure setup with the non-essential files and data outside of the web servers document root.

## Changes

### in 1.3.2 since version 1.3.1

* ADDED: Translation for Ukrainian (#533)
* ADDED: Option to send a mail with the link, when creating a paste (#398)
* ADDED: Add support for CONFIG\_PATH environment variable (#552)
* CHANGED: Upgrading libraries to: base-x 3.0.7, DOMpurify 2.0.7 & Showdown 1.9.1
* FIXED: HTML injection via unescaped attachment filename (#554)
* FIXED: Password disabling option (#527)

### in 1.2.2 since version 1.2.1

* CHANGED: Upgrading libraries to: bootstrap 3.4.1, DOMpurify 2.0.7, jQuery 3.4.1, kjua 0.6.0, Showdown 1.9.1 & SJCL 1.0.8
* FIXED: HTML injection via unescaped attachment filename (#554)

## Help wanted & greatly appreciated

Apart from the large tasks that require deeper insight and time, there are also [smaller issues were help is wanted](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22), topics [open to debate](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22discuss+me%22+) and of course many languages that still remain to be [translated](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Translation). We are also still looking for additional long term maintainers among our frequent issue helpers.

If you are interested in helping with any of these points, we have prepared a [development guide](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Development) including design goals, code structure and tools that should get you started.

## Plans for future releases

The next regular release will focus on [user interface improvements](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/milestone/6).

# Persistent XSS vulnerability in filename of attached file in PrivateBin < 1.3.2/1.2.2 (2020-01-11)

Moderate

[elrido](/elrido)
published
GHSA-8j72-p2wm-6738
Jan 11, 2020

## Package

composer

privatebin
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 1.2

## Patched versions

1.3.2 / 1.2.2

## Description

On 24th of December 2019 one of the [property based unit tests](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/blob/master/tst/README.md#property-based-unit-testing) reported a [failure](https://travis-ci.org/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/jobs/629180605#L782). Upon investigation, [@elrido](https://github.com/elrido) discovered that the failure was due to unescaped HTML, which allowed the user provided attachment file name to inject HTML under certain conditions leading to a persistent [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) vulnerability. After committing an [initial fix](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/commit/8d0ac336d23cd8c98e71d5f21cdadcae9c8a26e6) to the master branch, the [issue was reported](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues/554) on 25th of December. Vulnerability write-up done by [@rugk](https://github.com/rugk) and [@elrido](https://github.com/elrido).

The vulnerability has been fixed in [PrivateBin v1.3.2 & v1.2.2](https://privatebin.info/news/v1.3.2-v1.2.2-release.html). Admins are urged to upgrade to these versions to protect the affected users.

## Affected versions

Any PrivateBin version since 1.2.

## Conditions

* The configuration setting `fileupload` has to be enabled, as 1.3 displays an error when trying to open a paste with attachment.
* The CSP header rules don't get applied. For example:
  + They are unsupported or disabled in the visitors browser.
  + They are filtered out by a some proxy server at the server or client side.
  + The header is disabled/commented in the PHP-logic.
  + The rules have been relaxed in the `cspheader` configuration setting.
* A paste with a malicious filename is created.
* A visitor of that paste clicks on the "Clone" button.

## Proof of concept

The following method is just one possibility to exploit this issue and is provided as a proof of concept with steps to reproduce the issue. To avoid having to create an actual file with a rogue filename, one could use the [Python CLI client for PrivateBin](https://github.com/r4sas/PBinCLI/) and [edit line 56 in `format.py`](https://github.com/r4sas/PBinCLI/blob/682b47fbd3e24a8a53c3b484ba896a5dbc85cda2/pbincli/format.py#L56) as follows:

```
-        self._attachment_name = path_leaf(path)
+        self._attachment_name = '<script>alert("☹️");//<a'
```

The paste then can be created on a vulnerable instance:

```
$ python pbincli/cli.py send -t " " -f /dev/null -s https://privatebin.net/
```

Visiting the created paste on a vulnerable instance, with `fileupload` enabled and the CSP header weakened or disabled, and clicking the clone button will insert the HTML unescaped. In the above example, a pop-up would appear, when the script is executed.

## Impact

On a vulnerable site pastes with malicious filenames can be created and users visiting these could inadvertently trigger the code execution when they click the "Clone" button. They could be instigated to do so via social engineering, like a paste text suggesting to "clone and share" the paste in question.

The attached file itself doesn't have to be empty and could be an image or document that would still be displayed inline as usual. The execution of the script triggered by clicking on the "Clone" button may occur silently in the background without showing any noticeable signs in browser. It may for instance be used to track visitors, start drive-by-downloads or similar. While we focus on script injection here, as it is the easiest exploit vector, it has to be said that anything else can be injected like CSS, images, videos, although the default CSP will block inline CSS and images, e.g.

On first visit, the filename isn't visible and is properly escaped when inserted into the download attribute. Only when clicking the "Download attachment" link would open a file save dialog with an odd name pre-filled, although browsers will convert illegal characters into valid ones, so it may not be identical to the one provided. Only when the "Clone" button has been clicked and after the exploit has already been triggered, the filename gets displayed. Note that an attacker can of course prevent this indicator of compromise to be shown and e.g. change the displayed text or obfuscate the filename by starting it with something harmless, like `image.png`, before opening the HTML tag.

### Impact restrictions

The impact is mitigated by the fact that the vulnerability is, as far as our investigation concluded, paste-specific, i.e. opening a vulnerable paste can only compromise this one paste and no other pastes.

Furthermore, as stated before, the impact is mitigated by the fact that we deploy a strong [CSP](https://content-security-policy.com/) that, by default, does not allow inline JS or other potentially easy methods that would allow an easy exploitation of the vulnerability.

That said, we have to make users aware, that there may always be tricks to bypass such a CSP and the simple injection of HTML tags, e.g. destroying, faking or somehow phishing an HTML page does always remain a possibility.

As such, we treat this as a security vulnerability with medium severity. It is critical on it's own, but we believe that the deployed security mechanisms should prevent an exploit in practice in most cases.

## Real-life impact

We checked all instances listed in the [PrivateBin directory in the Wiki](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/PrivateBin-Directory) and didn't find any 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3 instances that had the CSP headers disabled or in a state we know to be vulnerable. We used the following script, that may be adapted to check the CSP headers of any single instance:

```
for URL in $(
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/PrivateBin-Directory.md | grep -Po '^http.*?(?= )'
)
do
    echo -n "$URL: "
    curl -sLI $URL | grep -Poi 'content-security-policy.*script-src.?\K.*?(?=;)' || echo 'No CSP detected!'
done
```

Some of the above sites do offer file uploads. On these instances, it is still possible that a visitor could have CSP support disabled in their browser, i.e. via a transparent proxy at their internet uplink or due to a browser plugin or some other locally installed, misguided security solution.

**Important:** This scan is only a cursory check and *must not* be taken as a security analysis of any means! You are always responsible for the security of your own instance. Please do check it manually!

## Mitigation

As server administrators can't detect if a paste contains file attachments at all (apart from their size) in version 1.3 and due to the encrypted filename in older versions, as well as the risk for clients that don't apply the CSP settings, we urge them to upgrade to versions 1.3.2 or 1.2.2.

If you use v1.3, you could disable the `fileupload` setting to prevent pastes from getting displayed that may contain this vulnerability. Note that this will break all existing pastes with uploads, however, so we do *not* recommend this, but advise you to upgrade to a fixed version instead.

## Further information

We want to make potential third-party client authors aware of this vulnerability and urge them to double-check their implementations. If they develop a client that displays untrusted foreign data from a paste in a HTML site, please make sure to escape it to prevent XSS attacks. Such attacks can only be prevented when the paste is displayed, a mitigation when a paste is created is pointless, as a different client can be used during creation.

We do also acknowledge and want to highlight the benefit of the CSP, which has first been [introduced in PrivateBin v1.0](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues/10).

However, we want to make you again aware that a whitelist-based CSP as we use, may [sometimes still be bypassed](https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/faq.html#problems-with-whitelists), e.g. if you host a copy of the Angular library on the same domain as your PrivateBin instance.

We are aware of that and [do consider](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues/108) upgrading to a stronger CSP in the future.

### Issue discovery

While it is satisfying that our hard work on introducing unit tests has payed off in the discovery and mitigation of this vulnerability, it does also show a limitation of unit testing. A third party doing a code review would have certainly focused on how the project handles user provided input and may have discovered this much quicker.

The discovery wasn't due to the unit test checking for HTML input to get properly escaped, on the contrary, the test assumed input would not be changed. So other instances of HTML tags generated would have happily passed the test. Only when the test generated a fragment of a link (`<a`) it failed, because the DOM silently removed it when it inserted the string, as links within links aren't allowed. While the test was written to throw arbitrary strings at the `AttachmentViewer.moveAttachmentTo()` method, the test would only check that these got inserted into the DOM unchanged, oblivious of their potential significance when interpreted as HTML.

The [test had been introduced](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/commit/39860dfdc434c00d18342b4fb3bc6f5d0960030d) on December 3rd, 2017, 570 commits ago. Every commit on master and in PRs since introduction in that commit triggers these tests to run for every supported PHP version. Additional test cycles get run on developers local environments during working on commits. Hence the test suite must have run a few thousand times, testing 100 random strings each time. And only after more then 2 years a string containing `<a` got generated, triggered the error condition and 22 shrinks later the smallest failing test case was presented as:

```
Failed after 65 tests and 22 shrinks. rngState: 8b8f0d4ec2a67139b5; Counterexample: "image/png"; ""; "\u0000"; "<a"; "";

```

Discussion about a potential problem with that code, [did spark last September](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/pull/508#commitcomment-34943221), when the vulnerable code part was changed to the one before before the current fix, but was [incorrectly judged](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/pull/508#commitcomment-34944396) as not being a problem, because all of our translation strings are hardcoded. The fact that we do actually add some untrusted user-provided content, wasn't considered at that point.

It should also be mentioned, that the coverage report released for version 1.3.1 did highlight the line that caused this vulnerability as not being covered during testing:

[![Coverage report for version 1.3.1 showing missing test coverage for line causing vulnerability](%7Bstatic%7D/img/vulnerability-2020-01-11/coverage.png)](%7Bstatic%7D/img/vulnerability-2020-01-11/coverage.png)

So, in conclusion, it is great to have all of these tools at our disposal, but the code quality would benefit a lot more from having more eyeballs and brains on it.

**This release fixes a persistent XSS vulnerability in filenames of attached files in PrivateBin.**

On 25th of December 2019, an issue was discovered and fixed, which allowed the user provided attachment file name to inject HTML under certain conditions, leading to a persistent [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) vulnerability. This release includes an improved solution, which addresses the issue on a broader scope, avoiding this to reoccur in other areas of the code in the future.

Further details on this is an issue and its implications can be found in our [report on the vulnerability](https://privatebin.info/reports/vulnerability-2020-01-11.html). It also describes methods to check if your browser is currently affected by the issue. If it is, please consider updating your browser.

## Benefits of switching to the new release

We recommend to upgrade 1.3, 1.3.1, 1.2 and 1.2.1 instances to address this issue, even if the instance doesn't have fileuploads enabled and uses the recommended CSP header to mitigate XSS attacks.

Due to the seriousness of the issue, we do offer a backport of the fix for the 1.2.1 version of PrivateBin, that also includes updated JavaScript libraries. You may choose to use that version over 1.3.2, if you do need to support legacy browsers with incomplete or missing Webcrypto API, like IE, non-Chromium based Edge or some ESR releases.

## Update procedure

As usual, you can [download the archive](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/releases/latest) for a manual upgrade and can find more details in the [installation instructions](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/blob/master/doc/Installation.md#installation).

We also offer a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/privatebin/nginx-fpm-alpine/) that includes the recommended secure setup with the non-essential files and data outside of the web servers document root.

## Changes since version 1.3.1

* ADDED: Translation for Ukrainian ([#533](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/pull/533))
* ADDED: Option to send a mail with the link, when creating a paste ([#398](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues/398))
* ADDED: Add support for CONFIG\_PATH environment variable ([#552](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues/552))
* CHANGED: Upgrading libraries to: base-x 3.0.7, DOMpurify 2.0.7 & Showdown 1.9.1
* FIXED: HTML injection via unescaped attachment filename ([#554](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues/554))
* FIXED: Password disabling option ([#527](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues/527))

More details about the plans for future releases and on how you can help the project achieve them, can be found in the [PrivateBin version 1.3.2 & 1.2.2 release announcements](https://privatebin.info/news/v1.3.2-v1.2.2-release.html).
