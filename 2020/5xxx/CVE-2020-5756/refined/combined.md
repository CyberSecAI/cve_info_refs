# MX Player Android App Directory Traversal

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

#### CVE-2020-5764 - Directory Traversal (RCE)

The MX Transfer protocol is vulnerable to directory traversal in versions below v1.24.5. If a victim enables MX Share as a receiver, an attacker can abuse the sharing protocol by sending a *MessageType*of "*FILE\_LIST*" with a "name" field containing directory traversal characters (../). This will result in the file being transferred to the victim's phone, but being saved outside of the intended "/sdcard/MXshare" directory. In our testing, we found we could achieve remote code execution on some Android phones if the attacker sends a "../../../../../data/data/com.mxtech.videoplayer.ad/files/oat/arm64/audience\_network.odex" file and "../../../../../data/data/com.mxtech.videoplayer.ad/files/oat/arm64/audience\_network.vdex" file with appropriate payloads in order to gain code execution upon next time the app is started by the victim.

### Solution

Update to version MX Player v1.24.5 or higher

### Proof of Concept

https://github.com/tenable/poc/blob/master/MXPlayer/

### Disclosure Timeline

4/9/2020 - Tenable reaches out to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), to ask for security contact.
4/10/2020 - MX Player Support asks for disclosure.
4/12/2020 - Tenable discloses vulnerabilities to MX Player Support.
4/13/2020 - MX Player Support acknowledges disclosure report and says development and security teams are working on a fix.
4/27/2020 - Tenable follows up, asking for expected release date for fix.
5/15/2020 - Tenable follows up asking for update.

  ###### medium

  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dm array: fix releasing a faulty array block twice in dm\_array\_cursor\_end When dm\_bm\_read\_lock() fails due to locking or checksum errors, it releases the faulty block implicitly while leaving an invalid output pointer behind. The caller of dm\_bm\_read\_lock() should not operate on this invalid dm\_block pointer, or it will lead to undefined result. For example, the dm\_array\_cursor incorrectly caches the invalid pointer on reading a faulty array block, causing a double release in dm\_array\_cursor\_end(), then hitting the BUG\_ON in dm-bufio cache\_put(). Reproduce steps: 1. initialize a cache device dmsetup create cmeta --table "0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0" dmsetup create cdata --table "0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192" dmsetup create corig --table "0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144" dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/cmeta bs=4k count=1 dmsetup create cache --table "0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \ /dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0" 2. wipe the second array block offline dmsteup remove cache cmeta cdata corig mapping\_root=$(dd if=/dev/sdc bs=1c count=8 skip=192 \ 2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '1/8 "%u\n"') ablock=$(dd if=/dev/sdc bs=1c count=8 skip=$((4096\*mapping\_root+2056)) \ 2>/dev/null | hexdump -e '1/8 "%u\n"') dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=4k count=1 seek=$ablock 3. try reopen the cache device dmsetup create cmeta --table "0 8192 linear /dev/sdc 0" dmsetup create cdata --table "0 65536 linear /dev/sdc 8192" dmsetup create corig --table "0 524288 linear /dev/sdc $262144" dmsetup create cache --table "0 524288 cache /dev/mapper/cmeta \ /dev/mapper/cdata /dev/mapper/corig 128 2 metadata2 writethrough smq 0" Kernel logs: (snip) device-mapper: array: array\_block\_check failed: blocknr 0 != wanted 10 device-mapper: block manager: array validator check failed for block 10 device-mapper: array: get\_ablock failed device-mapper: cache metadata: dm\_array\_cursor\_next for mapping failed ------------[ cut here ]------------ kernel BUG at drivers/md/dm-bufio.c:638! Fix by setting the cached block pointer to NULL on errors. In addition to the reproducer described above, this fix can be verified using the "array\_cursor/damaged" test in dm-unit: dm-unit run /pdata/array\_cursor/damaged --kernel-dir <KERNEL\_DIR>
* ##### [CVE-2024-57928](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-57928)

  ###### medium

  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: netfs: Fix enomem handling in buffered reads If netfs\_read\_to\_pagecache() gets an error from either ->prepare\_read() or from netfs\_prepare\_read\_iterator(), it needs to decrement ->nr\_outstanding, cancel the subrequest and break out of the issuing loop. Currently, it only does this for two of the cases, but there are two more that aren't handled. Fix this by moving the handling to a common place and jumping to it from all four places. This is in preference to inserting a wrapper around netfs\_prepare\_read\_iterator() as proposed by Dmitry Antipov[1].
* ##### [CVE-2024-57927](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-57927)

  ###### high

  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: nfs: Fix oops in nfs\_netfs\_init\_request() when copying to cache When netfslib wants to copy some data that has just been read on behalf of nfs, it creates a new write request and calls nfs\_netfs\_init\_request() to initialise it, but with a NULL file pointer. This causes nfs\_file\_open\_context() to oops - however, we don't actually need the nfs context as we're only going to write to the cache. Fix this by just returning if we aren't given a file pointer and emit a warning if the request was for something other than copy-to-cache. Further, fix nfs\_netfs\_free\_request() so that it doesn't try to free the context if the pointer is NULL.
* ##### [CVE-2024-57926](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2024-57926)

  ###### high

  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm/mediatek: Set private->all\_drm\_private[i]->drm to NULL if mtk\_drm\_bind returns err The pointer need to be set to NULL, otherwise KASAN complains about use-after-free.

  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ksmbd: fix a missing return value check bug In the smb2\_send\_interim\_resp(), if ksmbd\_alloc\_work\_struct() fails to allocate a node, it returns a NULL pointer to the in\_work pointer. This can lead to an illegal memory write of in\_work->response\_buf when allocate\_interim\_rsp\_buf() attempts to perform a kzalloc() on it. To address this issue, incorporating a check for the return value of ksmbd\_alloc\_work\_struct() ensures that the function returns immediately upon allocation failure, thereby preventing the aforementioned illegal memory access.

  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fs: relax assertions on failure to encode file handles Encoding file handles is usually performed by a filesystem >encode\_fh() method that may fail for various reasons. The legacy users of exportfs\_encode\_fh(), namely, nfsd and name\_to\_handle\_at(2) syscall are ready to cope with the possibility of failure to encode a file handle. There are a few other users of exportfs\_encode\_{fh,fid}() that currently have a WARN\_ON() assertion when ->encode\_fh() fails. Relax those assertions because they are wrong. The second linked bug report states commit 16aac5ad1fa9 ("ovl: support encoding non-decodable file handles") in v6.6 as the regressing commit, but this is not accurate. The aforementioned commit only increases the chances of the assertion and allows triggering the assertion with the reproducer using overlayfs, inotify and drop\_caches. Triggering this assertion was always possible with other filesystems and other reasons of ->encode\_fh() failures and more particularly, it was also possible with the exact same reproducer using overlayfs that is mounted with options index=on,nfs\_export=on also on kernels < v6.6. Therefore, I am not listing the aforementioned commit as a Fixes commit. Backport hint: this patch will have a trivial conflict applying to v6.6.y, and other trivial conflicts applying to stable kernels < v6.6.

  ###### medium

  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ovl: support encoding fid from inode with no alias Dmitry Safonov reported that a WARN\_ON() assertion can be trigered by userspace when calling inotify\_show\_fdinfo() for an overlayfs watched inode, whose dentry aliases were discarded with drop\_caches. The WARN\_ON() assertion in inotify\_show\_fdinfo() was removed, because it is possible for encoding file handle to fail for other reason, but the impact of failing to encode an overlayfs file handle goes beyond this assertion. As shown in the LTP test case mentioned in the link below, failure to encode an overlayfs file handle from a non-aliased inode also leads to failure to report an fid with FAN\_DELETE\_SELF fanotify events. As Dmitry notes in his analyzis of the problem, ovl\_encode\_fh() fails if it cannot find an alias for the inode, but this failure can be fixed. ovl\_encode\_fh() seldom uses the alias and in the case of non-decodable file handles, as is often the case with fanotify fid info, ovl\_encode\_fh() never needs to use the alias to encode a file handle. Defer finding an alias until it is actually needed so ovl\_encode\_fh() will not fail in the common case of FAN\_DELETE\_SELF fanotify events.

  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ipvlan: Fix use-after-free in ipvlan\_get\_iflink(). syzbot presented an use-after-free report [0] regarding ipvlan and linkwatch. ipvlan does not hold a refcnt of the lower device unlike vlan and macvlan. If the linkwatch work is triggered for the ipvlan dev, the lower dev might have already been freed, resulting in UAF of ipvlan->phy\_dev in ipvlan\_get\_iflink(). We can delay the lower dev unregistration like vlan and macvlan by holding the lower dev's refcnt in dev->netdev\_ops->ndo\_init() and releasing it in dev->priv\_destructor(). Jakub pointed out calling .ndo\_XXX after unregister\_netdevice() has returned is error prone and suggested [1] addressing this UAF in the core by taking commit 750e51603395 ("net: avoid potential UAF in default\_operstate()") further. Let's assume unregistering devices DOWN and use RCU protection in default\_operstate() not to race with the device unregistration.

  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: hns3: fixed hclge\_fetch\_pf\_reg accesses bar space out of bounds issue The TQP BAR space is divided into two segments. TQPs 0-1023 and TQPs 1024-1279 are in different BAR space addresses. However, hclge\_fetch\_pf\_reg does not distinguish the tqp space information when reading the tqp space information. When the number of TQPs is greater than 1024, access bar space overwriting occurs. The problem of different segments has been considered during the initialization of tqp.io\_base. Therefore, tqp.io\_base is directly used when the queue is read in hclge\_fetch\_pf\_reg.

  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: netfilter: conntrack: clamp maximum hashtable size to INT\_MAX Use INT\_MAX as maximum size for the conntrack hashtable. Otherwise, it is possible to hit WARN\_ON\_ONCE in \_\_kvmalloc\_node\_noprof() when resizing hashtable because \_\_GFP\_NOWARN is unset. See: 0708a0afe291 ("mm: Consider \_\_GFP\_NOWARN flag for oversized kvmalloc() calls") Note: hashtable resize is only possible from init\_netns.

  ###### medium

  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: sched: sch\_cake: add bounds checks to host bulk flow fairness counts Even though we fixed a logic error in the commit cited below, syzbot still managed to trigger an underflow of the per-host bulk flow counters, leading to an out of bounds memory access. To avoid any such logic errors causing out of bounds memory accesses, this commit factors out all accesses to the per-host bulk flow counters to a series of helpers that perform bounds-checking before any increments and decrements. This also has the benefit of improving readability by moving the conditional checks for the flow mode into these helpers, instead of having them spread out throughout the code (which was the cause of the original logic error). As part of this change, the flow quantum calculation is consolidated into a helper function, which means that the dithering applied to the ost load scaling is now applied both in the DRR rotation and when a sparse flow's quantum is first initiated. The only user-visible effect of this is that the maximum packet size that can be sent while a flow stays sparse will now vary with +/- one byte in some cases. This should not make a noticeable difference in practice, and thus it's not worth complicating the code to preserve the old behaviour.

  ###### medium

  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: afs: Fix the maximum cell name length The kafs filesystem limits the maximum length of a cell to 256 bytes, but a problem occurs if someone actually does that: kafs tries to create a directory under /proc/net/afs/ with the name of the cell, but that fails with a warning: WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 9 at fs/proc/generic.c:405 because procfs limits the maximum filename length to 255. However, the DNS limits the maximum lookup length and, by extension, the maximum cell name, to 255 less two (length count and trailing NUL). Fix this by limiting the maximum acceptable cellname length to 253. This also allows us to be sure we can create the "/afs/.<cell>/" mountpoint too. Further, split the YFS VL record cell name maximum to be the 256 allowed by the protocol and ignore the record retrieved by YFSVL.GetCellName if it exceeds 253.

  In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: platform/x86/amd/pmc: Only disable IRQ1 wakeup where i8042 actually enabled it Wakeup for IRQ1 should be disabled only in cases where i8042 had actually enabled it, otherwise "wake\_depth" for this IRQ will try to drop below zero and there will be an unpleasant WARN() logged: kernel: atkbd serio0: Disabling IRQ1 wakeup source to avoid platform firmware bug kernel: ------------[ cut here ]------------ kernel: Unbalanced IRQ 1 wake disable kernel: WARNING: CPU: 10 PID: 6431 at kernel/irq/manage.c:920 irq\_set\_irq\_wake+0x147/0x1a0 The PMC driver uses DEFINE\_SIMPLE\_DEV\_PM\_OPS() to define its dev\_pm\_ops which sets amd\_pmc\_suspend\_handler() to the .suspend, .freeze, and .poweroff handlers. i8042\_pm\_suspend(), however, is only set as the .suspend handler. Fix the issue by call PMC suspend handler only from the same set of dev\_pm\_ops handlers as i8042\_pm\_suspend(), which currently means just the .suspend handler. To reproduce this issue try hibernating (S4) the machine after a fresh boot without putting it into s2idle first. [ij: edited the commit message.]
