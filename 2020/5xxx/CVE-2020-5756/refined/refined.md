Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an undocumented API in Grandstream GWN7000 firmware that allows authenticated remote users to modify the system's crontab.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Undocumented API:** The presence of an undocumented API endpoint for crontab modification introduces an unexpected attack vector.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** Authenticated users, even with limited privileges, can leverage this API to modify crontab entries.
*   **Command Injection:** The ability to modify crontab entries allows for the injection of arbitrary OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary OS Command Execution:** Attackers can gain complete control over the device through the execution of arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
*   **Device Compromise:**  Successful exploitation leads to a full compromise of the affected router, enabling further malicious activities on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Network Access:** Requires the attacker to have network access to the vulnerable device.
*   **Authentication:** Attackers need to authenticate as a valid user to access the vulnerable API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attacker needs to be on the same network as the Grandstream GWN7000 router or have network access to the router
*   **Valid Credentials:** The attacker must have valid credentials for an account with access to the device's web interface.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content also references another CVE (CVE-2020-5764), but this is a separate issue related to MX Player and directory traversal.
* The vulnerable software is identified as Grandstream GWN7000 firmware versions 1.0.9.4 and below.
* Tenable assigned the advisory ID TRA-2020-41 for this issue.
*  CVSS v2 and v3 scores are high.
