Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-5622:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from overlapping "Rule IDs" assigned by the "Shadankun Server Security Type" product's internal script when processing multiple attack requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** The core vulnerability is a DoS condition (CWE-703) that prevents the system from adding new attack source IP addresses to its blocklist. This occurs when the internal script generates duplicate rule IDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability to prevent the WAF from blocking new attacks. Specifically, the WAF fails to block newly detected attack sources, making the protected web application vulnerable to attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be launched remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the network.
- **Specific Timing:** The attack must involve multiple requests from numerous IP addresses in a short time frame (under 10 microseconds), or requests from multiple IP addresses within a specific timeframe (minute/10 microsecond to 100 millisecond units, but different time by the second) to trigger the duplicate "Rule ID" generation.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects "Shadankun Server Security Type" (excluding normal blocking method types) Ver.1.5.3 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability is triggered under specific conditions of high-frequency attacks from multiple sources, which causes internal rule IDs to overlap, preventing the addition of new blocking rules.
*   The provided fix involves replacing the vulnerable script file with an updated version.
*   The vendor, Cyber Security Cloud, Inc., has acknowledged the vulnerability and provided a fix.
*   CVSS v3 score 5.3 (Medium) and CVSS v2 score 5.0 (Medium) have been assigned to this vulnerability.
