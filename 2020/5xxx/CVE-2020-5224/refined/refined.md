Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5224:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the exposure of session keys within the HTML rendered by the `django-user-sessions` application. Specifically, the session key was included in the HTML when displaying a list of active sessions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Session Key Exposure:** The session key, which is a sensitive piece of information used to identify user sessions, was being directly included in the HTML.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Risk:** The exposure of the session key in HTML, combined with a potential XSS vulnerability on the website, could allow an attacker to steal the session key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking/Takeover:** An attacker who manages to extract a valid session key can use it to hijack the corresponding user session. This would grant the attacker the same access as the legitimate user within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **XSS Vulnerability:** An attacker would need to exploit an existing XSS vulnerability within the website. This could involve injecting malicious JavaScript into a page that would then be executed when a user views the page. This script would be used to extract the exposed session keys.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** Although less likely, an attacker could potentially intercept the HTML containing the session key if the connection between the user and the server is not secure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to exploit a XSS vulnerability** on the website, which would allow the attacker to execute javascript on the victim's browser
- **Or, network access** to perform man-in-the-middle attack to intercept the HTML response.

**Additional Information:**
- The issue was addressed in version 1.7.1 of `django-user-sessions`.
- The fix involved removing the session key from the HTML templates.
- The vulnerability is considered low severity because it is predicated on the existence of a secondary vulnerability (XSS).
