Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an OS command injection flaw present in Grandstream UCM6200 series firmware.
*   The specific attack vector involves issuing a specially crafted "unset" command via SSH.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** The system fails to properly sanitize or validate the input provided to the "unset" command, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary operating system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system as the root user. This level of access grants complete control over the device.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With root access, attackers can potentially modify system settings, install malware, steal sensitive information, or disrupt the normal operations of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SSH:** The attack vector is through SSH, requiring the attacker to establish a connection to the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Grandstream UCM6200 device.
*   **Authentication:**  The attacker needs valid credentials to authenticate to the device via SSH.
*   **Crafted Command:** The attacker must craft a malicious "unset" command to achieve command injection.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Grandstream UCM6200 series firmware version 1.0.20.23 and below.
*   The CVSS v2 base score is 10, and the CVSS v3 base score is 9.8, both rated as critical.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Tenable.
