Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-5741:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Plex Media Server plugin framework deserializes untrusted data using the `pickle.load()` function without proper validation when loading a "Dict" file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The primary vulnerability is the use of Python's `pickle.load()` function on data sourced from a file controlled by the attacker. This function is known to be dangerous when used on untrusted data because it can execute arbitrary code upon deserialization.
- **Lack of Input Validation:**  The application does not validate the contents of the "Dict" file before deserializing it, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary Python code within the context of the Plex Media Server application, which runs with the privileges of the user running the application. This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be initiated remotely via HTTP requests to the Plex Media Server.
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious "Dict" file via the camera upload feature to a photo library they create.
- **Configuration Modification:** The attacker modifies the application's local data path to point to the directory containing the malicious file and then forces the "com.plexapp.system" plugin to restart, causing the malicious file to be loaded.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated with admin privileges on the Plex Media Server.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Plex Media Server to send the malicious requests.
- **Payload Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious Python pickle payload that will execute desired commands.
