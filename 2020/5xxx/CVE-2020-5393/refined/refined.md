Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The application, `app4.cloud.appspace.com`, allows users to create templates with special characters, which are not properly encoded before being rendered on the browser. This lack of encoding allows an attacker to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, specifically the failure to sanitize or encode user-provided input when rendering it on a webpage. This allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Redirection to Malicious Websites:** An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website by injecting JavaScript that performs the redirection.
*   **Session Token Theft:** Due to the lack of 'http only' flag on session cookies, an attacker could potentially steal a user's session token, gaining unauthorized access to their account.
*   **Malicious JavaScript Code Execution:**  The injected JavaScript can be used for various malicious purposes, including spreading malware, performing actions on behalf of the user, or modifying the content of the page.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** The vulnerability can be used to execute phishing attacks by displaying fake login pages or other deceptive content that aims to steal user credentials or information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Link:** The attacker creates a temporary webpage containing malicious JavaScript and shares a link to this page, that when clicked, executes the javascript code on the victim's browser. The URL can appear as `app4.cloud.appspace.com`, a genuine site, making it more likely for victims to click.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create content (templates) within the affected application or have some way of injecting the malicious code.
*   The attacker must be able to craft a malicious link, and then distribute it to the victim. The victim needs to interact with the malicious link for the attack to succeed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post mentions the vulnerability was reported to Appspace, and was subsequently fixed.
*   The suggested mitigation was to encode special characters before rendering them in the browser (similar to how Angular.js handles user input).
*   The provided screenshots illustrate how malicious JavaScript code could be injected and rendered on the page
* The `docs.appspace.com` content is primarily release notes for Appspace 7.1 platform, providing details on new features, enhancements, resolved bugs, etc. It does not directly contain information about CVE-2020-5393

**Summary**
The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in `app4.cloud.appspace.com` due to improper encoding of user-supplied input. The impact includes malicious redirection, session theft, javascript injection, and phishing attacks.
