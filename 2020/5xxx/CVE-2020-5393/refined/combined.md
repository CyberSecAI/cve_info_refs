**Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in [app4.cloud.appspace.com](https://app4.cloud.appspace.com/) cloud software**

What is it? - Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy.

Which URL is affected? -<https://app4.cloud.appspace.com/console/#!/ext/library>

The severity of this issue?

- An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious website or can steal session token(no 'http only' flag was set☺).

In this application, an attacker can create a temporary page 'webpage.html' and using this link he can spread malicious JavaScript code. The victim will observe the domain name-app4.cloud.appspace.com, which is a genuine site and clicks the malicious link.

This link can be used to spread malicious javascript or can be used for Phishing.

Did I notify Appspace security team about this vulnerability?

Yes, I Informed Appspace tech support team about this vulnerability and they said this is a known issue and will be fixed soon, they asked me to share a PoC to security@appspace.com.

 However, no response from the security team until now. a couple of days back when I tried reproducing this issue, I found that the issue was addressed in the latest build and this vulnerability is fixed now!

Suggested mitigation:

As they need to allow the special character to create the templates and this is a business requirement, I suggested them to encode the special characters before rendering on the browser like how Angular js does, but if that input is used by some other third-party apps then it will be a problem.

Following screenshots are self-explanatory and no need any explanation. Do comment if you have any questions.

## What’s New

##### First Time User Checklist

Introducing a simple high-level checklist for Appspace first time Account Owner users, providing a better user experience, while guiding users on how to get started quickly from content creation to publishing on to your device for display.

The checklist is displayed over the Appspace dashboard until all items are completed, or if it’s dismissed before returning to the normal dashboard display. Users can trigger the checklist actions by clicking the action button, or clicking the info icon to be directed to our Appspace Knowledge Center article on the subject. All Account Owners under the same account level shares the same checklist, as the checklist is tracked and controlled on the instance account level.

##### Playlist Scheduling – Dayparting

Playlist channels can now be scheduled via the Dayparting feature added to a content’s playout properties, which allows users to publish content on one or more specific dayparts, ideal to reach a certain target demographic:

* The daypart schedule can be applied to a single content or a folder with multiple content. Daypart schedules can be configured on a daily basis, or weekly, with adjustable durations for each time slot. The daypart schedule can run independently from the normal schedule.
* Frequency restrictions can be applied together with the daypart schedule, allowing content to be displayed more frequently within it’s schedule time slot based on the following options:
  + Play exactly x number of time per (min, hour, day)
  + Play at most x number of time per (min, hour, day)
  + Play every x time per playout loop
  + Play % of air time

![](https://docs.appspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/21-1024x645.png)

For configuration information, please refer to the [Create a playlist](https://docs.appspace.com/appspace/7.1/publishing-content/basic/create-edit-publish/create-playlist/) channel article.

##### Improved Channels Import and Export features

A new feature to import or export any channel type (playlist, live, advanced) from the Appspace console is added. You may share or export these channels or channel groups using an export code (URL).

Similarly, to import, you can include the URL to upload the channel to the console. As the import/export functionality for advanced channels existed prior to Appspace 7.1, you can only import an advanced channel within the same Appspace version, or from an older version to a new version. The import function is not backward compatible between major releases.

Refer to [*Import or export a channel or channel group*](https://docs.appspace.com/appspace/7.1/publishing-content/basic/create-edit-publish/import-export-channels/) for more information.

##### Improved Channel and Channel Group UI

* A ‘Publish’ filter has been added to Channels and Channel Group listings, which quickly allows users to identify channels that are published.
* An option to select or upload a custom thumbnail, when creating a new channel, or channel group.
* Improved the channels UI to indicate scheduled content by utilizing the playout properties icons to quickly identify if a schedule is currently being played, expired, or for the future.
  + Scheduled content
    - Expired schedule = Red
    - Future schedule = Yellow
    - Current playing = Blue (default)
  + Inherited scheduled content
    - Expired schedule = Red
    - Future schedule = Yellow
    - Current playing = Grey (default)

### 7.1-ac.27

*Release Date: 15 Feb 2020*
##### **Low Bandwidth Mode**

Introducing the Low Bandwidth Mode feature, which ensures customer’s bandwidth is optimized when streaming content on Appspace App devices that do not have storage capabilities, or a caching mechanism.

Previously, all content is streamed and displayed on non-caching devices directly from the Appspace server, thus resulting in high bandwidth usage, especially when streaming video content, or high-resolution media. To mitigate this, the Low Bandwidth Mode feature displays the thumbnail image of the video content during playback, instead of actually streaming the entire video. However, if there is user interactivity, then the video content is streamed and displayed in its entirety.

The Low Bandwidth Mode is enabled by default for all streaming devices such as:

* Crestron Air Media
* Crestron Mercury
* Crestron TSS
* Crestron Webex Board and Room Series
* Mersive Solstice Pod
* Devices registered via a browser on Windows/Mac running the Appspace PWA (Progressive Web App)

* Ability to customize the slide duration.
* New custom template and themes.

This card was previously a community card. However, with this new enhancement, the card is now officially an Appspace supported card that will continuously be improved by us.

The Google Slides card is currently not supported on “iOS” based devices due to bug, which would be resolved in an upcoming update of the Google Slides card.

Refer to [Create Google Slides cards](https://docs.appspace.com/appspace/7.1/publishing-content/basic/create-edit-publish/google-cards/) for more information.

##### **Channels**

Playlist channels can now be scheduled via the Dayparting feature added to a content’s playout properties, which allows users to publish content on one or more specific dayparts, ideal to reach a certain target demographic:

* Frequency restrictions can be applied together with the daypart schedule, allowing content to be displayed more frequently within it’s schedule time slot based on the following options:
  + Play exactly x number of time per (min, hour, day)
  + Play at most x number of time per (min, hour, day)
  + Play every x time per playout loop

### 7.1-ac.3

*Release Date: 27 Apr 2019*
##### **Schedule Board Card**

Introducing the Schedule Board card, which is designed for viewing the schedule of multiple meeting spaces, on larger displays placed in common areas with many nearby meeting spaces. The card retrieves and displays multiple meeting schedules from multiple rooms and integrates them in one single display for an integrated viewing and booking experience.

Interactivity for the Schedule Board card is currently supported on iOS, Android, Chrome OS, and LG based devices only.

Similar to the Room Schedule card (which is ideal for single room booking), the Schedule Board card is compatible with the following calendar data providers:

* **Google G Suite**
* **Microsoft Office 365**
  + Application authentication, ideal for viewing multiple rooms in organizations that do not allow user based logins, an account with administrator privileges can book all rooms in the organization.
  + User authentication, similar to the Room Schedule card authentication, an account with this permission can only book rooms that have been assigned to the user.

The Schedule Board card also includes the following features:

* **Booking options**Users have the option to book instantly or in advance, up to a maximum of four 30-minute blocks (2 hours), depending on the start of the next scheduled meeting. Similar to the Room Schedule card, users are able to check-in, extend, and end meetings, directly from the Schedule Board card.The check-in feature is enabled by default, and allows users to check-in a meeting 10 minutes before a meeting starts. The meeting auto-cancels if the meeting is not checked-in 10 minutes after the meeting starts.

* **Viewing options**At a glance, users are able to view multiple meeting rooms, and the respective meetings in a single view, allowing users to quickly identify which rooms are available or occupied. There are two viewing options available, each with its own uniqueness:
  + **Current meeting view**This simplified view of room schedules, displays only the current and next upcoming meeting, for multiple rooms. Users can also filter this view by status: Available, Check-in, Occupied.
  + **Room schedule view**This view displays a comprehensive schedule of current and all upcoming meetings for multiple rooms enabling the user to make a booking instantly, or in advance up-to three days. Users can also filter this view by status: Available, Check-in, Occupied.

* **Theme customizations**The Schedule Board card offers a variety of customization options and settings such as the default view of the card, display options, custom logo and logo positioning, custom header, interactivity, background color or image, meeting status color, and many more.

Refer to [View and manage multiple room schedules (Schedule Board card)](https://docs.appspace.com/appspace/7.1/publishing-content/basic/create-edit-publish/meeting-room/schedule-board/) for more information.
