**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `cartBox` parameter.
- The attacker would then trick a user (likely an administrator) into clicking the malicious link, which will execute the injected script when the page loads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL containing the malicious payload in the `cartBox` parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick an administrator or a user with access to the admin area into clicking the crafted URL.
