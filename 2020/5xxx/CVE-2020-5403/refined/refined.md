- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A `URISyntaxException` occurs when the Reactor Netty HTTP server encounters a malformed URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The server prematurely closes the connection instead of responding with a 400 error, leading to a denial-of-service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by sending malformed URLs, forcing the server to close connections prematurely.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted, malformed URLs to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any special privileges or access. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
