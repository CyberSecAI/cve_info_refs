### CVE-2020-5757
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the Grandstream UCM6200 series firmware. Specifically, the firmware does not properly validate the "post\_id" variable, which is obtained from a GET request parameter. This value is then directly used in an SQL query, leading to SQL injection. Also, there was a separate vulnerability concerning the lack of mitigation against OS command injection via HTTP requests. An authenticated attacker could bypass command injection mitigations and execute commands as the root user by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the UCM's "New" HTTPS API.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS command injection
- SQL injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands as root.
- An attacker can gain access to sensitive information within the WordPress database, including potentially admin password hashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted HTTP POST request to the UCM's "New" HTTPS API.
- Sending crafted HTTP GET requests with manipulated `post_id` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Grandstream UCM6200 series device.
- For the command injection, the attacker must be authenticated.
- The SQL injection can be exploited remotely and does not require authentication.
