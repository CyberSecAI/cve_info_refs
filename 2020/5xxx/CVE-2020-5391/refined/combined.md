[5.0.0](/auth0/wordpress/releases/tag/5.0.0)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/auth0/wp-auth0/compare/4.4.0...5.0.0)

Introducing V5 of WP-Auth0 ("Login by Auth0"), a major redesign and upgrade to our WordPress integration plugin. V5 includes many new features and changes:

* [WordPress 6](https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-6-0/) and [PHP 8](https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php) support
* Integration with the [Auth0-PHP SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-php), and access to its entire API (including Management API calls)
* High performance background sync using [WordPress' Cron](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/) feature
* "Flexible identifier" support, allowing users to sign in using multiple connection types without requiring extra configuration
* Expanded control over how sign ins without matching existing WordPress accounts are handled
* Enhanced session pairing between WordPress and Auth0, including session invalidation, access token refresh, and more.

V5 represents a major step forward for our WordPress plugin, and we're excited to see what you build with it!

It's important to note, if you wrote custom theme code or plugins for your WordPress site that targeted previous versions of the plugin, you may need to adjust those themes or plugins to adapt to the new version. We will be rolling this release out to the WordPress plugin store in the near future. Meanwhile, you can manually install the package using Composer using the instructions in the README.

[5.0.0 BETA1](/auth0/wordpress/releases/tag/5.0.0-BETA1)
Pre-release

Pre-release

⚠️ **Version 5.0 of our plugin is now available in Beta.** This release adds a significant number of features, and includes breaking changes. We do not recommend using this release in a production environment yet, but your feedback and testing is appreciated.

## New Features

* **PHP 8.0 Support** — The plugin has been redesigned to use PHP 8.0+ language features.
* **Flexible Connection Matching** — This allows users to sign in using multiple connections to the same account. For example, with this you can now sign in using your standard email-password, or social connections you've enabled. Any connection works so long as the authenticating account shares the same (verified) email address.
* **Absentee Account Handling** — You can now choose different behaviors for handling when a user signs in successfully, but an account doesn't exist matching the email. Although Auth0 Database Connections have always handled this well on the API side with the 'Disable Sign-Ups' toggle, social connections are trickier in cases where that option doesn't exist. You can now choose to deny those types of authentication requests, or dynamically create new accounts for those users.
* **WP-Cron support** — The plugin now leverages the WP background task scheduler to improve performance. Because real-time Management API calls can sometimes fail (rate limits, network congestion on one's hosting provider, etc.) we can now batch changes for WP customers with high traffic sites to more efficiently bring their CMS and Auth0 databases in sync.
* **Session Pairing** — WordPress sessions are not completely managed by the plugin, ensuring scenarios like token expiration and refresh tokens are honored and properly acted upon.
* **PSR-18, PSR-17 and PSR-7 Support** — All networking functions of the plugin have been rewritten to use the PHP-FIG standards for HTTP messaging. This also removes the library's dependency on Guzzle.
* **WP\_Object\_Cache support** — Caching now uses the native WP\_Object\_Cache API, for enhanced storage options through third-party plugins. In particular, this is now used for JWKS caching, enabling improved performance.

## Breaking Changes

* PHP 8.0.0 is now the minimum supported version.
* Embedded login support has been deprecated, and Universal Login is now required.
* All `auth0_` and `a0_` prefixed functions have migrated into classes beneath the `Auth0\WordPress` namespace.
* All previous JWT processing using third-party libraries has been removed. This is now handled by [Auth0's PHP SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP).
* `Auth0\WordPress\Plugin` handles the underlying [Auth0-PHP SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP) initialization and configuration.
* `Auth0\WordPress\Actions\Authentication` now handles all authentication functions, and acts as the core for the various WordPress hooks used throughout the system.
* `Auth0\WordPress\Actions\Configuration` now handles all Admin UI rendering functions. A new configuration database storage format has been established which will supersede the previous V4 method.
* `Auth0\WordPress\Actions\Sync` manages the new WP-Cron scheduled task functions.
* Sessions have been reworked to support the new Auth0 PHP SDK 8.0+ format.

Additional new features and changes may be added before this new version is released as stable.
