Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) controls on the domain field within the Auth0 WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to potentially make unauthorized changes to the plugin's domain settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes, including:
*   Altering the domain settings of the Auth0 plugin, which could redirect authentication requests to a malicious site.
*   Potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts if the attacker controls the malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is a CSRF attack, where an attacker tricks a logged-in administrator into submitting a malicious request, leading to changes to plugin settings.
*   This can be achieved by embedding a malicious form on a website that the administrator visits while logged into the WordPress admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator into visiting a malicious webpage.
*   The attacker does not require direct access to the WordPress admin panel. The attack can be carried out remotely through a web browser.
*  The attacker also needs knowledge of the plugin's domain settings form and its associated parameters.

**Additional details from content:**
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the WordPress Plugin for Auth0 up to and including 3.11.3.
*   The issue was addressed in version 4.0.0 of the plugin, along with several other vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "High" severity.
