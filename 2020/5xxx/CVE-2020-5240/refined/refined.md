Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-5240:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper permission checks in the `wagtail-2fa` application when managing 2FA devices. Specifically, users without the necessary 'change\_user' permission were able to view and delete other users' 2FA devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Inadequate Authorization:** The application failed to enforce proper access control, allowing unauthorized users to access and modify sensitive data (2FA device configurations) of other users.
- **Missing Permissions Check:** The device list and delete views were not verifying if a user had the required 'change\_user' permission before allowing them to manage other users' devices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **2FA Bypass:** By deleting another user's 2FA devices, an attacker could disable the target user's two-factor authentication.
- **Account Compromise:** If the attacker knew or could obtain the target user's password, they could then gain unauthorized access to the account without the 2FA protection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access to CMS:** An attacker with access to the Wagtail CMS interface can navigate to the device management section for other users.
- **Manipulation of URLs/Requests:** The vulnerability was exposed through the UI, as the paths were accessible without proper checks, it might have been possible to manipulate URL or requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with access to the Wagtail CMS backend.
- The attacker does not need to have any special permissions other than access to the CMS itself.

**Additional Details:**
- This issue was addressed in `wagtail-2fa` version 1.4.1.
- The fix involved adding a permission check on the device list and delete views to ensure that only users with 'change\_user' permission or the user who owns the devices can manage them.
- The provided commit (`ac23550d33b7436e90e3beea904647907eba5b74`) demonstrates the code changes that were made to fix the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was present in versions prior to 1.4.0.
- This issue is also referenced by GHSA-9gjv-6qq6-v7qm.

This vulnerability allowed for a straightforward bypass of 2FA for users and would have had significant impact.
