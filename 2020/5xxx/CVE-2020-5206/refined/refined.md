Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-5206:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how Opencast handles remember-me cookies in conjunction with anonymous access. When a remember-me cookie is present (even if invalid), Opencast populates the user context. In endpoints that allow anonymous access, the system incorrectly assumes proper authentication based on the populated user context, even when the actual authentication is anonymous.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core vulnerability is an authentication bypass. An attacker can circumvent proper authentication procedures.
- **Insufficient Validation:** The security service fails to verify if the user in the request context is actually authenticated or is merely the result of an invalid remember-me token.
- **Flawed Logic:** The logic incorrectly assumes authentication based solely on the presence of a user in the context, without checking the actual authentication type (anonymous vs. authenticated).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By creating a fake remember-me token, an attacker can impersonate a user, including a global system administrator.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to non-public content from the search service without any valid credentials.
- **Data Exposure:** Sensitive content can be exposed to unauthorized users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Forged Remember-Me Cookie:** An attacker forges a remember-me cookie containing an arbitrary username.
- **Anonymous Access Endpoint:** The attacker targets an endpoint that allows anonymous access.
- **Exploitation:** The system incorrectly grants access based on the forged cookie, bypassing authentication checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Opencast:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoints and how remember-me cookies are handled.
- **Ability to Forge Cookie:** The attacker must have the means to generate or manipulate a remember-me cookie.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to send requests to the target Opencast system.
