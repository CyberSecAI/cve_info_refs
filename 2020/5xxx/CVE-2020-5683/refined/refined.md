Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5683:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by **improper verification of uploaded files**, leading to a directory traversal issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the file paths of uploaded files, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path to access or modify files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   When a specially crafted file is uploaded, data in the product may be altered.
*   An attacker could potentially overwrite or create files in arbitrary locations within the server's filesystem where the application has write permissions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
*   The attacker would upload a specially crafted file, which contains a malicious file path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No privileges required:** An attacker does not need any special privileges or access to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction: Required:** The attacker needs user interaction to trigger the vulnerability by having a user upload the malicious file.

**CVSS Metrics:**

*   **CVSS v3:** 4.3 (Medium)
    *   AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
    *   Attack Vector: Network, Attack Complexity: Low, Privileges Required: None, User Interaction: Required, Scope: Unchanged, Confidentiality Impact: None, Integrity Impact: Low, Availability Impact: None
*   **CVSS v2:** 4.3 (Medium)
    *   AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N
    *   Access Vector: Network, Access Complexity: Medium, Authentication: None, Confidentiality Impact: None, Integrity Impact: Partial, Availability Impact: None

**Affected Products:**

*   GROWI versions prior to v4.2.3 (v4.2 Series)
*   GROWI versions prior to v4.1.12 (v4.1 Series)
*   GROWI v3 series and earlier

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to a patched version of GROWI (v4.2.3 or later for v4.2 series and v4.1.12 or later for v4.1 series).
*   The vendor recommends upgrading to the v4.2 series because v3 and earlier are end-of-support.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Daisuke Takahashi of CyberAgent, Inc.
*   This vulnerability is related to file uploads, where path traversal can be achieved by manipulating the filename in the upload.

This analysis provides more detail than the basic CVE description by outlining the specific weakness (path traversal), the attack vector (file upload), and the potential for data alteration.
