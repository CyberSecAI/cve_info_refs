{
  "CVE-2020-5789": {
    "Description": "Relative Path Traversal in Teltonika firmware TRB2_R_00.02.04.3 allows a remote, authenticated attacker to read the contents of arbitrary files on disk.",
    "Root cause": "The `download_certificate` function in `/usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/administration.lua` does not validate the `file` parameter, allowing path traversal.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated attacker can read the contents of arbitrary files on the device as root, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
    "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to `/cgi-bin/luci/admin/system/admin/certificates/export` with a crafted `file` parameter.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker must have low-privileged access to the device (user group)."
  }
