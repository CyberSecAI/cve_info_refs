Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-5427:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization when handling sorting parameters in task execution requests. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, specifically through the `sort` parameter within the Task Execution sorting query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially manipulate the SQL query, leading to unauthorized access to the database, data breaches, modification of data, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through manipulating the `sort` query parameter in the HTTP request when retrieving task execution information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the Spring Cloud Data Flow application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker would need to identify a way to inject malicious SQL code through the `sort` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected versions of Spring Cloud Data Flow include 2.6.x prior to 2.6.5 and 2.5.x prior to 2.5.4.
- The vulnerability was fixed in versions 2.7.0, 2.6.5, and 2.5.4.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Sufijen Bani from CHECK24 Factory GmbH.
