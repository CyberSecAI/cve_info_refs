    -  Session hijacking
    -  Data theft
    -  Malware distribution
    -  Defacement

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires user interaction (victim has to view/interact with a crafted email) to trigger the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication required:** The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to initiate the attack.
- **Crafted Input:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious email or manipulate input within the email application to inject the malicious script.
- **Victim's Browser:** The victim must access the email using a web browser running vulnerable versions of Cybozu Garoon.
