Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-5231

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an overly permissive access control configuration in Opencast. Specifically, the `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` role, intended for managing specific courses, was incorrectly granted the ability to create new users via the user-utils endpoint. This role was not intended to be able to create users, and was not documented.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` was granted excessive privileges, allowing user creation despite not being intended for this purpose.
- **Undocumented Role:** The `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` was not officially documented, making its unexpected behavior even harder to detect.
- **Inconsistent Role Usage:** The `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` was not used in code except for tests and security configuration leading to unexpected behaviour.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` privileges could create new user accounts with the same role, allowing them to expand the scope of their administrative control.
- An attacker could potentially create numerous accounts, which could be used for malicious purposes, leading to potential denial-of-service or other attacks.
- The attacker could use these accounts to bypass security measures or perform actions they are not authorized to perform within the Opencast system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to gain access to an account with the `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` role. This could be achieved through compromised credentials, social engineering, or exploitation of other vulnerabilities.
- Once logged in, the attacker could then use the `/user-utils` endpoint to create additional user accounts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid credentials for a user account with the `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` role within the Opencast system.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `/user-utils` endpoint of the Opencast application.

**Additional Details:**

The provided content includes a commit that addresses the vulnerability by removing the default access rules for the `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN`. This ensures that this role cannot be used to create new users by default.  The fix is present in version 7.6 and 8.1. The advisory also suggests a workaround for systems that haven't been patched yet which is to remove `ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN` from the security configuration.
