Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2020-5808:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an access control issue in the Automatic Distribution configuration of Tenable.sc.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is related to improper access control in how scanners are used within defined scan zones.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A scanner could potentially be used outside of the user's defined scan zone, if a scan does not explicitly specify a zone, allowing unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data. This could lead to unauthorized information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves the configuration of automatic scanner distribution in Tenable.sc, where an attacker could potentially exploit this issue to initiate scans outside of a specified scan zone.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to configure scans within Tenable.sc. They need not be in a privileged position, as an unprivileged user can potentially exploit this weakness if they have scan creation privileges.

**Additional details:**

- The issue is resolved in Tenable.sc version 5.17.0.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 7.5 which reflects high severity, as an attacker can gain unauthorized access to scan data outside of their defined zones.
