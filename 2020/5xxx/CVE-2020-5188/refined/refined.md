{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the DNN (DotNetNuke) file upload module where client-side validation is the only check for normal users' file uploads.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient server-side validation for file uploads",
      "Client-side validation bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "A normal user can bypass the client-side validation and upload files with extensions that are normally only allowed for superusers. This can lead to various exploits, including the potential to leverage other vulnerabilities, such as the Zip Slip vulnerability, or upload malicious code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Browser's console execution of javascript",
      "Proxy tools such as Burp or ZAP"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A normal (low privileged) user account is needed. The attacker needs to be able to modify the request either via browser developer tools or using a proxy."
