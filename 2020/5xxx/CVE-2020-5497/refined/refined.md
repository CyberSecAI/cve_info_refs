Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-5497

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to unsanitized user input being included in HTML and JavaScript code, specifically in the `header.tag` and `topbar.tag` files of the MITREid Connect OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User-controlled data is directly inserted into HTML and JavaScript contexts without proper sanitization. Specifically, the user's name is included in a JSON object within a `<script>` tag and as part of a link in the navigation bar.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or encode the user's name before embedding it into the HTML and JavaScript code, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the user's name field, which will then be executed in the context of other users' browsers.
- **Session Hijacking:** While not explicitly mentioned in detail, XSS can be used to steal cookies and potentially hijack user sessions.
- **Client-Side Logic Manipulation:** The attacker could manipulate client-side logic, such as the `isAdmin` check, to gain unauthorized access to admin functions or other restricted resources, although the impact of this was limited to client-side access without sensitive data modification.
- **Page Defacement:** The attacker can alter the appearance of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Profile Manipulation:** An attacker can change their own name through the application's interface to include malicious JavaScript code.
- **Infected User Browsing:** When other users view the application's pages (e.g. `header.tag`, `topbar.tag`) that include the infected user's name, the malicious script is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account on the MITREid Connect application to modify their user profile information.
- **No Special Privileges Needed**: The attack does not require any special user privileges or administrative access.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs because the user's name is included in a JSON object used by the JavaScript `getUserInfo()` function in `header.tag`, and in the HTML of the navigation menu generated by `topbar.tag`.
- An example payload used to demonstrate the vulnerability is: `Test</script><script>alert(1)</script>`, which closes the existing `<script>` element and starts a new one containing the malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The identified issue was reported on Github and assigned CVE-2020-5497.
- A write-up of the vulnerability was made available on a Security Metrics blog.
