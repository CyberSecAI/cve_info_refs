# CVE-2020-5497 - MITREid Connect XSS

---

*From*: aaron bishop <abishop () linux com>

*Date*: Fri, 21 Feb 2020 13:45:51 -0700

---

```
MITREid Connect OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server
<<https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server>> version
1.3.3 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting; the users name is
included in *topbar.tag* and *header.tag* without being sanitized.  A user
can set their name to a value like:

Test</script><script>alert(1)</script>

Which will be included in JSON used by a JavaScript function in *header.tag*
:

// get the info of the current user, if available (null otherwise)

```
> ```
>     function getUserInfo() {
>         return {"sub":"12318767","name":"
> *Test</script><script>alert(1)</script>*
> Test","preferred_username":"Test","given_name":"Test</script><script>alert(1)</script>","family_name":"Test","email":"
> test () test com","email_verified":true};}
>
> ```

```

A name such as:

Test<script>alert(1)</script>

would also work; it is included in the page when menus are created by
*topbar.tag*:

<!-- use a simplified user button system when collapsed -->

```
> ```
> <ul class="nav hidden-desktop">
> <li><a href="manage/#user/profile">*Test<script>alert(1)</script>*
> Test</a></li>
> <li class="divider"></li>
> <li><a href="" class="logoutLink"><i class="icon-remove"></i> Log
> out</a></li>
>
> ```

```

This issue has been reported on Github
<<https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server/issues/1521>>
with
patches pending.

CVE-2020-5497 - MITREid Connect Cross-site Scripting

# CVE-2020-5497 - MITREid Connect Cross-site Scripting

**Author:**Aaron Bishop

# 'Alert' - Here be cross-site scripting

Here's the situation: I was performing a penetration test that integrated with **MITREid Connect** for authorization. I transitioned from the Customers Web Application to the **MITREid Connect** web interface and was greeted by:

![](https://ix-cdn.b2e5.com/images/32040/32040_4e2053276f0a45969261355d9d1037c6_1582131222.png)

If you've been through some sort of web application security assessment the above image may look familiar, a JavaScript `alert`. It is commonly used by penetration testers to identify potential [Cross-site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) because it is easy, visible, and demonstrates that the analyst was able to get the Application to execute arbitrary JavaScript.

I modified my username to be `Test</script><script>alert(2)</script>`. If my username was included in a `<script>` element, my username would close that `<script>` element and a new `<script>` element that triggers an `alert` would be created.

It just so happens, my username was included in the page, unsanitized, in a `<script>` element that performed several function calls including `getUserInfo`:

```
// get the info of the current user, if available (null otherwise)
function getUserInfo() {
    return {"sub":"1234567890","name":"Test</script><script>alert(2)</script>","preferred_username":"Test","given_name":"Test</script><script>alert(2)</script>","family_name":"test","email":"test@test.com","email_verified":true};
}

```

My username was also included later in the page, outside a `<script>` element:

```
<li><a href="manage/#user/profile">Test</script><script>alert(2)</script> Test</a></li>
<li class="divider"></li>
<li><a href="" class="logoutLink"><i class="icon-remove"></i> Log out</a></li>

```

The username appears outside a `<script>` element so a closing `</script>` is unnecessary and will essentially be ignored by the browser; my username created a new `<script>` element which I controlled.

I noticed the Cross-site Scripting occurs before several **js** files are referenced:

```
193<li><a href="manage/#user/profile">Test</script><script>alert(2)</script> Test</a></li>
194<li class="divider"></li>
195<li><a href="" class="logoutLink"><i class="icon-remove"></i> Log out</a></li>
...
322<script type="text/javascript" src="resources/js/client.js" ></script>
323
324<script type="text/javascript" src="resources/js/grant.js" ></script>
325
326<script type="text/javascript" src="resources/js/scope.js" ></script>
327
328<script type="text/javascript" src="resources/js/whitelist.js" ></script>
329
330<script type="text/javascript" src="resources/js/dynreg.js" ></script>
331
332<script type="text/javascript" src="resources/js/rsreg.js" ></script>
333
334<script type="text/javascript" src="resources/js/token.js" ></script>
335
336<script type="text/javascript" src="resources/js/blacklist.js" ></script>
337
338<script type="text/javascript" src="resources/js/profile.js" ></script>
339
340<script type="text/javascript" src="resources/js/admin.js"></script>

```

Some files, like **admin.js**, perform a check to see if the `isAdmin` function returns **true** before granting access to restricted pages:

```
root: function() {
    if (isAdmin()) {
        this.navigate('admin/clients', {
            trigger: true
        });
    } else {
        this.navigate('user/approved', {
            trigger: true
        });
    }
}

```

I exploited the Cross-site Scripting to force `isAdmin` to return `true` and grant other roles to my user:

![](https://ix-cdn.b2e5.com/images/32040/32040_6ba15d7081df4c6d961b699b9660b3d4_1582131370.png)

Previously restricted pages were accessible, however, no sensitive information was disclosed and I was unable to modify the application after bypassing the client-side `isAdmin` check.

**MITREid Connect** is an open-source project available on [github](https://github.com/mitreid-connect) so I cloned the project and set about tracking down the cause. The search led to two places where information a user can alter is included in the page, the first being in `header.tag`:

```
// get the info of the current user, if available (null otherwise)
function getUserInfo() {
    return ${userInfoJson};
}

```

The second in `topbar.tag`:

```
<li><a href="manage/#user/profile">${ longName }</a></li>
<li class="divider"></li>
<li><a href="" class="logoutLink"><i class="icon-remove"></i> <spring:message code="topbar.logout"/></a></li>

```

I reported the [issue](https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server/issues/1521) which has subsequently been assigned [CVE-2020-5497](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5497).

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

```

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# Fulldisclosure -- Improving network security through full disclosure

## About Fulldisclosure

The Full Disclosure mailing list is a public forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. FD differs from other security lists in its open nature and support for researchers' right to decide how to disclose their own discovered bugs. The [full disclosure movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_%28computer_security%29) has been credited with forcing vendors to better secure their products and to publicly acknowledge and fix flaws rather than hide them. Vendor legal intimidation and censorship attempts are not tolerated here!

This list is meant as a spiritual successor to the [grok.org.uk Full-Disclosure list](http://lists.grok.org.uk/full-disclosure-charter.html) started by Len Rose and John Cartwright in 2002 and [terminated abruptly in March 2014](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Mar/332) due to bogus legal threats. We are giving this list a fresh start, so members of the old list need to resubscribe here.

This list is run by and for the network security community. Moderation is performed by a team of volunteers using our [moderation guidelines](https://secwiki.org/w/FD_Moderation). Time is truly of the essence in vulnerability disclosure, so we try to keep the moderation delay short. When we need more moderators we will recruit from the most active and insightful list members.

You must join the list before you can post to it. Submit posts to fulldisclosure@seclists.org. If you don't want list message delivery to the address you post from, you can disable it in [list config](https://nmap.org/mailman/options/fulldisclosure).

Posts are publicly archived at the [Seclists.org Full Disclosure web archive](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure) and the list RSS feed is available there too. Various unofficial archives exist as well. You can prevent archiving (at least for Seclists) by specifying the [X-No-Archive mail header](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-No-Archive) in your post, but you might reconsider whether to post such a sensitive message to a public list in the first place.

Given the light moderation policy and that we generally don't verify posted information, and that email forgery is easy, deal with all list content at your own risk! In particular, running any "exploit scripts" or executables posted to this list can be disastrous.

## Using Fulldisclosure

To post a message to all the list members, send email to
fulldisclosure@seclists.org.

You can subscribe to the list, or change your existing
subscription, in the sections below.

![@irbishop](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161021?v=4&size=48)[irbishop](https://github.com/irbishop)opened [on Jan 3, 2020](https://github.com/mitreid-connect/OpenID-Connect-Java-Spring-Server/issues/1521#issue-545116200)

`header.tag` appears to be vulnerable to XSS here:

```
		// get the info of the current user, if available (null otherwise)
    	function getUserInfo() {
    		return ${userInfoJson};
    	}

```

**userInfoJson** is included in the page and is not encoded so malicious elements could be created. If the string `</script>` appears in **userInfoJson**, the `<script>` element will be closed

and a new malicious `<script>` can be created:

```
        // get the info of the current user, if available (null otherwise)
    	function getUserInfo() {
    		return {"sub":"12318767","name":"Test</script><script>alert(1)</script> Test","preferred_username":"Test","given_name":"Test</script><script>alert(1)</script>","family_name":"Test","email":"test@test.com","email_verified":true};
    	}

```

And the malicious JavaScript is executed:
