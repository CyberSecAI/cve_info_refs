# JVNVU#91553662 Denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in Mitsubishi Electric MELSOFT transmission port

## Overview

MELSOFT transmission port (UDP/IP) of multiple Mistsubishi Electric MELSEC series contains a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability due to the uncontrolled resource consumption ([CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)) isssue.

## Products Affected

The units with MELSOFT transmission port (UDP/ID) on Ethernet port embedded in Mitsubishi Electric MELSEC series are affected:

* MELSEC iQ-R series (all versions)
* MELSEC iQ-F series (all versions)
* MELSEC Q series (all versions)
* MELSEC L series (all versions)
* MELSEC F series (all versions)

## Description

MELSOFT transmission port (UDP/IP) of MELSEC iQ-Rï¼iQ-Fï¼Qï¼L, and F series provided by Mitsubishi Electric Coporation contains an uncontrolled resource consumption issue ([CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)).   When MELSOFT transmission port receives massive amount of data, resource consumption occurs and the port does not process the data properly.  As a result, it may fall into a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

## Impact

When MELSOFT transmission port does not process data properly, a client becomes unable to communicate with MELSOFT transmission port.  Also, the other devices which communicate using the other communication port may become unable to connect to MELSOFT transmission port.

According to the developer, this vulnerability only affects Ethernet communication functions.

## Solution

**Apply Workarounds**

The developer states that this vulnerability does not affect sequential controls, and when a denial-of-service (DoS) condition is ended, the communication functions become to behave properly.  Therefore there is no plan to provide any updates or patches to address to this issue.

However, according to the developer, applying the workaround listed below may mitigate the impacts of this vulnerability.

* Set up Firewall and restrict access from the devices via network
* Use IP address filter function and restrict IP addresses which can be connected to

For the details of the mitigations, refer to the information provided by the developer.

Remote Access Vulnerability in MELSOFT Transmission Port (UDP/IP)
March 30, 2020
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation

■Overview

Mitsubishi Electric is aware of a vulnerability of Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) in MELSOFT transmission port
(UDP/IP) of MELSEC iQ-R, iQ-F, Q, L and F series programmable controllers. When an attacker sends a large amount of data
to the MELSOFT transmission port (UDP/IP) of the applicable product, the MELSOFT transmission port (UDP/IP) may enter an
unprocessable condition.

■Affected products

All versions of MELSEC iQ-R，iQ-F，Q，L and F series programmable controllers with MELSOFT transmission port (UDP/IP) in
Ethernet port are affected.

■Description

There is a vulnerability of Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) in MELSOFT transmission port (UDP/IP) of MELSEC
iQ-R, iQ-F, Q, L and F series programmable controllers provided by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation.

■Impact

When the MELSOFT transmission port enters an unprocessable condition, authorized clients cannot connect to the MELSOFT
transmission port, and devices communicating on other transmission ports are difficult to connect. In addition, this vulnerability
will not affect functions other than Ethernet communication.

■Mitigations

For unauthorized access from external devices via the Internet, as a warning described in [Design Precautions] given in user's
manuals*1, when it is necessary to maintain the safety of the programmable controller system, take measures such as installing
a firewall.
*1 E.g. MELSEC iQ-R Ethernet User's Manual (Application)
Moreover, damage caused by this vulnerability can be mitigated or prevented by implementing either or a combination of the
following methods.
(1) Install a firewall.
(2) Use the IP filter function to restrict the connectable IP addresses.

■Acknowledgements

Mitsubishi Electric would like to thank Rongkuan Ma, Jie Meng and Peng Cheng who reported this vulnerability.
