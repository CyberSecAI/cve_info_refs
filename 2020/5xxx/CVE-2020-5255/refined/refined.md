Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from Symfony's behavior of falling back to the `Accept` header of a request to determine the `Content-Type` of a response when the response does not explicitly set a `Content-Type` header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Content-Type Determination:** Symfony was using the `Accept` header to guess the `Content-Type` of the response. This could lead to a mismatch between the actual content of the response and the `Content-Type` header set.
- **Cache Poisoning:** When the response was cached, the incorrect `Content-Type` could be stored, leading to a corrupted cache where the cached format is not the correct one. This is known as cache poisoning.
- **Dependency on Accept Header:** The `Content-Type` of the response should be explicitly set, not determined by the `Accept` header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cache Corruption:** A malicious actor could manipulate the `Accept` header in a request to cause a server to cache a response with an incorrect `Content-Type`. This could lead to various issues for clients receiving the response, depending on their ability to parse the content based on the wrong `Content-Type` header.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation**: Depending on the specific use-case and how an application handles responses, this cache poisoning could potentially be used as a step in a more complex attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack can be performed over the network by sending a crafted HTTP request with a manipulated `Accept` header.
- **HTTP Request Header Manipulation**: The attacker manipulates the `Accept` header of an HTTP request to influence the `Content-Type` of the cached response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
- **Understanding of HTTP Headers:** The attacker needs to know how to manipulate the `Accept` header.
- **Ability to Trigger Caching**: The attacker needs to be able to trigger caching of the response

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Symfony versions 4.4.0 to 4.4.6 and 5.0.0 to 5.0.6.
- The fix involves Symfony no longer using the `Accept` header to guess the `Content-Type`, instead requiring it to be set explicitly.
- Patched versions are 4.4.7 and 5.0.7.
- The issue is considered low severity.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-435 which is "Improper Handling of Insufficiently-Resourced Data".
