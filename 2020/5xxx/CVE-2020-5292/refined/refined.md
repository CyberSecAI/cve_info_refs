Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5292:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the "users" parameter, when constructing a SQL query in the `class.tickets.php` file. The code directly used the unsanitized input in an `IN` clause, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authenticated Blind SQL Injection:** The core weakness is the lack of input sanitization, specifically when handling the "users" parameter within the `getAllBySearchCriteria` function in the `class.tickets.php`. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands. The vulnerability is considered blind because the application does not directly display SQL errors, but an attacker can infer the results of the injected SQL through timing or other side-channel information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **High impact:** An attacker could exploit this to perform malicious actions against the database, including:
    - **Data Exfiltration:** Extract sensitive information such as user credentials (password hashes), and other confidential data.
    - **Data Modification:** Alter or corrupt existing data within the database.
    - **Denial of Service:** Potentially drop or modify database tables, leading to service disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted POST request to `/tickets/showKanban` with a valid session, including a malicious payload in the "users" parameter.
- **SQL Injection via IN clause:** The unsanitized "users" parameter is directly used within an SQL "IN" clause, allowing the attacker to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user with an authenticated session to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability does not affect unauthenticated users.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know that the "users" parameter in the specified POST request is vulnerable.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was patched by introducing a new static function in the `db` class that creates a binding string for use in PDO queries with `IN` clauses, and iterating over the users filter array to match the binding string. This fixes the injection.
- The affected versions include all versions <= 2.0.14 and 2.1-beta2, while the patched versions are 2.0.15 and 2.1-beta3.
- The commit `af0807f0b2c4c3c914b93f1c5d940e6b875f231f` includes the code changes that fix the SQL injection vulnerability.
