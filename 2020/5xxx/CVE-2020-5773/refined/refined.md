Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-5773:

**CVE-2020-5773: Insufficient Access Control**

*   **Root Cause:** The Teltonika TRB245 firmware has insufficient access control, allowing users in the 'user' group, which is supposed to have no write access, to make unauthorized changes to the device.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Users in the 'user' group can perform write operations, which they are not supposed to be able to do.
    *   Specifically, the 'user' group can exploit other vulnerabilities like the ones related to backup archive upload (CVE-2020-5771) and package upload (CVE-2020-5772).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A low-privileged user can make changes, some of which can fully compromise the system, due to the ability to exploit other vulnerabilities. For example, they can achieve root privileges by installing backdoored packages or uploading backdoored backup archives.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A low-privileged user logged into the web interface of the device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have valid credentials for a 'user' account on the Teltonika TRB245 device.
    *   Network access to the web interface of the device.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Teltonika firmware TRB2\_R\_00.02.04.01.
*   The vendor released a fix in version TRB2XX\_R\_00.02.04.3.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Derrie Sutton of Tenable.
