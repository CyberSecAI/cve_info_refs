Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-5274:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `ErrorHandler` in Symfony was rendering exception HTML pages using unescaped properties from the related Exception class. This allowed for potential injection of malicious code or unintended data exposure if an attacker could influence the content of exception properties. Also, stack traces were being displayed in non-debug environments, which could leak sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of output escaping:** The primary weakness was the failure to properly escape exception properties before rendering them in the HTML output. This lack of sanitization could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Displaying stack traces in non-debug environments exposed potentially sensitive internal application details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the exception messages or properties. These scripts would then be executed in the browsers of users who viewed the error pages.
*   **Information Leakage:** Exposure of the stack trace in non-debug environments could leak internal application details, potentially assisting further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector involves an attacker being able to influence the content of the Exception object, specifically its properties and message. This could be achieved in a variety of ways depending on the application logic, such as:
*   By injecting specific data through user inputs which cause exceptions to be thrown.
*   By exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application that allow manipulation of exception messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs a way to trigger an exception with crafted, malicious data in its properties/message within the application.
*   The attacker would need to have the error page rendered (usually by triggering an error condition in the app).

**Additional Details from the provided content**

*   **Affected Versions:** Symfony versions >=4.4.0 and <4.4.4, as well as >=5.0.0 and <5.0.4, are affected.
*   **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is resolved in Symfony versions 4.4.4 and 5.0.4.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves two key changes:
    1.  Escaping all properties coming from the related Exception before rendering it in HTML.
    2.  Disabling the display of stack traces in non-debug environments.
*   **Patches:** Specific commits that address the issue are:
    *   `cf80224589ac05402d4f72f5ddf80900ec94d5ad`: Introduces a `debug` argument to control whether debug pages should be shown.
    *   `629d21b800a15dc649fb0ae9ed7cd9211e7e45db`: Implements escaping of variables within the exception template.

In summary, CVE-2020-5274 is a moderate severity vulnerability in Symfony that stemmed from inadequate output escaping in error handling, potentially leading to XSS and information disclosure. Patches have been released to address these issues by adding proper escaping and controlling stack trace visibility.
