Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5415:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the GitLab authentication connector in Concourse using a user's full name instead of their username for identification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Identity Spoofing:** The primary weakness is that an attacker can create a GitLab account with the same full name as a legitimate user who has access to a Concourse team. This allows the attacker to impersonate the legitimate user.
- **Insecure Authentication Logic:** The authentication process relies on the full name, which is not a unique identifier, instead of the username, which is. This makes the system vulnerable to impersonation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to Concourse teams and resources, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious activities.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By impersonating a user with higher privileges, an attacker can potentially escalate their access and perform actions they wouldn't normally be able to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Account Creation:** The attacker needs to create a GitLab account with the same full name as a legitimate Concourse user.
- **Authentication:** The attacker then uses their newly created GitLab account to authenticate with Concourse. If the Concourse team has granted access based on the full name, then the attacker will gain access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a GitLab account.
- The attacker must know the full name of a legitimate user with access to a Concourse team.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Concourse versions prior to 6.3.1 when using the GitLab auth connector.
- The fix involves changing the GitLab connector to use the username instead of the full name for authentication.
- A workaround is to use GitLab groups instead of individual users for granting access to Concourse teams.
- The vulnerability was initially reported as a bug prior to being reported as a security issue.
