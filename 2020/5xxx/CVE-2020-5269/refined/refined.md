Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability introduced by a previous pull request ([#14721](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/14721)).
- The vulnerability occurs because the `id_feature` parameter in the URL of the `AdminFeatures` page is not properly sanitized or escaped before being used within the page's HTML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Reflected XSS: The application reflects unsanitized user input back to the user, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `AdminFeatures` page.
- This could potentially lead to:
  - Stealing user session cookies, allowing for account hijacking.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the page's content.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.

**Attack vectors:**

- A malicious link containing a crafted `id_feature` parameter is sent to a PrestaShop administrator.
- The administrator clicks the malicious link, which then executes the injected script within their browser session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the injected XSS payload.
- The attacker must be able to trick an administrator into clicking on the link. This could be done via phishing, social engineering, or other methods.
- No other privileged access is required.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in PrestaShop version 1.7.6.1
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.6.5
- The fix involves properly escaping or sanitizing the `id_feature` parameter.
- The provided commit diff highlights changes in `list_content.tpl` to ensure that the `tr.link` variable is properly escaped for HTML, preventing injection.
- The commit diff also shows changes to `AdminFeaturesController.php` to cast the `id_feature` parameter to an integer, which prevents injection.
