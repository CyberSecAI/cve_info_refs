Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The NITORI App uses a Custom URL Scheme to access requested URLs.
*   The app has an improper access control vulnerability which allows it to receive requests from arbitrary apps and execute the access without proper restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The app does not properly restrict which applications can send it URL access requests. This is a vulnerability related to permissions (CWE-264)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker can cause the app to open an arbitrary website.
*   This can lead to phishing attacks, where a user is tricked into entering their credentials or sensitive information on a malicious website disguised as a legitimate one.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker can send malicious crafted URLs that when opened by the user, will be passed to the vulnerable app.
*   The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a crafted link, which will then trigger the vulnerable app.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that will be passed to the vulnerable app.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick the user into clicking this link.

**Affected Products:**

*   NITORI App for Android versions 6.0.4 and earlier
*   NITORI App for iOS versions 6.0.2 and earlier
