Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the App Autoscaler component within VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs logging sensitive credentials. Specifically, it logs the UAA admin password and the App Autoscaler Broker password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Credential Logging:** The core vulnerability is the logging of sensitive passwords in plain text within application logs.
- **Insufficient Redaction:** While the UAA admin password is redacted in VMware Tanzu Operations Manager, it is not redacted in the BOSH Director logs, making it accessible to authenticated BOSH users. The App Autoscaler Broker password was also not redacted in older versions of Operations Manager.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The exposure of these credentials allows a malicious actor to gain administrative privileges and manage App Autoscaler services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Administrative Access:** Exploitation of the logged UAA admin password grants an attacker administrative privileges to the system.
- **Service Management:** Exploitation of the logged App Autoscaler Broker password allows an attacker to create, delete, and modify App Autoscaler service instances.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of sensitive passwords compromises the confidentiality of these credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Log Access:** An attacker needs access to the BOSH Director logs to find the unredacted UAA admin password.
- **Service Creation/Modification:** The App Autoscaler Broker password can be leveraged to create, delete, or modify service instances.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the BOSH Director to access the logs and the unredacted UAA password.
- **Foundation Administrator/Operator:** The logs are typically only visible to foundation administrators and operators. Therefore, an attacker would need to compromise such an account to leverage the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs versions 2.7.x prior to 2.7.19, 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.13, and 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7.
- Operations Manager versions prior to 2.7.15, 2.8.6, and 2.9.1 did not redact the App Autoscaler Broker password in logs.
- The issue is considered a medium severity vulnerability.
