Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-5230:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Opencast's allowance of almost arbitrary identifiers for media packages and elements. These identifiers are sometimes used in file system operations, which can lead to security issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe file system operations: The use of arbitrary identifiers in file system operations could allow attackers to escape working directories and write files to arbitrary locations.
- Identifier mismatch: Inconsistent behavior between `Id.toString(…)` and `Id.compact(…)` could result in identifier mismatches, where the latter attempts to mitigate some of the file system issues but can unintentionally alter the identifier.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file write: An attacker could manipulate identifiers to write files to locations outside the intended working directory.

**Attack vectors:**
- Manipulating identifiers: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting media package or element identifiers that include characters or sequences that allow for directory traversal or other unsafe file system operations when these identifiers are used to create file system paths.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position where they can influence the identifiers for media packages or elements that are processed by Opencast. This likely means having the ability to upload content with crafted identifiers or otherwise modify identifiers that Opencast uses.
