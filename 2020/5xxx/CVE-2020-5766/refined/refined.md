Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-5766:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `srs_simple_hits_counter` function. Specifically, the `post_id` variable, obtained directly from the GET request, is not validated before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (Blind):** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `post_id` parameter, leading to a blind SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the WordPress database, such as admin password hashes. This is a serious security risk, as it can lead to unauthorized access to the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted GET request containing malicious SQL code within the `post_id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:** The attacker does not need to have any prior access or login credentials to exploit the vulnerability, they only need to send a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable web server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `srs_simple_hits_counter` function, specifically in how the `post_id` variable is used to construct an SQL query in `update_views_visitors` function.
- The vulnerability was found in versions 1.0.3 and 1.0.4 of the SRS Simple Hits Counter plugin for WordPress.
- A proof of concept script (`blind_sqli_tra_2020_42.py`) was created to demonstrate the vulnerability by retrieving the admin password hash.
- The vulnerability was initially reported to the WordPress plugin team, but was later addressed by the Tenable security research team.
- The recommended solution is to upgrade to version 1.1.0 of the plugin, which fixes the SQL injection vulnerability.
