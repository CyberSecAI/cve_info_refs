CVE-2020-5419

### Severity

Medium

### Vendor

VMware

### Description

RabbitMQ all versions prior to 3.7.28 and 3.8.x versions prior to 3.8.7 are prone to a Windows-specific binary planting security vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution. An attacker with write privileges to the RabbitMQ installation directory and local access on Windows could carry out a local binary hijacking (planting) attack and execute arbitrary code. VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ products are not impacted as they don't use the Windows version of RabbitMQ.

  + All versions prior to v3.7.28
  + 3.8.x versions prior to v3.8.7
