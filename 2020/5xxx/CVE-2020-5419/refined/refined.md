Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5419:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Windows-specific binary planting issue in RabbitMQ.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local Binary Hijacking (Planting):** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by placing a malicious binary in the RabbitMQ installation directory.
*   This is due to a weakness in how RabbitMQ handles binary loading or execution on Windows systems, allowing it to load and execute the attacker-controlled binary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the RabbitMQ process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the Windows system where RabbitMQ is installed.
*   **Write Privileges:** The attacker must possess write permissions to the RabbitMQ installation directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have local access to the target Windows system.
*   The attacker must have write privileges to the RabbitMQ installation directory.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects RabbitMQ versions prior to 3.7.28 and 3.8.x versions prior to 3.8.7.
*   The vulnerability is specific to the Windows platform.
*   VMware Tanzu RabbitMQ products are **not** impacted as they do not use the Windows version of RabbitMQ.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Ofir Hamam and Tomer Hadad at Ernst & Young's Hacktics Advanced Security Center.
*   Patches were released in RabbitMQ versions 3.7.28 and 3.8.7.
