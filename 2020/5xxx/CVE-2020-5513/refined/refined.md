```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper input sanitization when handling the 't' parameter in the `/cm/delete` endpoint, allowing for arbitrary file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server. By uploading a malicious PHP file (disguised as an image) and then including it via the LFI vulnerability, the attacker can achieve remote code execution (RCE).",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to the `/cm/delete` endpoint, specifically by manipulating the 't' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the GilaCMS admin panel and requires the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using Burp Suite)."
