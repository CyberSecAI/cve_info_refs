Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-5251

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of regular expressions (regex) in user input when processing session tokens, email verification tokens, and password reset tokens. Instead of treating these tokens as exact string matches, the application was allowing them to be interpreted as regex patterns within database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Regex Injection:** The primary vulnerability is regex injection, where an attacker can inject regex patterns into parameters intended for string matching. This is particularly dangerous when used in database queries, allowing attackers to bypass authentication checks, retrieve information they should not have access to, and potentially modify data.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The system fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input before using it in database queries. This lack of validation allows the injection of regex patterns.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Session Token Bypass:** Attackers can bypass session token checks using a regex, allowing them to impersonate other users.
*  **Account Takeover:** Attackers can verify emails using regex, and reset passwords using regex on password reset tokens, and potentially take over accounts if they can also guess the username.
*   **Data Retrieval:** Attackers could potentially retrieve all user objects by crafting regex queries to bypass normal user lookups.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts without needing valid, complete tokens.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Requests:** By sending specially crafted POST requests with a regex pattern in place of the session token.
*   **HTTP GET Requests:** By sending GET requests with a regex pattern in the token parameter of the verify email or reset password URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of API:** The attacker must know how the API expects session tokens, email verification tokens, and password reset tokens to be provided.
*   **Ability to Craft Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests to inject regex patterns into the parameters of the API requests.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
*   The vulnerability affects `parse-server` versions up to and including 4.0.0.
*   The fix is included in version 4.1.0.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by `davimacedo`.
* The code changes in the commit remove regex usage in the mentioned fields by converting raw input to strings.
