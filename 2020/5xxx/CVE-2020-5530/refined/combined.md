## Installation

**Automatic installation**

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Easy Property Listings” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking Install Now.

**Manual installation**

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favourite FTP application.

2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.

**Theme Setup – Are you feeling lucky?**

Easy Property Listings includes a theme compatibility mode that works great for most themes. Once you have activated the plugin visit Dashboard > Easy Property Listings > Settings > Theme Setup.

If it looks great, you are good to go, however if your listing is too wide or your sidebar is in the wrong place activate Theme Compatibility mode. Next adjust the Theme Setup: Featured Images to adjust how your featured images appear. If you see two featured images play with the settings until it looks great.

## FAQ

### Will this work for bigger companies with multiple agents?

Absolutely, Easy Property Listings is built from the ground up for scale, speed and thousands of listings. When you want dynamic agent and staff profiles we recommend the [Staff/Agent Directory](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/extensions/staff-directory/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description_tab&utm_content=extensions_link&utm_campaign=epl_extension_staff_directory) extension. This allows you to quickly set-up multiple agent and staff members and automatically display all the agents listings, post activity and use a featured image instead of the default Gravatar.

### We want to display less or more info on the archive and single listing views, how can we create a unique customised look?

You can use the Easy Property Listings template loading system that lets you place all the plugin templates inside themes/YOUR\_THEME/easypropertylistings/ folder and edit everything. You can [read more about how to do that here](https://codex.easypropertylistings.com.au/article/303-how-to-create-custom-widget-templates-using-the-theme-template-loader?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq_tab&utm_content=templates&utm_campaign=epl_documentation).

### How do I setup my WordPress theme to work with Easy Property Listings

In order for correct integration with your WordPress theme please follow these instructions [WordPress Theme configuration instructions](https://codex.easypropertylistings.com.au/article/49-theme-setup?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description_tab&utm_content=codex_link&utm_campaign=codex_theme_setup).

These instructions are also located inside the plugin. Visit Dashboard > Easy Property Listings > Help > Getting Started > Setup your theme to work with the plugin

### Do I need to know code like php or advanced CSS?

We built this plugin from the perspective of a real estate agent as that’s what I used to do. We want this to be an easy to install and use plugin so you can focus on listing/selling and leasing property. No advanced coding knowledge needed, activate the property types and add listings, so no matter your experience it will work for you.

### How do I Show My List of Listings?

The easiest way to display the archive page for your listing:

1. Create a blank page for each listing type you enable called; property, rental, land, business, rural, commercial, commercial-land. You can rename them after.
2. Now these pages will display listings of that type as long as you have added one.

### Is there a sample import file I can use to setup a demo real estate web site?

Yes! Simply go to Tools > Import and install the WordPress Importer, then navigate to wp-content/plugins/easy-property-listing/lib/assets/ and select the sample-property-import.xml file. This will create several sample properties for you, make sure the “property” type is activated.

### Getting a 404 error?

To get rid of the 404 error when viewing a listing, you need to re-save your permalink structure. Go to Settings > Permalinks and click “Save Changes”.

### How do I use the advanced author box on posts and pages?

Place the php function on your single.php template in your theme

### Can I add integrations for third party real estate applications like 1Form or Inspect Real Estate?

Yes, through the addition of one or more of the add-on integrations, you can quickly integrate third party buttons to listings. The add-on gateways currently available:

* [1form](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/extensions/1form/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq_tab&utm_content=extensions_link&utm_campaign=epl_extension_1form)

Plugin kinda works but doesn’t populate the data so the search doesn’t work and the map extension doesn’t work. Support was like talking to a wall. Don’t bother.

I don’t know if they hide key features under the paid tier or what, but I couldn’t get it to show even basic things, and the YouTube instructional videos are all very old, showing windows I just don’t have.

The plugin works great and the functions are very clear and simple to use.I also asked for assistance in using multilingual, and they always answered me kindly and with great availability, although some of my questions were due to my lack of attention in the wordpress configuration.Among the pros there is certainly the support, the use of the block editor (not all real estate plugins have it), page rendering (other plugins need dedicated themes to work).For the more demanding, there are paid extensions (which can always serve).Really a great plugin!
