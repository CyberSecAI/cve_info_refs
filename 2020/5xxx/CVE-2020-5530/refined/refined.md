Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The WordPress plugin "Easy Property Listings" lacks proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352): The plugin doesn't sufficiently validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to potentially trick a logged-in user's browser into making unwanted requests to the website.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause logged-in users to perform unintended actions on the website.
- The specific impact of the unintended actions depends on the functionality vulnerable to CSRF, which is not described in detail in the provided content.
-  Integrity impact is low, with no confidentiality or availability impact.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack (AV:N): The attack is performed remotely over the network.
- User interaction is required (UI:R). The victim needs to interact with a malicious web page or link.
- An attacker crafts a malicious web page or link that includes a forged request targeting the vulnerable WordPress plugin. If a logged-in user visits the malicious page, the browser will unknowingly send the forged request to the WordPress site along with the user's valid session cookie.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious web page.
- No specific user privileges are required (PR:N). The attacker doesn't need to have an account on the target WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user to the malicious page.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects versions of the "Easy Property Listings" plugin prior to 3.4.
- The issue was reported by Rei Nakahara and coordinated by JPCERT/CC.
- The vendor is Merv Barrett, who is the developer of the Easy Property Listings plugin.
- The solution is to update the plugin to the latest version.
