- No specific privileges are required by the attacker (can be an unauthenticated attacker).
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
- iSM Client versions from V5.1 prior to V12.1, when running on NEC Storage Manager or NEC Storage Manager Express.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation).
- The severity is rated as "Medium" with a CVSS v3 score of 4.8 and CVSS v2 score of 4.0.
- The provided documentation offers detailed update instructions depending on whether the user is using the iSM Client with NEC Storage Manager or NEC Storage Manager Express.
