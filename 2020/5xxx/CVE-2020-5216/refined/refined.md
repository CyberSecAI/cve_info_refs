Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-5216:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `secure_headers` gem's handling of user-supplied input when overriding or appending Content Security Policy (CSP) directives. Specifically, the library didn't properly sanitize newline characters (`\n`) in the source lists, leading to header injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Header Injection:** Newline characters in CSP directives could cause Rails to create additional `Content-Security-Policy` headers. Each newline effectively splits the original header value, resulting in multiple, potentially conflicting CSP headers.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The code failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically regarding newline characters in CSP source lists.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing intended CSP:**  Attackers can inject malicious CSP directives. For instance, by inserting a newline followed by `default-src 'none'; report-uri evil.com`, an attacker could effectively override or circumvent the intended CSP of the application, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other attacks.
- **Limited header injection:**  While not arbitrary header injection, attackers can control a portion of the subsequent `Content-Security-Policy` header by introducing newline characters.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through user-supplied input passed into `append_content_security_policy_directives` or `override_content_security_policy_directives`.
- An attacker would need to control the input that gets passed as arguments to these methods, specifically the source lists.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to control or influence the input data that is supplied to the `append_content_security_policy_directives` or `override_content_security_policy_directives` methods of the `secure_headers` gem.
- This typically involves a web application using the affected library and allowing user input to affect the CSP policy.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in `lib/secure_headers/headers/content_security_policy.rb`. Specifically, the code now includes:
  ```ruby
  if minified_source_list =~ /(\n|;)/
    Kernel.warn("#{directive} contains a #{$1} in #{minified_source_list.inspect} which will raise an error in future versions. It has been replaced with a blank space.")
  end
  escaped_source_list = minified_source_list.gsub(/[\n;]/, " ")
  ```
- The code now warns about and replaces both semicolons (`;`) and newlines (`\n`) with spaces to prevent header injection.
- The vulnerability is fixed in versions 6.3.0, 5.2.0 and 3.9.0.
