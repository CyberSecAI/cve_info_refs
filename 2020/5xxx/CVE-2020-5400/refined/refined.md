Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-5400:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Cloud Foundry Cloud Controller (CAPI) logs properties of background jobs when they are run. This includes environment variables and service credentials if provided to the job.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

Sensitive information, such as credentials, is being logged as part of background job execution. This information should not be exposed through logs.

**Impact of exploitation:**

A malicious user with access to these logs could gain unauthorized access to resources protected by the exposed credentials.

**Attack vectors:**

An attacker would need access to the Cloud Controller logs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker must have access to the Cloud Controller logs. This could be through compromised operator accounts, access to log aggregation systems, or other means of log retrieval.

**Additional details:**

The vulnerability affects all versions of CAPI prior to 1.91.0 and all versions of CF Deployment prior to v12.33.0.  The fix involves upgrading to the specified versions. The logs in question will contain the text “about to run job.” Operators are instructed to inform developers to rotate any compromised credentials. This includes service credentials provided to service broker jobs and environment variables provided to apps deployed using server-side manifests (like `cf v3-apply-manifest` or `cf7 push`).
