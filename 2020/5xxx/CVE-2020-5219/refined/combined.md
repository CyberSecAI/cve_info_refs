## Remote Code Execution in Angular Expressions

High severity

GitHub Reviewed

Published

in
[peerigon/angular-expressions](/peerigon/angular-expressions)
•
Updated Jan 9, 2023

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-hxhm-96pp-2m43)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-hxhm-96pp-2m43/dependabot)

## Package

npm

angular-expressions
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.0.1

## Patched versions

1.0.1

## Description

### Impact

The vulnerability, reported by GoSecure Inc, allows Remote Code Execution, if you call `expressions.compile(userControlledInput)` where `userControlledInput` is text that comes from user input.

* If running angular-expressions in the browser, an attacker could run any browser script when the application code calls expressions.compile(userControlledInput).
* If running angular-expressions on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript expression, thus gaining Remote Code Execution.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to version 1.0.1 of angular-expressions

### Workarounds

A temporary workaround might be either to :

* disable user-controlled input that will be fed into angular-expressions in your application

OR

* allow only following characters in the userControlledInput :

```
if (/^[|a-zA-Z.0-9 :"'+-?]+$/.test(userControlledInput)) {
      var result = expressions.compile(userControlledInput);
}
else {
     result = undefined;
}
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Angular Expressions - Remote Code Execution

High

[edi9999](/edi9999)
published
GHSA-hxhm-96pp-2m43
Jan 23, 2020

## Package

npm

angular-expressions
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.0.1

## Patched versions

1.0.1

## Description

### Impact

The vulnerability, reported by GoSecure Inc, allows Remote Code Execution, if you call `expressions.compile(userControlledInput)` where `userControlledInput` is text that comes from user input.

* If running angular-expressions in the browser, an attacker could run any browser script when the application code calls expressions.compile(userControlledInput).
* If running angular-expressions on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript expression, thus gaining Remote Code Execution.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to version 1.0.1 of angular-expressions

### Workarounds

A temporary workaround might be either to :

* disable user-controlled input that will be fed into angular-expressions in your application

OR

* allow only following characters in the userControlledInput :

```
if (/^[|a-zA-Z.0-9 :"'+-?]+$/.test(userControlledInput)) {
      var result = expressions.compile(userControlledInput);
}
else {
     result = undefined;
}
```
