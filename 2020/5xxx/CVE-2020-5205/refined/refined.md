Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5205:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the way `Pow.Plug.Session` manages session IDs in conjunction with `Plug.Session`. Specifically, `Pow.Plug.Session` does not renew the underlying `Plug.Session` when a Pow session is created or rolled. If a persistent session store is used for `Plug.Session` (like Redis or a database), the session ID remains the same across multiple authentications, making it susceptible to session fixation attacks. This is not an issue if `Plug.Session` uses cookie storage (default in Phoenix).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Fixation:** The core vulnerability is session fixation. The application doesn't generate a new session ID upon successful authentication. An attacker can obtain a valid session ID, trick a victim into using that session ID (e.g. through a malicious link), and subsequently hijack the victim's session.
*   **Lack of Session Renewal:** The `Pow.Plug.Session` module does not renew the underlying `Plug.Session` upon user authentication. This allows an attacker to fix the victim's session before they log in.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Hijacking:** A successful session fixation attack allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim's account. Once the victim authenticates using the attacker-provided session ID, the attacker can use that same session ID to impersonate the victim and perform actions as them.
*   **Data Breach:** Depending on the privileges of the compromised account, the attacker could potentially access and exfiltrate sensitive user or application data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Links:** The attacker crafts a URL containing a valid session ID and tricks the victim into clicking it. When the victim authenticates, they are doing so with a session ID controlled by the attacker.
*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could potentially use XSS to inject malicious code that sets a specific session ID in the victim's browser.
*   **META tag injection:** Similar to XSS, this involves injecting HTML META tags to set the session ID via `Set-Cookie`.
*   **HTTP Header Manipulation:** The attacker could intercept and manipulate HTTP responses to insert the session ID into the victim's cookies via the `Set-Cookie` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Obtain Valid Session ID:** The attacker must have the ability to connect to the web server and obtain a legitimate session ID. Alternatively they can create their own valid session ID to be used in the attack.
*   **Ability to Trick Victim:** The attacker must be able to trick the victim into authenticating using the provided session ID. This can be through social engineering (malicious links) or code injection techniques.
*   **Network Position (For Some Vectors):** For the HTTP header manipulation vector, the attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic between the client and the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability primarily affects applications that utilize a persistent session store for `Plug.Session` (Redis, database), but not applications using the default cookie store in Phoenix.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves renewing the `Plug.Session` whenever a Pow session is created or rolled. This is accomplished via the `Conn.configure_session(renew: true)` call.
