Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5277:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- It is caused by insufficient sanitization of the `url_name` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Reflected XSS: The application echoes the unsanitized input from the `url_name` parameter back to the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, which are then executed in the context of the victim's browser.
- This could lead to various attacks:
  - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious URL that includes the payload within the `url_name` parameter.
- When a user clicks on this crafted URL, the malicious script will be executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL and induce a user to click on it.
- The attacker doesn't need direct access to the server or the application code, as it is a client-side attack.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Versions:** Versions prior to 3.5.0 are vulnerable.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.5.0 and later.
- **Introduced by Commit:** The vulnerability was introduced in commit `bdc34d9`.
- **Severity:** The severity is considered Low.
