Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-5805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Credentials for the Marvell QConvergeConsole GUI are stored in cleartext within the `tomcat-users.xml` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cleartext Storage:** Sensitive user credentials (username and password) are stored in an unencrypted format, making them easily readable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** OS-level users on the QCC host, who are not authorized to use QCC, can gain access to the QCC GUI by using the plaintext credentials found in `tomcat-users.xml`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs OS-level access to the QCC host to read the `tomcat-users.xml` file.
- Once the file is read, the attacker can gain remote access to the QCC GUI using the obtained credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have OS-level access to the QCC host where Marvell QConvergeConsole GUI is installed. This implies some level of prior compromise or legitimate system access.
- The attacker must be able to locate and read the `tomcat-users.xml` file.
-The attacker needs network access to the QCC GUI to use the credentials.
