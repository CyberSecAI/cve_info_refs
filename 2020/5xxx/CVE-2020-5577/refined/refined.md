Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5577:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Unrestricted upload of files with specific extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type:** The application allows users to upload files without proper restrictions on the file types, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A user who can upload files may upload arbitrary files and execute PHP scripts. This could lead to:
    *   **Code Execution:** An attacker could upload malicious PHP scripts, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **System Compromise:** By executing malicious code, an attacker could gain control of the server, potentially accessing sensitive data, modifying system configurations, or using the server as a launching point for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
*   **File Upload Functionality:** The attack vector is through the file upload functionality of the Movable Type application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files. This implies they need to have some level of legitimate access to the application or be able to exploit an access control vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Upload Arbitrary Files:**  The attacker must be able to bypass the system's file extension restrictions and upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts).

**Summary**
CVE-2020-5577 is a critical vulnerability that allows an attacker with file upload privileges to upload and execute arbitrary code by uploading files with specific extensions like PHP.
