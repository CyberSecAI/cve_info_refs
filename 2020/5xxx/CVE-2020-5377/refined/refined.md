Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-5377:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, also known as a Path Traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* The Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) versions 9.4 and prior contain multiple path traversal vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An unauthenticated remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain file system access on the compromised management station. This could allow an attacker to read sensitive files, modify system settings, or potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted Web API request containing directory traversal character sequences (e.g., "../").

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected OMSA server. No authentication is required. The attacker can be located remotely.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is in how OMSA handles file paths when receiving a web API request. By crafting a request that includes characters to move up directory paths (e.g., "../"), an attacker can bypass security checks and access files and directories outside the intended scope, potentially leading to information disclosure or system compromise.

**Affected Products:**
* Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA) versions 9.4 and prior, including:
    * Version 9.0.1
    * Version 9.0.2
    * Version 9.2
    * Version 9.2.1
    * Version 9.3
    * Version 9.3.1
    * Version 9.3.2

**Remediation:**
* Upgrade to Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator version 9.3.0.2 or 9.4.0.2

**CVSS Score:**
* CVSSv3 Base Score: 9.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)
