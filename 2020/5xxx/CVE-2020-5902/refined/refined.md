{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI), also referred to as the Configuration utility, improperly neutralizes user-supplied input.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to improper neutralization of user input.",
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS).",
      "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF).",
       "Command injection vulnerability (CWE-74).",
      "Improper access controls to sensitive configuration files.",
       "Lack of role-based access checks allowing for unexpected file access.",
       "Failure to enforce proper authentication and authorization"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the TMUI can execute arbitrary system commands with root privileges, create or delete files, disable services, and gain control of the system. Authenticated users can also perform unexpected actions such as modifying configuration files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending malicious requests to the TMUI web interface.",
      "Exploiting path traversal via crafted URLs, specifically using '/tmui/login.jsp/..;/' sequences.",
        "Abuse of the fileRead.jsp and tmshCmd.jsp endpoints.",
        "Exploitation of command injection vulnerabilities."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Unauthenticated attackers need network access to the TMUI.  Authenticated users can also leverage the vulnerabilities.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability can be exploited using crafted URLs, such as those containing '/tmui/login.jsp/..;/' followed by vulnerable endpoints like fileRead.jsp or tmshCmd.jsp, to read files or execute commands, respectively. Examples provided include reading /etc/passwd, /etc/hosts, /config/bigip.license, and /config/bigip.conf, as well as executing `list auth user admin` using tmshCmd.jsp."
