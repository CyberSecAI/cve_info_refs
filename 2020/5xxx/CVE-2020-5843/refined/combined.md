[STOP Spaming the forum - every Spam will get deleted and accounts banned forever!](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/topic/14390/stop-spaming-the-forum-every-spam-will-get-deleted-and-accounts-banned-forever)

## Hello community,

I have been a volunteer moderator here for many years, helping the Codoloic team in the forum.

### What's going on right now:

As you have noticed, the development of **Codoforum** and **also the support** in the forum have been somewhat limited, or rather, **have come to a standstill** for the time being.
This is for **private reasons**, but the **Codologic team will get back to it**, so you can certainly hope that everything will return to normal - however, **I cannot give you a time frame for this**. Everyone has **good and bad times in life, so please take this into account**.

**Here you can read more avout the topic:**

### Do NOT spam and write in ENGLISH please:

Another important topic is **spam here and language**. **Anyone who leaves spam here will have their topic deleted** in any case, and **if they violate this again, their account will be banned forever**!

So please **refrain from spamming** and **the language in the forum is only ENGLISH**.

 **Thank you very much and best regards**.

Your moderator, WebCrew ![smile](https://codologic.com:443/forum/sites/default/assets/img/smileys/cool.gif)

[Codoforum V5.0 Released](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/topic/12897/codoforum-v5-0-released)
[admin](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/user/profile/1)
posted Sep 13 '20 at 8:36 pm

After months of development and testing and your valuable feedback, we are very pleased to announce the release of new version of our forum, **Codoforum V5.0**
Our primary focus for this release has been the internal framework itself and a whole host of new features.

Here are some of the major changes:

### Highlight to Quote:

Now you can easily quote while replying to topics by simply highlighting any part of the text and clicking the quote button.

### Badges:

Now easily assign badges and make your members feel special.

[![5f5e72d2350a4](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5f5e72d2350a4)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5f5e72d2350a4 "Click to view full size image")
[![5f5e72e655976](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5f5e72e655976)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5f5e72e655976 "Click to view full size image")

You can also upload your own badges from the control panel

[![5f5e73000cbef](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5f5e73000cbef)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5f5e73000cbef "Click to view full size image")

---

### Sticky topic without permission

This is really useful when you want your categories to be private but would want the sticky topic to be visible to users who do not have permission to view the category. This can be toggled from the Global Settings in the Control Panel.

### Login as any user

Note: This feature is for admin users to help debug any issues and hence you are responsible to uphold any privacy laws that are prevalent in your country. This can be accessed from Manage users -> Edit a user, and you should see a button to login as that user.

### Replace Limonade with FastRoute Router

We have been using the Limonade framework for over 6 years now and the framework isn't being maintained and is not compatible with new version of PHP (PHP7.4 and above), Hence we switched to FastRoute, It is written by Nikita Popov, one of the current principal contributors to PHP, Apart from being fast, it is also used as a base for many other frameworks out there.

### Global search feature

We have centralized both the topics and category search into one unified interface with advanced filters and sorting options.
[![5f5e731dcfb24](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5f5e731dcfb24)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5f5e731dcfb24 "Click to view full size image")

### Other Features:

* Responsive videos for mobiles
* Backend options for infinite and hide topic messages
* Libraries moved to composer
* Added vBulletin Importer
* New plugin for Azure Active Directory support
* Faster email batching and dequeue

---

We have made a couple of performance improvements as well as fixed many bugs.

### List of changes:

* Cyrillic characters fixed
* Excerpt updated for better performance and view
* Mentions not working properly fixed
* Title split fixed
* Permission fixes and aggregator fixes
* Made save button responsive in all pages
* Added non-ssl mail support
* Fixed digest bugs
* Infinite scrolling not working fixed
* Fixed responsive theme issues
* More prominent create/reply buttons
* Password fix for PHP 7.4
* Poll edit bug fixed
* BBcode multiline not working fixed
* Added missing translations when infinite scroll in topic
* Delete post bug fixed
* Many Editor UI fixes
* Closed topic permission fix
* Image preview fix
* Template bug fixes

### Preparing for PHP 8 and Codoforum 6

Codoforum so far has maintained strict backwards compatibility, this means you could upgrade from the oldest version of Codoforum to v5 without any major issues. The plugins written for v1 would still work for v5. This ofcourse comes at a price, The price being a lot of bloat to maintain backwards compatibility and a lot of time spent in regression tests. Codoforum v5 removes a lot of bloat and is almost a major rewrite, but as we are tied to PHP 7.3, we still cannot use the new PHP features like, Typed class properties, JIT, Attributes, Null safe operator, named arguments etc which make the code a lot cleaner, faster and easier to maintain.

Hence, we have decided that going forward, the next major release would target PHP 8, Yes, we know PHP 8 isn't out yet and is a few months away but we have already started making preparations for it.

**What would this mean for you?**
Likely nothing to worry about, you will be able to upgrade from V5.x to v6 from the control panel, If your plugins and themes target v5, they will mostly work as they do. If there are issues, we will help you through the upgrade process.

Since Freichat was an offloaded service, it was very difficult to change the look and feel of FreiChat, The upcoming release of FreiChat will have a nice backend to Manage Appearance as well as Translations (The release will also include plenty of bug fixes).

Here is a screenshot of what it looks after you play around with the colors,

[Codoforum v 4.8 released](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/topic/12469/codoforum-v-4-8-released)
[admin](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/user/profile/1)

It is a pleasure to announce the release of the new version of codoforum v4.8

Some highlights in this release:

**Chat**
We have been working on instant messenger feature - FreiChat; for past couple of months. We have now integrated it with codoforum, so you should now be able to see that at bottom right corner of this forum.

You can enable this feature from your forum by first upgrading the FreiChat plugin then enabling it in the Settings:

[![5da7130ba2d1c](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5da7130ba2d1c)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5da7130ba2d1c "Click to view full size image")

**Docker**
We have created a docker image for codoforum with all dependencies which installs itself automatically. So now with one single command you can install any version(>v4.7) of codoforum easily on your local or development setups.

**Role colors**
It is now possible to give unique styles to every role. We have added a new option in the backend under UI Elements -> Role colors

You can simply give the desired color or put your own styles in css for a given role:

[![5da716c04ab55](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5da716c04ab55)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5da716c04ab55 "Click to view full size image")

**New settings/configuration**

You can switch between logo and site title and upload your logo for your site header.

You can now configure whether to use username or email or both for the login screen. This configuration is also applied for the admin login.

[![5da71553ace57](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5da71553ace57)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5da71553ace57 "Click to view full size image")

Codoforum had issues with cached css where icons were not loaded when you switched between http/https or www/without www. This has finally been fixed, and now it will even work for multiple domains pointing to the same forum. There are also other couple of bug fixes in this release.

As always, you can directly upgrade the forum from your backend or download and install the new version from

[https://codoforum.com](https://codoforum.com "codoforum.com ")

[Codoforum v.4.6 released - A new future for FreiChat](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/topic/12073/codoforum-v-4-6-released-a-new-future-for-freichat)

It is a great pleasure to announce a new release of our forum V.4.6

We have fixed some annoying bugs in some plugins and fixed various ui issues.

We have also added a new plugin named 'Anti Spam Rules' for protecting your forum from spam. A visit to the forum just to see spam posts every day should greatly reduce after installing this plugin in your backend.

[![5cb33c099d2ac](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment/preview&path=5cb33c099d2ac)](http://codologic.com/forum/index.php?u=/serve/attachment&path=5cb33c099d2ac "Click to view full size image")

The new release completely gets rids off a huge html manipulation library named simple\_html\_dom which was used by some of the plugins. After removing this, you should see some speed improvements in your page load time.

And last, but the best feature of this release is our Private Messaging component. You should see a plugin named 'FreiChat' now in Codoforum plugins. We have used the latest technologies (ReactJS, Websockets, etc) to give you the best experience with a messaging system. Now messages will be delivered in a blink of an eye.
We will be releasing a new version within next 2 weeks for adding offline notification support in FreiChat PM; so do wait for that.

Cheers!

### Persistent Cross-site Scripting - Admin Category Section

                          **Codoforumv4.8.3 Admin Dashboard XSS**

While I was searching for a free forum software for our community I found Codoforum. After installing it We tried a few simple XSS payloads to ensure the security and suddenly got surprised with finding of multiple critical cross site scripting vulnerability which affects admin users.

**Affected component** : Admin-Category Section

**Attack vector**

Codoforum 4.8.3 allows XSS in the admin dashboard via a category to the Manage Users screen.
XSS triggers each time when we refresh the pages too, xss mainly found in the administrative dashboard of latest codoforum v4.8.3
There is an Reflected and stored cross site scripting vulnerability in the codoforum latest version 4.8.3 where, admin panel is fully affected with Stored as well as reflected cross site scripting The Vulnerability found here is at admin panel category section, each time when the admin refresh the specific page or click on the category section the XSS triggers

**Reproduction steps:**

1. Download and Install Codoforum 4.8.3 in a local server.
2 Go to the administrative-dashboard section >> Navigate to Category Tab

3 Append the input boxes with XSS Payload
4. We can see an XSS pop up if we click on Save button
