### Synopsis

#### CVE-2020-5801 - RSLinxNG.exe Double OpenNamespace Unauthenticated Remote DoS

The OpenNamespace message is sent to TCP port 4241 to obtain a session id. Subsequent requests require a valid session-id to interact with the service listening on that port. In the OpenNamespace message, the session-id field in the message header should be absent or empty. If a second OpenNamespace request is sent with an valid session-id in it, the CFTLDManager::HandleRequest function in RnaDaSvr.dll loaded in RSLinxNG.exe leads to unhandled exception, resulting in termination of RSLinxNG.exe.

#### CVE-2020-5802 - RSLinxNG.exe ConfigureItems Unauthenticated Remote DoS

An attacker-controlled memory allocation size can be passed to the C++ new operator in RnaDaSvr.dll by sending a specially crafted ConfigureItems message to TCP prot 4241. This will cause the new operator to allocate a large amount of memory. It's been observed that a large allocation size (i.e., 0xfffffff3) can cause an unhandled exception in RSLinxNG.exe, which results in process termination of RSLinxNG.exe:

#### CVE-2020-5806 - RSLinxNG.exe LoadIconStream Local DoS

An attacker-controlled memory allocation size can be passed to the C++ new operator in the CServerManager::HandleBrowseLoadIconStreamRequest function in messaging.dll. A local attacker can send a specially crafted LoadIconStream message to 127.0.0.1:7153 to cause the new operator to allocate a large amount of memory. It's been observed that a large allocation size (i.e., 0xffffffff) can cause an unhandled exception in RSLinxNG.exe, which results in process termination of RSLinxNG.exe.

#### CVE-2020-5807  - FactoryTalk Diagnostics Viewer Unauthenticated Remote DoS

An unauthenticated remote attacker can send data to RsvcHost.exe listening on TCP port 5241 to add entries in the FactoryTalk Diagnostics event log. A local user can use the FactoryTalk Diagnostics Viewer (FTDiagViewer.exe) to view the log. The attacker can specify long fields in the log entry, which can cause an unhandled exception by wcscpy\_s() in FTDiagnosticsViewer.dll loaded in FTDiagViewer.exe, resulting in process termination.

#### Description

An unauthenticated remote attacker can send data to RsvcHost.exe listening on TCP port 5241 to add entries in the FactoryTalk Diagnostics event log. The attacker can specify long fields in the log entry, which can cause an unhandled exception in wcscpy\_s() if a local user opens FactoryTalk Diagnostics Viewer (FTDiagViewer.exe) to view the log entry. Observed in FactoryTalk Diagnostics 6.11. All versions of FactoryTalk Diagnostics are affected.
