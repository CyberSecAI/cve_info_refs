Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `wcscpy_s()` function handles long fields in FactoryTalk Diagnostics event log entries. An attacker can inject excessively long strings into the log which are later processed by `wcscpy_s()` potentially causing an unhandled exception, leading to a denial-of-service condition

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of input validation/sanitization for log entries, allowing for arbitrarily long fields.
- Use of `wcscpy_s()` which can be vulnerable to buffer overflows when copying strings that exceed the destination buffer size, without proper length checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial-of-Service (DoS) - Successful exploitation leads to the termination of the FactoryTalk Diagnostics Viewer (FTDiagViewer.exe) process, rendering it unavailable. This disrupts the ability of local users to view diagnostic logs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker sends crafted log entries to `RsvcHost.exe` via TCP port 5241.
- Local user must then open the `FTDiagViewer.exe` to view the log, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the target system (specifically port 5241).
- No authentication is required to inject the malicious logs.
- The attacker does not require local access, they just need to induce a local user to open the affected log viewer after the exploit has been performed.
