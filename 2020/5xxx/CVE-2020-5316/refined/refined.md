- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled search path vulnerability. The application loads DLLs from insecure locations
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability exists due to the application not properly validating the path from where it loads DLLs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local, low-privileged attacker can exploit this vulnerability to load arbitrary DLLs, leading to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A locally authenticated low privileged user is required to exploit this vulnerability.
