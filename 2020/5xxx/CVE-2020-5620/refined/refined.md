Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the handling of uploaded files within Exment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79):** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-controlled data (in this case, data from uploaded files) before displaying it within a web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed when a user views the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a logged-in user's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions such as:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies).
    *   Defacement of the web page.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Phishing for credentials or other sensitive information.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the network by uploading malicious files.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires a user to interact with the malicious content (e.g., viewing a page displaying the uploaded file).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** An attacker needs to have low privileges within the application to upload the malicious file (authenticated access).
*   **Access to Upload Functionality**: The attacker must have the ability to upload files to the Exment application.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Exment versions prior to v3.6.0.
*   The same CVSS scores are assigned to CVE-2020-5619, suggesting similar exploitability and impact. CVE-2020-5619 is related to XSS in some input fields while CVE-2020-5620 is related to XSS in uploaded files.
