Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5556:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an **OS command injection** flaw present in Shihonkanri Plus GOOUT. This occurs because the application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before passing it to the operating system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The core weakness is the application's failure to prevent the execution of arbitrary OS commands via manipulated input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary OS Command Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server where the vulnerable application is hosted. This could lead to:
    *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Access to sensitive data.
    *   **Integrity Violation:** Modification of system files or data.
    *   **Availability Issues:** Denial of service by shutting down or disrupting system services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any prior authentication.
*   **Low Attack Complexity**: The vulnerability is easily exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was confirmed in Shihonkanri Plus GOOUT versions 1.5.8 and 2.2.10, but it was not reproducible in version 2.3.14 in the same directory where the product is installed.
*   The vendor, EKAKIN, was unreachable, preventing any patches or official mitigations. The JPCERT/CC decided to disclose the vulnerability due to the lack of communication from the vendor and to inform users of the risk.
