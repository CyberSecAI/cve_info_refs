# JVN#63834780 Shihonkanri Plus GOOUT vulnerable to OS command injection

## Overview

Shihonkanri Plus GOOUT contains an OS command injection vulnerability.

## Vendor Information

Developer: EKAKIN

Product name and version: Shihonkanri Plus GOOUT Ver1.5.8 and Ver2.2.10

## Description

Shihonkanri Plus GOOUT provided by EKAKIN is a CGI that enables to view data stored in Shihonkanri Plus outside.

Shihonkanri Plus GOOUT contains an OS command injection ([CWE-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)) vulnerability.

## Impact

A remote attacker may execute an arbitrary OS command.

## Solution

**Consider stop using Shihonkanri Plus GOOUT Ver1.5.8ãVer2.2.10**

Since the developer was unreachable, existence of any mitigations is unknown.

## Vendor Opinion

None provided

## JPCERT/CC Addendum

During the meeting of Committee for authorizing the disclosure of unresolved vulnerabilities held on January 16, 2020, it was judged that an advisory for this vulnerability shall be disclosed since all the criteria and conditions described below which are stated in [Standards for Handling Vulnerability related Information of Software Products and Other](http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/netsecurity/vul_notification.pdf) and [Information Security Early Warning Partnership Guideline](https://www.ipa.go.jp/files/000073901.pdf) have been satisfied.

1. The developer of the product is unreachable:

   JPCERT/CC had tried to reach the developer for a period of time (more than 6 months) however there were no responses from the developer. Therefore the committee reached the conclusion that it is reasonable and appropriate to judge the developer is unreachable.

   - No response to 4 separate emails (sent from October 24, 2011 to June 18, 2013)

   - No response to disclosure of the developer's name (listed on September 27, 2013) in "[List of unreachable developers](https://jvn.jp/en/reply/index.html)" and to the disclosure of the name and its version (listed on December 13, 2013) in “[Information Resuest](http://jvn.jp/en/reply/DID97303517.html)” on JVN

   - No response to the announcement of screening procedure for vulnerability disclosure (sent on December 18, 2019)

3. Existence of vulnerability has been verified:

   It was verified that the product contains an OS command injection vulnerability by IPA.  Since an arbitrary OS command can be executed on the server, this violates the "Confidentiality" of the product.  For verification details, refer to the “Verification” section.

5. Not disclosing this case may result in the risk that product users will have no means to know of the existence of the vulnerability in the product:

   By checking the developer’s website, it is assumed that users are permitted to copy, revise, or distribute the product, and it is downloadable via internet. Therefore, the developer cannot directly contact all users of this product to notify of the directory traversal vulnerability.  It was determined that disclosure of this vulnerability is legitimate under these condition.

7. There are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate:

   After considering the developer’s stance and the risk to product users, the committee has judged that there are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate or that disclosure may cause any other issues.
