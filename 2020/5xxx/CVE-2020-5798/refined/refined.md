Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-5798:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper integrity checks in the Druva inSync Client installer for macOS. Specifically, the "postinstall" script of the installer copies plist files used for LaunchDaemons from a user-writable directory to the system's LaunchDaemons directory, allowing for manipulation of these files before they are used to launch processes with root privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The installer copies the plist files from the application's Resources directory, which is writeable by the user.
*   **Lack of Integrity Checks:** The installer does not verify the integrity or source of the plist files before copying them to the LaunchDaemons directory, allowing for user-supplied files.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Due to the weak permissions and lack of checks, a lower-privileged user can replace the legitimate plist files with malicious ones. These malicious files are then used to launch daemons with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local, lower-privileged user can gain root privileges on the system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting malicious plist files, an attacker can execute arbitrary code as root.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the macOS system.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to create directories and manipulate files within the target applicationâ€™s structure before running the installer.
*   **Installer Exploitation:** The attacker must then run the vulnerable installer for the exploit to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a low-privileged user account on the target macOS system.
*   The attacker must be able to write files to the /Applications/Druva inSync.app/Contents/Resources directory.
*   The attacker must then run the installer package after manipulating the configuration files.

**Additional details from the content:**
*   The vulnerability exists in Druva inSync Client installers for macOS versions v6.8.0 and prior.
*   The attack involves manipulating the plist files used to launch the `inSyncDecommission` and `inSyncUpgradeDaemon` daemons.
*   The content provides an example of a malicious plist file and shell commands to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The advisory was initially released on December 4, 2020, after a coordinated disclosure between Tenable and Druva.
*   The Tenable advisory ID for this vulnerability is TRA-2020-67.
