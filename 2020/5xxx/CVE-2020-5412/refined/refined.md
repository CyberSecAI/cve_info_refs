- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Hystrix Dashboard in Spring Cloud Netflix allows the `proxy.stream` endpoint to forward requests to any server reachable by the server hosting the dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control/server-side request forgery (SSRF). The Hystrix Dashboard's proxy functionality lacks proper validation, allowing attackers to potentially access internal services or other resources.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can send requests to servers that should not be exposed publicly. This can lead to unauthorized access to internal resources, data leakage, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious user or attacker can send crafted requests to the Hystrix Dashboard's `proxy.stream` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the Hystrix Dashboard and send requests to the `proxy.stream` endpoint. Access to the internal network where the Spring Cloud Netflix application is deployed is also necessary.
