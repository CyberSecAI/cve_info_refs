Based on the provided information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `/page/search/` parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks targeting the `/page/search/` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any privileges or authentication, but requires user interaction since the injected script will only execute when a victim visits the crafted URL. The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious crafted URL.
