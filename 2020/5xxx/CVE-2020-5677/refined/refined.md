**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in how GROWI processes input URLs. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied URLs, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79):** The application is susceptible to reflected XSS, where malicious scripts are injected through a URL and executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the application interface.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability through a crafted URL.
- **User Interaction Required:** The victim must click on the malicious URL for the attack to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to click on this malicious link.

**Affected Versions:**
- GROWI v4.0.0 and earlier are vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**
