Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5535:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an **OS command injection** flaw in OpenBlocks IoT VX2.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The software is susceptible to the injection of arbitrary OS commands. This likely occurs when user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in an OS command.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary OS Command Execution:** An attacker who can access the device can execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges. This allows complete control over the device.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Network:** The attack vector is "Adjacent Network," meaning the attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to have network access to the OpenBlocks IoT VX2 device (same network segment).
*   **No Authentication Required**: The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in OpenBlocks IoT VX2 prior to Ver.4.0.0 (Ver.3 Series)
* This vulnerability is separate from CVE-2020-5536, which is an improper authentication vulnerability also present in the same product.
* The vendor released an update (FW4.0.0) to address the vulnerability.
