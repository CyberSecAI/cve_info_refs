Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-5666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability (CWE-400) in the web server functionality of MELSEC iQ-R Series CPU modules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability exists in the handling of HTTP packets by the CPU module's web server.
- When the web server is enabled, a specially crafted HTTP packet can cause resource exhaustion.
- If webserver settings are set to "Not Use", the vulnerability is not present

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP packet to the affected CPU module, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- This DoS condition affects the product's program execution and communication capabilities.
- Recovery from the DoS requires a manual reset of the CPU module.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, network-based attack via specially crafted HTTP packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected CPU module.
- No authentication is required.
- High level of skill needed to create the crafted HTTP packets to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**

*   MELSEC iQ-R series R00/01/02CPU Firmware versions from "05" to "19"
*   MELSEC iQ-R series R04/08/16/32/120(EN)CPU Firmware versions from "35" to "51"

**Mitigations and Solutions:**
*   **Software Update:** Apply the appropriate firmware update provided by Mitsubishi Electric.
    *   R00/01/02CPU firmware versions "20" and later
    *   R04/08/16/32/120(EN)CPU firmware versions "52" and later

*   **Workarounds**:
    *   Disable the web server function by setting "To Use or Not to Use Web Server Settings" to "Not Use" in the CPU module parameters, which is the default setting.
    *   Use a firewall, virtual private network (VPN), or other security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the CPU module, particularly when it is accessed over the Internet.
    *   Use the product within a trusted LAN, and restrict access from untrusted networks and hosts using firewalls.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specifically crafted HTTP packet to the affected device when the web server is enabled.
- The default setting for the web server is "Not Use," and if left as such, the device is not vulnerable.
- The vulnerability was reported by Xiaofei.Zhang from China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team and by TOMOOMI IWATA and KINOSHITA SHUNICHI of NEC Corporation.
- JPCERT/CC coordinated with the vendor under the Information Security Early Warning Partnership.
