{
  "CVE-2020-5783": {
    "Root cause": "The login functionality lacks CSRF protection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can create a spoofed login page, tricking legitimate users into logging in on the attacker's page instead of the real one. This can potentially lead to the user's credentials being compromised and the attacker gaining access to the system.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "An attacker creates a malicious web page that mimics the legitimate login page of the vulnerable device.",
      "The attacker tricks a user into accessing the malicious page, for example, through a phishing email or social engineering.",
       "When the user submits their login credentials through this malicious page, they are sent to the attacker controlled server, and not the legitimate login system."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to host a web page that can be made accessible to the victim",
      "Ability to trick user to access the malicious page"
    ]
  }
}
