- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA vGPU plugin where guest-supplied parameters, intended to be validated by the plugin, remain writable by the guest after validation. This allows the guest to subsequently modify these parameters and pass invalid values to plugin handlers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation, specifically the lack of protection for validated parameters from subsequent modification by the guest. This can lead to the passing of invalid parameters to plugin handlers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to denial of service (DoS) or escalation of privileges within the vGPU environment.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring a compromised guest operating system within the vGPU environment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have control over a guest operating system running within a vGPU environment. They must also have the ability to modify parameters intended for the vGPU plugin.
