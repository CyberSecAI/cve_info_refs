# CVE-2020-5405: Directory Traversal with spring-cloud-config-server

HIGH | FEBRUARY 26, 2020 | CVE-2020-5405
# Description

Spring Cloud Config, versions 2.2.x prior to 2.2.2, versions 2.1.x prior to 2.1.7, and older unsupported versions allow applications to serve arbitrary configuration files through the spring-cloud-config-server module. A malicious user, or attacker, can send a request using a specially crafted URL that can lead a directory traversal attack.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions

* Spring Cloud Config
  + 2.2.0 to 2.2.1
  + 2.1.0 to 2.1.6

# Mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation: 2.2.x users should upgrade to 2.2.2, 2.1.x users should upgrade to 2.1.7.  Older versions should upgrade to a supported branch. There are no other mitigation steps necessary. Note that spring-cloud-config-server should only be available on internal networks to clients that require it and it should be secured with Spring Security, this limits exposure to this vulnerability to those with internal network access and those users with proper authentication. Releases that have fixed this issue include:

* Spring Cloud Config
  + 2.2.2
  + 2.1.7
