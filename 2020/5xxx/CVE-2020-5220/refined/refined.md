Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Sylius ResourceBundle was accepting and using any serialization groups passed via an HTTP header. This was unintentional and allowed an attacker to potentially specify serialization groups that could expose sensitive data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The vulnerability stems from the application's ability to accept arbitrary serialization groups from the HTTP header, which are then used during data serialization. This allows an attacker to bypass intended access controls.
*   **Data Exposure:** By manipulating the HTTP header to include different serialization groups, an attacker could potentially access data that is not normally exposed through the intended API endpoints.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The ResourceBundle did not sufficiently validate or restrict the serialization groups provided in the HTTP header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive data that is normally protected by access controls or intended for internal use. This could include information from other APIs such as an Admin API being used from the Shop API.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could expose personal information, system details, or other confidential data, potentially leading to further attacks or abuse.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Header Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the HTTP request header to include arbitrary serialization groups.
*   **API Access:** The attacker interacts with an API exposed by the Sylius ResourceBundle.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the API endpoints that are vulnerable to this issue.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate HTTP request headers to specify custom serialization groups.
*   **Knowledge of Serialization Groups:** While not explicitly stated, knowledge of different serialization groups used in the application would aid the attacker in exploiting the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Sylius ResourceBundle versions prior to 1.3 and in the versions >=1.3.0 <=1.3.12, >=1.4.0 <=1.4.5, >=1.5.0 <=1.5.0, >=1.6.0 <=1.6.2.
*   Patches were provided in versions 1.3.13, 1.4.6, 1.5.1, and 1.6.3. The patch restricts serialization groups to only those defined in the route configuration.
*   A workaround was provided to override the `sylius.resource_controller.request_configuration_factory` service and remove the handling of custom serialization groups from HTTP headers.
