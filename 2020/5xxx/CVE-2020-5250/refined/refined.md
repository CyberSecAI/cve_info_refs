Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5250:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that when a customer edits their address or customer information, the application does not properly validate the provided `id_address` or `id_customer` parameters. The system allows modification of these IDs through form submissions, which can lead to unauthorized access to other users' data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** The application is vulnerable to IDOR, as users can manipulate the `id_address` and `id_customer` parameters in form submissions to access and modify data associated with different users or addresses.
- **Lack of input validation:** There is a lack of proper validation or authorization checks when processing the `id_address` and `id_customer` form parameters. The application does not verify if the user is authorized to modify the address or customer associated with the provided ID.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** Attackers can access and steal personal information, such as addresses and customer details, of other users by manipulating the `id_address` and `id_customer` parameters.
- **Account Takeover:** Attackers could modify customer account information, leading to potential account hijacking.

**Attack vectors:**
-  **Form parameter manipulation:** The attacker can modify the `id_address` or `id_customer` parameters within the HTML form before submitting it.
- **Direct POST request modification:** Attackers can modify the `id_address` or `id_customer` parameters directly in POST requests to the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered customer with the ability to edit their address or profile information.
- The attacker must have a basic understanding of HTTP requests and HTML forms, or be able to use browser developer tools.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects PrestaShop versions prior to 1.7.6.4.
- The issue is present in `CustomerAddressForm.php`, `CustomerAddressFormatter.php`, `CustomerForm.php`, and `CustomerFormatter.php`.
- There is no workaround. A patch is needed.
- The vulnerability is considered critical.
- The identified commit `a4a609b` addresses this vulnerability, where several changes were made in the mentioned files. The changes include removing hidden fields related to the customer/address ID and changing how a customer object is loaded.
