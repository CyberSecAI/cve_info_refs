{
  "CVE-2020-5523": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from improper validation of SSL server certificates and hostname mismatches.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper server certificate verification (CWE-295) and improper host-matching validation (CWE-297).",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack may allow an attacker to eavesdrop on encrypted communications, potentially leading to the interception or modification of data transmitted by the vulnerable application.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, exploiting insecure communication channels via untrusted networks, such as malicious Wi-Fi access points.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic, such as by operating a malicious Wi-Fi access point that the user connects to."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to improper verification of SSL server certificates and hostname mismatch issues in the Android versions of various banking applications.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SSL server certificate verification failure and improper hostname validation.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation allows for eavesdropping and modification of communication contents via man-in-the-middle attacks.",
      "Attack vectors": "Attackers can exploit this vulnerability when users utilize the applications through untrusted networks such as malicious Wi-Fi hotspots.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to intercept network traffic between the user and the legitimate server. This often involves setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point or compromising a router."
