Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-5738:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/cgi-bin/upload_vpntar` endpoint of the Grandstream GXP1600 series firmware. This endpoint accepts a tar file, which is then unpacked into the `/var/user/openvpn/` directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted Path Traversal via Symlinks:** The `untarring` process does not properly handle symbolic links within the uploaded tar file. This allows an attacker to create symlinks pointing outside the intended directory (`/var/user/openvpn/`).
- **Writeable Target Directory:** The directory `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/` is writeable, allowing an attacker to overwrite the root crontab file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution as Root:** By exploiting the symlink vulnerability to overwrite the root crontab, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges. This grants full control over the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely via the web interface on port 80.
- **HTTP POST Request:** A specially crafted tar file containing symlinks is uploaded via an HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/upload_vpntar` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the web interface.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) showing how to exploit the vulnerability by uploading a malicious tar file that overwrites the root cron and executes an attacker-controlled script, which enables a backdoor on port 1270.
- The vulnerable firmware version is 1.0.4.152 and below.
- The content includes information about the disclosure timeline between Tenable and Grandstream.
