Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is described as a "token-related information leakage" issue. The specific mechanism leading to this information leakage isn't detailed, however, the impact indicates a confidentiality issue where sensitive information may be obtained through user interaction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Exposure (CWE-200)
  - The vulnerability allows for the leakage of token-related information.
- The attack complexity is considered high, suggesting that specific conditions or actions are needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the potential exposure of sensitive information.
- There is no mention of data integrity or availability being affected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- User interaction (UI:R) is required for the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication (PR:N) to trigger the vulnerability.
- They must be able to access the system over the network.
- The attacker needs to induce some kind of user action/interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
- The scope of the vulnerability is unchanged (S:U) meaning it is confined to the vulnerable component itself.

**Summary of CVE-2020-5587:**

CVE-2020-5587 describes an information leakage vulnerability related to tokens in Cybozu Garoon. The vulnerability is triggered through the network with user interaction, and could lead to an attacker gaining access to sensitive information, without authentication. It has a CVSS v3 score of 5.3 (Medium) due to the high complexity of exploitation.
