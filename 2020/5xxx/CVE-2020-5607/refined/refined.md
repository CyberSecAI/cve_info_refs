Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5607:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation and sanitization of the `ref` parameter during member login in SHIRASAGI. Specifically, the application was not properly validating the redirect URL before redirecting the user, allowing an attacker to supply a malicious URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Open Redirect:** The core issue is an open redirect vulnerability (CWE-601), where the application redirects users to arbitrary URLs based on user-controlled input.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to adequately validate and sanitize the `ref` parameter, which is used to determine the redirect URL after login.
*   **Lack of proper URL Parsing:** The original code didn't properly check if the provided URL was within the site's domain, allowing redirects to external malicious sites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Phishing Attacks:** An attacker can craft a malicious link containing a `ref` parameter pointing to a phishing site. When a user logs in through this link, they are redirected to the attacker's site, potentially leading to credential theft or other malicious activity.
*   **User Deception:** Users may be tricked into believing they are on the legitimate site when they are actually on a malicious one.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Specially Crafted URL:** The attacker crafts a URL with a malicious `ref` parameter when a member logs in.
*   **User Interaction:** Requires a user to click on the malicious link and log in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create a URL with the malicious `ref` parameter.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need any special privileges or to be authenticated to exploit this. They just need to get a user to click on the malicious URL.
*  **User must be tricked into clicking the malicious link and logging in.**

**Technical Details:**
The provided commit diffs show the following changes made to address the vulnerability:
*  `app/controllers/concerns/member/login_filter.rb`: Removed `redirect_url` method
*  `app/controllers/member/agents/nodes/login_controller.rb`: The `set_member_and_redirect` method now uses `@cur_node.make_trusted_full_url` to validate the `ref` parameter and to determine the redirect URL. It also falls back to `@cur_node.redirect_full_url` and then `@cur_site.full_url` if the `ref` parameter is not set or is invalid. `make_url_if_trusted` method added to validate the provided URL.
*   `app/models/member/node.rb`: Introduced `redirect_full_url` and `make_trusted_full_url` methods to validate the given URL and verify it is within the site's domain.
*   `spec/features/members/agents/nodes/login_spec.rb`: Added a test case to check for open redirect vulnerability.
*   `spec/models/member/node/login_spec.rb`: Added tests for `redirect_full_url` and `make_trusted_full_url` methods.

**Summary of Fix:**
The fix involves adding validation logic to the login process to ensure that the redirect URL is within the site's domain. The `make_trusted_full_url` method is used to construct and validate the full URL using URI parsing and comparing the scheme, host, and port against the site's full URL.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is fixed in SHIRASAGI version 1.13.2.
*   The provided code changes and commit messages clearly indicate the resolution of the open redirect vulnerability by implementing strict URL validation and sanitization, preventing redirects to arbitrary external domains.
*   The fix also introduced test cases to prevent regressions.
