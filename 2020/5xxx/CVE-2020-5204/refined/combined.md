## Description

In uftpd before 2.11, there is a buffer overflow vulnerability in handle\_PORT in ftpcmd.c that is caused by a buffer that is 16 bytes large being filled via sprintf() with user input based on the format specifier string %d.%d.%d.%d. The 16 byte size is correct for valid IPv4 addresses (len('255.255.255.255') == 16), but the format specifier %d allows more than 3 digits. This has been fixed in version 2.11

# CVE-2020-5204

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-5202.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-5208.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-5204 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-5204)

#### Description

In uftpd before 2.11, there is a buffer overflow vulnerability in handle\_PORT in ftpcmd.c that is caused by a buffer that is 16 bytes large being filled via sprintf() with user input based on the format specifier string %d.%d.%d.%d. The 16 byte size is correct for valid IPv4 addresses (len(&#39;255.255.255.255&#39;) == 16), but the format specifier %d allows more than 3 digits. This has been fixed in version 2.11

# Buffer Overflow

Critical

[troglobit](/troglobit)
published
GHSA-wrpr-xw7q-9wvq
Jan 5, 2020

## Package

uftpd

## Affected versions

< v2.11

## Patched versions

v2.11

## Description

### Impact

There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in `handle_PORT` in `ftpcmd.c` that is caused by a buffer that is 16 bytes large being filled via `sprintf()` with user input based on the format specifier string `%d.%d.%d.%d`. The 16 byte size is correct for valid IPv4 addresses (`len('255.255.255.255') == 16`), but the format specifier `%d` allows more than 3 digits.

To reproduce this vulnerability, connect via `netcat <ip> <port>` and write to the FTP server socket the following and observe the child process spawned for the connection SIGABRT:

```
PORT 13371337,12341234,12345678,10102929,1,2

```
### Patches

Fixed in v2.11.

### Workarounds

Only possible workaround is to disable the FTP service until it can be udated to v2.11.

### References

Reported by Aaron Esau.

### For more information

### Severity

Critical

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-5204
