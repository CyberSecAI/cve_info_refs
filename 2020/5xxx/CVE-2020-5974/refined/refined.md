Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-5974:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA JetPack SDK's installation scripts.
*   Incorrect permissions are set on specific directories during the installation process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Directory Permissions:** The core issue is that certain directories within the JetPack SDK installation have overly permissive access rights. Specifically, the permissions on `/etc/nvidia-container-runtime/host-files-for-container.d` and the files within it (`*.csv`) were incorrectly set.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The incorrect permissions allow a local low-privileged attacker to escalate their privileges on the system.
*   The vulnerability has a high severity score, with a base score of 8.8 out of 10.
*   The specific impact of this escalation includes High Confidentiality, High Integrity, and High Availability impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack is considered to have low complexity (AC:L) to exploit
*   **Low Privileges Required:** The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L).
*  **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability (UI:N)
*   **Scope Changed:**  The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C), meaning that a vulnerability in one component could impact other components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local access to a system where the vulnerable NVIDIA JetPack SDK is installed.
*   The attacker needs to have low-level privileges on the system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, TX1, TX2, and Nano devices running Linux for Tegra (L4T), specifically with JetPack SDK versions 4.2 and 4.3.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is resolved in NVIDIA JetPack SDK version 4.4. Users of older versions (4.2 or 4.3) can also manually correct the permissions of the affected directories using the provided `chmod` commands.
*   **Acknowledgement:**  NVIDIA acknowledges Michael de Gans for reporting this vulnerability.
