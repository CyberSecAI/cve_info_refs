# MAGMI Multiple Vulnerabilities

Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

#### CVE-2020-5777 - Remote Authentication Bypass

Here, in MAGMI v0.7.23 source code https://github.com/dweeves/magmi-git/blob/18bd9ec905c90bfc9eaed0c2bf2d3525002e33b9/magmi/inc/magmi\_auth.php#L35, it allows default magmi:magmi credentials to be used in the event a database connection fails. A remote attacker can trigger this connection failure if the Mysql setting *max\_connections* (default 151) is lower than Apache (or another web server) setting *MaxRequestWorkers* (formerly MaxClients) (default 256). This can be done by sending at least 151 simultaneous requests to the Magento website to trigger a "Too many connections" error, then use default magmi:magmi basic authentication to remotely bypass authentication. To recreate the triggering of max connections error, performing a large number of  requests to following URIs worked.

**POST /index.php/newsletter/subscriber/new/**

or

**GET /index.php/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?name=xxx**

Once db connection is maxed out, an attacker can authenticate with default credentials and execute arbitrary commands on the server by uploading a php webshell. This issue has been patched in v0.7.24.

#### CVE-2020-5776 - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Due to the lack of CSRF tokens, RCE (via phpcli command) is possible in the event that a CSRF is leveraged against an existing admin session for MAGMI. At the time of this advisory, no patch exists for this issue.

### Solution

The fix for CVE-2020-5777 is in MAGMI version 0.7.24 and it is recommended to update to that version, however, there is no known solution for CVE-2020-5776 at this time.

#### Description

MAGMI versions prior to 0.7.24 are vulnerable to a remote authentication bypass due to allowing default credentials in the event there is a database connection failure. A remote attacker can trigger this connection failure if the Mysql setting max\_connections (default 151) is lower than Apache (or another web server) setting MaxRequestWorkers (formerly MaxClients) (default 256). This can be done by sending at least 151 simultaneous requests to the Magento website to trigger a "Too many connections" error, then use default magmi:magmi basic authentication to remotely bypass authentication.
