Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5799:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Eat Spray Love mobile app (for both iOS and Android) contains a hardcoded backdoor account. This backdoor is implemented via a hardcoded email address check within the application's code. If a user's email matches the hardcoded email, the application grants administrative privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Backdoor Account:** The hardcoded email address acts as a backdoor, allowing unauthorized access to administrative functionalities.
2.  **Insufficient Security Controls:** The application relies on client-side checks for administrative privileges, which can be easily bypassed by manipulating API requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker who gains access to the backdoor account or is able to forge API requests can:
1. **Modify Data**:
    *   Modify or delete application data, such as walls, problems, images and users.
    *   Access and change private wall data, including password hashes.
2.  **Gain Privileged Access**: Access administrative functions within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Backdoor Abuse:** An attacker could modify the hardcoded email address to their own, thereby granting themselves admin privileges.
2.  **API Forgery:** An attacker can forge API requests, bypassing client-side security checks to access and manipulate data they shouldn't have access to. This includes gaining access to full lists of walls and associated password hashes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Application Access**:  The attacker needs access to the Eat Spray Love mobile application, either by installing the application itself or by reverse engineering the mobile application code.
2.  **API Manipulation**: The attacker should possess the ability to intercept or create API requests, or manipulate the application code and its logic, to bypass client-side security.
3. **Reverse Engineering**: The attacker needs to be able to decompile and inspect the application code to identify the hardcoded backdoor email.
