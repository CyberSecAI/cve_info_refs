Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-5983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA Virtual GPU Manager, specifically in the vGPU plugin and the host driver kernel module.
- The core issue is a potential out-of-bounds write to memory. This occurs when writing to a memory location outside the intended boundary of the frame buffer memory allocated to guest operating systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds Write:** The software allows writing data to memory regions that it shouldn't have access to, specifically outside of the allocated frame buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds write can corrupt data structures, leading to system instability or crashes, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Information Disclosure:** By writing to unintended memory locations, attackers might be able to overwrite data structures or potentially access sensitive information in other memory regions of the hypervisor.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access (AV:L):** The attacker needs to have local access to the system. This implies that a malicious user with access to the guest VM can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Low Complexity (AC:L):** The exploit is not difficult to execute.
- **Low Privileges (PR:L):**  The attacker requires low-level access, indicating that an unprivileged guest OS user can trigger the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction (UI:N):** The vulnerability can be triggered without any interaction with the user.
- **Scope Change (S:C):** This vulnerability has the potential to impact other components and/or VMs on the hypervisor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a guest operating system that is using NVIDIA vGPU software.
- They need to be able to interact with the vGPU plugin and the host driver kernel module.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-5983 describes an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in NVIDIA's vGPU software. This allows a malicious guest OS user to potentially cause denial of service or expose sensitive information by writing to memory locations outside the intended frame buffer.
