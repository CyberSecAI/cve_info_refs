Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-5289:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of enforcement of read permissions when filtering collections using client-provided filter expressions. Specifically, the system allowed a user to construct filter expressions referencing model fields for which they did not have read access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is that the system failed to enforce read permissions for fields referenced in filter expressions. This allowed users to potentially infer the values of sensitive fields by observing changes in the filtered result set.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows a malicious actor to potentially gain unauthorized knowledge about the values of model fields they should not be able to access, by observing the impact of their filter expressions on the returned collection of objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to gain insights into sensitive model fields (e.g., roles, security classifications) without direct read permission.
*   **Data Inference:** By crafting specific filter queries, an attacker could deduce the values of inaccessible fields through "guess and check", since the presence or absence of models in the filtered result reveals information about the field being filtered on.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Client-Provided Filter Expressions:** The attack vector is the filter parameter in the request. The adversary crafts a filter expression that contains fields they are not authorized to access.
*   **Collection Filtering:** The vulnerability is specific to how the system handles collection filtering, which means that any feature that permits the user to provide filter criteria for collections is a potential attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Read Access:** The attacker must have at least read access to *some* field in the model they are targeting. This is required to be able to see the result collection, and therefore to be able to perform the "guess and check" attack by observing changes to that collection.
*   **Knowledge of Model Structure:** The attacker must have some understanding of the data model, particularly the existence and names of inaccessible fields they wish to infer.
*   **Ability to craft filter expressions:** The attacker must be able to use the systems API to craft filter queries on the collection in order to make observations on filtered results.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Elide version 4.5.14.
*   The fix involved enforcing `ReadPermission` for filter joins. This ensures that filter expressions only allow access to fields for which the user has read permission.
*   The vulnerability is only present in models that contain fields with different read permission levels. If all fields of a model have the same read permission, the attacker can only see the data if they already have permission to do so.
