Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5809:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the TinyMCE rich-text editor being configured to allow iframes by default in Umbraco CMS. This allows an authenticated user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into iframes when editing content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Unrestricted use of iframes within the rich text editor.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The injected JavaScript can be executed in the context of other users' browsers.
- A malicious user can escalate privileges to admin by triggering the XSS using an administrator's session.
- Successful privilege escalation could allow the attacker to install malicious umbraco packages, gaining remote code execution.
- An attacker could perform actions on behalf of a victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within an iframe into the TinyMCE rich-text editor.
- The injected code is stored and executed when a victim views the content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Umbraco CMS.
- The attacker must have the ability to edit content using the TinyMCE rich-text editor.
