Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-5420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how the Cloud Foundry Routing component (Gorouter) handles specially crafted HTTP responses. Prior to version 0.206.0, the Gorouter was susceptible to crashing when it received invalid or maliciously formatted HTTP responses from applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Improper Input Handling:** The Gorouter fails to properly handle and parse specific types of invalid HTTP responses, leading to a crash.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to force the Gorouter to crash through malicious input, rendering the service unavailable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, where the Gorouter crashes, making the Cloud Foundry cluster and the apps it routes to unreachable. This has a significant impact on the availability of applications hosted on the platform.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Application Deployment:** A malicious actor with "cf push" access can deploy a specially crafted application designed to return the specific malformed HTTP responses that trigger the vulnerability in the Gorouter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **"cf push" access:** An attacker needs the ability to deploy applications to the Cloud Foundry environment through the `cf push` command. This indicates the attacker requires some level of authorized access to the system.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability is considered high severity.
-   The affected versions include all routing components before version 0.206.0 and CF Deployment before 13.15.0
-   The mitigation requires upgrading the routing component to version 0.206.0 or greater and CF Deployment to 13.15.0 or greater.
