  "CVE-2020-5752": {
    "description": "Relative path traversal in Druva inSync Windows Client 6.6.3 allows a local, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands with SYSTEM privileges.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Druva inSync Windows Client Service (inSyncCPHwnet64.exe) does not properly validate request data prior to passing it to the CreateProcessW() function. Specifically, input validation was implemented to ensure only executables existing in the C:\\ProgramData\\Druva\\inSync4\\ directory can be executed, but this logic can be bypassed by using `..\\` to traverse the directory tree structure.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Path Traversal",
         "Insufficient Input Validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary OS commands can be executed with SYSTEM privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": "A local, unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted RPC request over TCP port 6064.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be local to the machine running the vulnerable software."
    },
    "affected_products": [
      "Druva inSync Windows Client 6.6.3"
    ],
        "remediation": "Upgrade to Druva inSync client version 6.6.4 or higher."
