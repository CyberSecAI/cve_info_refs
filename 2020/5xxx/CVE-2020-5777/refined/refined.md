{
  "CVE-2020-5777": {
    "root_cause": "The MAGMI plugin allows default credentials to be used if a database connection fails.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass due to fallback to default credentials on database connection failure."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attacker can bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands on the server by uploading a php webshell.",
    "attack_vectors": "Remote attacker sends multiple simultaneous requests to the Magento website to trigger a 'Too many connections' error, causing database connection to fail, and then uses default magmi:magmi basic authentication to bypass login.",
     "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send multiple simultaneous requests to trigger the database connection failure and then attempt to authenticate using default credentials. This requires a network connection to the server running the vulnerable application."
