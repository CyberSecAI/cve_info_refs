## [phpBB not vulnerable to ImageMagick exploit](https://blog.phpbb.com/2016/05/05/phpbb-not-vulnerable-to-imagemagick-exploit/ "Permanent Link to phpBB not vulnerable to ImageMagick exploit")

Posted by Marc in [Development](https://blog.phpbb.com/category/development/), [Security](https://blog.phpbb.com/category/security/), [Support](https://blog.phpbb.com/category/support/) on May 5th, 2016

As some of you might have noticed, a security issue has recently been uncovered in ImageMagick, a widely used software suite for displaying and modifying images. You can read about the full details of the exploit on news outlets like Ars Technica ([article on ImageMagick exploit](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/05/easily-exploited-bug-exposes-huge-number-of-sites-to-code-execution-attacks/)) and the [ImageMagick community forum](https://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=29588).

It has come to our attention that admins are unsure whether this affects their phpBB installation and/or what they might have to do to secure their installation.

First and foremost let me make it clear that, based on the currently available information, phpBB is **not vulnerable** to the exploits.

phpBB already verifies the supplied image types and therefore already contains one of the described mitigations for the ImageMagick vulnerabilities.

phpBB supports using ImageMagick for creating thumbnails only. Other parts of phpBB, such as image or general attachment uploads, are not using ImageMagick at all. The described exploits rely on directly passing uploads to ImageMagick and/or passing “clear text” image formats such as SVG or MVG to it. phpBB itself does not support these image types for creating thumbnails and therefore will not pass them onto ImageMagick. Additionally, supported image types are checked for integrity before passing it onto ImageMagick for thumbnail creation. Passing malicious files as described and disguising them as other image types is therefore not possible.

We hope this will help with clearing up any confusion or uncertainty on this subject.

Greetings everyone,

We are pleased to announce the release of phpBB 3.2.9 "The Rise of Bertie". This version is a maintenance and security release of the 3.2.x branch which fixes two minor security issues, introduces further hardening, and resolves various issues reported in previous versions.

Previous versions of phpBB did not properly enforce form tokens on changing group avatars and handling pending group memberships which could have been used to trick users into carrying out unwanted actions. Both of these issues have been found as part of an internal code audit prior to the release of phpBB 3.3. The issues have been assigned CVE-2020-5501 and CVE-2020-5502 respectively.

The fixed issues include, among others, multiple issues with default Nginx and Sphinx configuration files supplied in the phpBB package as well as an issue with calculating the chunk size while using plupload. In addition to that, the fallback on invalid styles data has been improved and emoji support has been added to forum names and topic titles.

As phpBB 3.3 provides a clear update path with minimal breaking changes, phpBB 3.2 will directly enter a reduced maintenance mode during which it will only receive changes for major issues as well as any security issues. The timetable for maintenance and security fixes is as follows:

* End of Maintenance (EOM): April 6th, 2020
* End of Life (EOL): July 6th, 2020

The full list of changes is available in the changelog file within the docs folder contained in the release package. You can find the key highlights of this release on the wiki at <https://wiki.phpbb.com/Release_Highlights/3.2.9> and a list of all issues fixed on our tracker at <https://tracker.phpbb.com/issues/?filter=15193>

**The packages can be downloaded from our [downloads page](https://www.phpbb.com/downloads/).**

The development team thanks everyone who contributed code to this release: 3D-I, Jakub Senko, mrgoldy, EA117, Alfredo Ramos, JoshyPHP, kasimi, rxu, DSR!, oxcom, stevendegroote, KYPREO, v12mike, Matt Friedman

If you have any questions or comments, we'll be happy to address them in the [discussion topic](https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=2534586).
