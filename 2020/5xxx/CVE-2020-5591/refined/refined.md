Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an issue known as "NXNSAttack" which exploits the DNS protocol's mechanism for handling referrals/delegation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The core issue is related to how the XACK DNS server handles delegation information when acting as a full resolver. Specifically, it doesn't sufficiently limit the number of queries it makes to authoritative DNS servers during the name resolution process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause a DoS by:
    *   Degrading the performance of the recursive resolver by forcing it to perform excessive queries.
    *   Using the recursive resolver as a reflector in a reflection attack, amplifying the traffic and causing further disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send DNS queries to a vulnerable XACK DNS server that is configured as a full resolver (cache server feature enabled). No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects XACK DNS versions that use the cache server feature, specifically:
    *   XACK DNS 1.11.0 to 1.11.4
    *   XACK DNS 1.10.0 to 1.10.8
    *   XACK DNS 1.8.0 to 1.8.23
    *   XACK DNS 1.7.0 to 1.7.18
    *   XACK DNS versions before 1.7.0
*   The fix for the vulnerability involves adding a configuration item named `cache_ns_name_limit` that limits the number of queries to authoritative DNS servers for processing delegation information during full resolver name resolution.
*   A workaround exists by setting `cache_recursion_limit` to a smaller value, but this may reduce the name resolution success rate.

This information aligns with the description of NXNSAttack, which involves leveraging recursive resolvers to make excessive queries to authoritative nameservers, either overwhelming the resolver or using it in amplification attacks.
