Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5411:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a deserialization issue in the Jackson library when default typing is enabled. This configuration allows Jackson to deserialize objects based on type information included in the serialized data.
*   Attackers can exploit this by injecting malicious class information into the serialized data, which the vulnerable application then deserializes into objects, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is insecure deserialization of untrusted data. When default typing is enabled, Jackson attempts to instantiate objects based on type hints in the serialized data.
*   **"Serialization Gadgets":** Attackers utilize "deserialization gadgets", which are classes that, when deserialized, can trigger a chain of operations leading to arbitrary code execution. These classes are not inherently malicious but can be misused in this context.
*   **Global Default Typing:** Spring Batch configures Jackson with global default typing enabled, making it susceptible to the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server where the Spring Batch application is running. This could lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Data Store Manipulation:** The attacker needs write access to the data store used by the `JobRepository` where the serialized `ExecutionContext` of Spring Batch jobs is stored.
*   **Maliciously crafted serialized data:** The attacker injects malicious class information into the serialized data that will be deserialized by the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Write access to the JobRepository data store:** The attacker must have the ability to write data to the location where Spring Batch stores the serialized job execution context. This could be a database, file system, or other persistent storage.
*   **Knowledge of Jackson's Default Typing and "Deserialization Gadgets":** The attacker would need knowledge of how Jackson's default typing works and how to use known "deserialization gadget" classes to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was mitigated by blacklisting known "deserialization gadgets" in Jackson. However, the advisory notes that Spring Batch should proactively block unknown gadgets when default typing is enabled.
*   The issue was responsibly reported by Srikanth Ramu.
*   The vulnerability affects Spring Batch versions 4.0.0 to 4.0.4, 4.1.0 to 4.1.4, and 4.2.0 to 4.2.2.
*   The fix is available in Spring Batch version 4.2.3 and later.

The provided github issue link in the second document refers to CVE-2017-7525, not CVE-2020-5411, and thus is not directly related. However, this issue seems to describe the underlying insecure deserialization issue in Jackson library which was later exploited in CVE-2020-5411.
