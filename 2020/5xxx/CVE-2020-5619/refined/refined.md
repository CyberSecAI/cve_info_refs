Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-5619

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in specific input fields within the Exment application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The application allows the storage of malicious script content within its database via vulnerable input fields. This stored script will be executed when a user views the content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a logged-in user's web browser.
*   **Potential for Data Theft/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data, or manipulate page content, redirect users, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into vulnerable input fields of the Exment application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with low-level privileges.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to interact with the application by viewing content that contains the injected malicious script.
