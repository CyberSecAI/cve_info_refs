  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection (SQLi)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries to access, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially leading to full system compromise by executing system commands via --os-shell.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request to the full-profile.php page with a malicious 'id' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted HTTP request. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
