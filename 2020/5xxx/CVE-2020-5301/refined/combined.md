# Information disclosure of source code

Low

[olavmrk](/olavmrk)
published
GHSA-24m3-w8g9-jwpq
Apr 17, 2020

## Package

composer

simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<1.18.6

## Patched versions

1.18.6

## Description

### Background

The module controller in `SimpleSAML\Module` that processes requests for pages

hosted by modules, has code to identify paths ending with `.php` and process

those as PHP code. If no other suitable way of handling the given path exists it

presents the file to the browser.

### Description

The check to identify paths ending with `.php` does not account for uppercase

letters. If someone requests a path ending with e.g. `.PHP` and the server is

serving the code from a case-insensitive file system, such as on Windows, the

processing of the PHP code does not occur, and the source code is instead

presented to the browser.

### Affected versions

SimpleSAMLphp versions **1.18.5 and older**.

### Impact

An attacker may use this issue to gain access to the source code in third-party

modules that is meant to be private, or even sensitive. However, the attack

surface is considered small, as the attack will only work when SimpleSAMLphp

serves such content from a file system that is not case-sensitive, such as on

Windows.

### Resolution

Upgrade the SimpleSAMLphp installation to version **1.18.6**.

### Credit

This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Sławek Naczyński.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-5301

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix source code disclosure on case-insensitive file systems

[Browse files](/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/tree/47968d26a2fd3ed52da70dc09210921d612ce44e)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
If the file system containing the PHP code is case-insensitive, a
request containing an uppercase file extension will return the
contents of the PHP file to the browser instead of executing it.

E.g. a request for this URL will return the source code:

  https:/sp.example.org/simplesaml/module.php/core/frontpage_welcome.PHP

Fix that by converting the path to lowercase before checking the file
extension.
