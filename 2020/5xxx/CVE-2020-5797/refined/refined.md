Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-5797:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of symbolic links when a USB drive is mounted on a TP-Link Archer C9 v1 router. The router's services (SMB and UPnP/DLNA) follow these symbolic links, allowing access to locations on the file system outside of the USB drive's intended scope.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Symbolic Link Following:** The core issue is that the router's SMB and UPnP/DLNA services follow symbolic links on a connected USB drive, enabling traversal outside of the USB drive's file system.
- **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with physical access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Read:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the router's file system, including configuration files that may contain login credentials. Specifically, the `/tmp/dropbear/dropbearpwd` file is cited as containing the router's web interface credentials in plain text.
- **Limited File Write:** The attacker can write to some files, such as `/tmp/wr841n/rc.router`, though the extent of write access is described as limited.
- **Bypass Authentication:** By obtaining the login credentials, an attacker can bypass the router's authentication mechanism and gain administrative control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical access to the router to plug in a crafted USB drive.
- **Network Access:** Once the USB drive is plugged in, the attacker needs network access to the router to access the exposed file system using SMB or DLNA/UPnP clients.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the router to insert the crafted USB drive.
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network as the router to access the shares exposed by the router services.
- **Technical Knowledge:** Requires the ability to create a specially formatted USB drive with symbolic links, and the ability to access network shares using appropriate clients.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in the TP-Link Archer C9(US)\_V1\_180125 firmware.
- While the text mentions that the vulnerability can be exploited via DLNA as well, this was achieved using specific file extensions.
- The vulnerability allows for reading of `/tmp/dropbear/dropbearpwd` to obtain the router's web interface credentials.
- This CVE is related to CVE-2020-5795, which affects a different TP-Link router model (Archer A7 v5) using the same root cause, but achieving different impacts based on the model.
