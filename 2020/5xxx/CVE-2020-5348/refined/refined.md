- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability in `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` within system management mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free, meaning that memory allocated for `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` is freed but then accessed again, which can lead to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can overwrite the `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` structure, allowing for arbitrary code execution within system management mode, which can lead to a complete compromise of the system. The impact is rated as high for confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the affected device. Authentication is not required to trigger the vulnerability.
