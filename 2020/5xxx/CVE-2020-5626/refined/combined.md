# JVN#41853173 OS command injection vulnerability in multiple Infoscience Corporation log management tools

## Overview

Multiple log management tools provided by Infoscience Corporation contain an OS command injection vulnerability.

## Products Affected

* Logstorage version 8.0.0 and earlier
* ELC Analytics version 3.0.0 and earlier

## Description

Infoscience Corporation's multiple log management tools provide an FTP upload function as one of the log collection methods, and is able to set to allow the adminitrators to accept FTP uploads.

In a situation where the FTP upload function is enabled and there is a flaw of input value handling in the log processing, a remote attacker who can upload a crafted log via FTP may execute an arbitrary OS command on the server where the products are running ([CWE-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)).

## Impact

When the FTP upload function is enabled and there is a flaw of input value handling in the log processing function "ScriptHandler", crafted log may be uploaded via FTP and an arbitrary OS command may be executed on the server where the products are running.

## Solution

****Update the Software****

Update to the latest version according to the information provided by the developer.

**Apply the Workaround**

Applying the following workaround may mitigate the impact of this vulnerability.

* Set the file name patterns of which ScriptHandler processes not to be executed by the file names that include the comma.

For more information, refer to the information provided by the developer.
