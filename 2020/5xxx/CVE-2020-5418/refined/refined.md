Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-5418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Cloud Controller (CAPI) in Cloud Foundry had a flaw in its authorization logic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  A user with the `cloud_controller.read` scope could list all droplets in all spaces, even if they had no specific roles within those spaces. This is a bypass of expected access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain knowledge of all droplets in the system, even in spaces where they should not have access.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least the `cloud_controller.read` scope.
-   **API Access:** The attack is performed through interaction with the Cloud Controller API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the Cloud Foundry deployment.
-   The attacker must have the `cloud_controller.read` scope.
-   The attacker does not need any other specific roles within spaces to list droplets in all spaces.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cloud Foundry CAPI versions prior to 1.98.0.
- The vulnerability also affects CF Deployment versions prior to 13.17.0.
- The vendor considers the severity of the vulnerability as low unless otherwise noted.
- The recommended mitigation is to upgrade to CAPI version 1.98.0 or greater, and/or CF Deployment version 13.17.0 or greater.
