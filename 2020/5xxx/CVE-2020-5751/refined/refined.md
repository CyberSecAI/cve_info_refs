**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient output sanitization in TCExam 14.2.2

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   A remote, authenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript.
*   The injected script executes when an operator navigates to `/admin/code/tce_edit_module.php`.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker modifies the first or last name of an operator to include malicious JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated with privileges to edit users. By default, only administrators have this capability, however this can be any user with the ability to edit operator first or last names.
*   The attacker needs to modify a user first or last name to contain malicious JavaScript.
*   The malicious JavaScript is executed when an operator (not an admin) navigates to `admin/code/tce_edit_module.php`.
