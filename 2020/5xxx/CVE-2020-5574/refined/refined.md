Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5574:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to improper handling of input when constructing HTML attribute values. This is described as an "HTML attribute value injection vulnerability".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used as an Attribute Value in an HTML Tag):** This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML attribute values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker can inject arbitrary HTML attribute values. This could lead to various impacts, such as modifying the appearance of the web page, triggering unwanted actions, or possibly redirecting the user. The specific impact depends on the injected attribute and how it's handled by the browser. According to the CVSS score, the integrity of the page can be affected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
*   The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning a user has to perform an action such as clicking a link to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attack is considered to have low complexity (AC:L).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication (PR:N) on the application. They can be external to the target system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious content that is reflected into an HTML attribute. This could involve crafting a URL or other input that the application does not sanitize properly when embedding it in the output.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text indicates that this vulnerability is one of several found in Movable Type and that the vendor has released updates to address it.
*   The vulnerability is present in Movable Type versions 7 r.4606 (7.2.1) and earlier, 6.5.3 and earlier, 6.3.11 and earlier, and Premium versions 1.29 and earlier.
*   The provided CVSS v3 score indicates a base score of 4.7 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N) which has low impact on integrity and no impact on confidentiality or availability.
*   The CVSS v2 score is 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) which is a medium severity vulnerability.
