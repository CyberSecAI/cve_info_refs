Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5533:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of this vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the Aterm WG2600HS device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The device is vulnerable to XSS, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary scripts into a user's web browser when they access a crafted page. This is a common web application vulnerability where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed in the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when they are logged into the device's management interface.
*   This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the management interface
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Redirection to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based.
*   An attacker crafts a malicious web page or injects a malicious script into the Aterm device.
*   When a user with access to the device logs into the management interface using their web browser, they unknowingly trigger the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL or inject the malicious script.
*   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability itself, but the user needs to be logged into the Aterm device's management interface in order to be affected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Aterm WG2600HS devices with firmware versions up to and including Ver1.3.2.
*   The vendor has released firmware version 1.5.1 to address this vulnerability. It appears that updating to Ver 1.5.1 requires a two-step update process from versions prior to 1.3.2, first updating to 1.5.1, and then re-updating to the latest version.
*   The provided information also mentions CVE-2020-5534, which is related to OS command injection.

**CVSS Score:**

*   **CVSS v3:** 6.1 (Medium) - AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   **CVSS v2:** 2.6 (Low) - AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N
