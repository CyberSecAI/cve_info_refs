## JPCERT/CC Addendum

During the meeting of Committee for authorizing the disclosure of unresolved vulnerabilities held on January 16, 2020, it was judged that an advisory for this vulnerability shall be disclosed since all the criteria and conditions described below which are stated in [Standards for Handling Vulnerability related Information of Software Products and Other](http://www.meti.go.jp/policy/netsecurity/vul_notification.pdf) and [Information Security Early Warning Partnership Guideline](https://www.ipa.go.jp/files/000073901.pdf) have been satisfied.

1. The developer of the product is unreachable:

   JPCERT/CC had tried to reach the developer for a period of time (more than 6 months) however there were no responses from the developer. Therefore the committee reached the conclusion that it is reasonable and appropriate to judge the developer is unreachable.

   - No response to 6 separate emails (sent from August 29, 2014 to September 19, 2019)

   - No response to 3 separate contacts via the developer's Web form (posted from November 25, 2014 to March 31, 2015)

   - No response to disclosure of the developer's name (listed on September 18, 2015) in "[List of unreachable developers](https://jvn.jp/en/reply/)" and to the disclosure of the name and its version (listed on December 25, 2015) in “[Information Resuest](https://jvn.jp/en/reply/DID89907906.html)” on JVN

   - No response to the announcement of screening procedure for vulnerability disclosure (sent on December 18, 2019)

3. Existence of vulnerability has been verified:

   It was verified that the product contains a PHP code execution vulnerability by IPA.  Arbitrary PHP code execution on the server where the product runs was confirmed which violates the "Confidentiality" of the product.  For verification details, refer to the “Verification” section.

5. Not disclosing this case may result in the risk that product users will have no means to know of the existence of the vulnerability in the product:

   By checking the developer’s website, it is assumed that users are permitted to copy, revise, or distribute the product, and it is downloadable via internet. Therefore, the developer cannot directly contact all users of this product to notify of the directory traversal vulnerability.  It was determined that disclosure of this vulnerability is legitimate under these condition.

7. There are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate:

   After considering the developer’s stance and the risk to product users, the committee has judged that there are no particular reasons that would make disclosure inappropriate or that disclosure may cause any other issues.
