Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the failure of multiple Fuji Xerox mobile applications to properly verify SSL server certificates. This lack of verification occurs during HTTPS encrypted communication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation):** The core weakness is the absence of proper validation of SSL/TLS server certificates. This allows a malicious actor to potentially intercept and manipulate network traffic by impersonating a legitimate server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker can perform a MitM attack by intercepting communication between the vulnerable application and the server.
*   **Eavesdropping:** The attacker can potentially eavesdrop on encrypted communication, gaining access to sensitive data transmitted between the app and the server.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially modify the data being transmitted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The primary attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to be positioned in the network path between the mobile application and the server.
*   **Malicious Wireless Access Point:**  The vulnerability analysis assumes the attacker sets up a malicious wireless LAN access point to perform the MitM attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic. This could be achieved by setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point or compromising an existing network.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need prior authentication or user interaction other than the user connecting to the network the attacker controls.
*   **Sophistication**: The attacker needs some degree of sophistication to set up and perform a MITM attack.

**Affected Products:**

*   netprint App for iOS 3.2.3 and earlier (CVE-2020-5520)
*   kantan netprint App for iOS 2.0.2 and earlier (CVE-2020-5521)
*  kantan netprint App for Android 2.0.3 and earlier (CVE-2020-5522)
