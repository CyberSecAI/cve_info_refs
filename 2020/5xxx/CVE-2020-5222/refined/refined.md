Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-5222:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a hardcoded system key used in the remember-me functionality of Opencast. This key is used to generate the hash for remember-me tokens, which is used to authenticate users. The hardcoded key was "opencast" in the `etc/security/mh_default_org.xml` configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Hardcoded cryptographic key:** The primary weakness is the use of the same, hardcoded key across all Opencast installations. This key was used to generate the remember-me tokens.
- **Predictable token generation:** The remember-me token is generated using the username, password, and the hardcoded key. Since the key was the same for all installations, it made it possible to use a token from one Opencast server to authenticate on another.
- **MD5 Hash:** The original implementation used MD5 hash for the tokens, which is considered weak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-server authentication bypass:** An attacker who obtains a remember-me token from one Opencast server can use it to gain unauthorized access to other Opencast servers configured with the same credentials if they used the same hardcoded key, without needing the actual login credentials.
- **Cluster-wide compromise:** Within a cluster of Opencast servers, a single compromised remember-me token would potentially allow the attacker to access all machines of that cluster.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Token theft:** An attacker needs to obtain a valid remember-me token from a vulnerable Opencast server. This could be achieved through various methods such as:
    - Interception of network traffic containing the cookie.
    - Accessing a compromised client machine with a stored cookie.
    - Social engineering to trick a user into divulging their token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to obtain a valid remember-me token from a vulnerable Opencast instance (e.g., through network access or access to a user's system/browser).
- No other privileged access to the target systems is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix implemented involved generating a unique key for each server by combining system-specific properties like hostname, IP address, and other unique details from the file system.
- The hashing algorithm was upgraded from MD5 to SHA-512.
