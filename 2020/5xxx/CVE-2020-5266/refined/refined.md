Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-5266:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the title field when creating or editing a link list block in the PrestaShop ps_linklist module.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The module fails to sanitize the "title" field, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "title" field of a link list block. When an administrator views the back office edit page of the module, the injected JavaScript code will execute in their browser. This can lead to various impacts including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement
    - Stealing of sensitive information such as admin credentials or other information accessible through the admin interface.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating or editing a link list block with malicious JavaScript code in the "title" field using the back office interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to access the back office of PrestaShop and the necessary permissions to create or modify link list blocks.
- The attacker must be able to supply malicious input to the vulnerable "title" field.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided commit diff shows the fix for the vulnerability, which involves escaping the `title` using `escape:'html':'UTF-8'` in the `views/templates/hook/linkblock.tpl` file.
- The vulnerability is rated as low severity.
- The affected versions are prior to 3.1.0 of the ps_linklist module.
