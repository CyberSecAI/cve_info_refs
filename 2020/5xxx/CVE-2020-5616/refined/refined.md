Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5616:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an authentication bypass issue. Specifically, the application's session management did not properly isolate sessions between different applications from the same vendor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass (CWE-287):** The core issue is that the application fails to properly segregate session data, allowing a malicious actor, under specific conditions, to gain administrative access. This is due to the lack of a unique session name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A remote attacker could potentially gain administrative privileges on the affected application.
- **Data Modification/Manipulation:** With admin access, an attacker could alter the content, settings, and functionality of the application, potentially leading to data corruption or misuse.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack can be performed remotely over a network.
- **Specific conditions required:** The attacker needs to place a malicious file on the server where the application is hosted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be located anywhere with network connectivity to the server.
- **Server Access:** The attacker requires the ability to upload or create files on the server hosting the vulnerable application. This is usually a low hurdle on poorly secured servers.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerability is due to the use of `session_start()` without a preceding `session_name()` call. This causes the application to use the default session name which can lead to session collisions if multiple applications from the same vendor are installed on the same server.
- The fix is to add a `session_name('YourUniqueName')` call before `session_start()` in each of the admin related files.
- The vendor recommends using a unique `session_name()` for each application, or the same name across all applications from the same vendor if cross-application login is desired.
