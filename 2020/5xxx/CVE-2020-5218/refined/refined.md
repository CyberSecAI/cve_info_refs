{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "The ResourceBundle accepts and uses any serialization groups passed via an HTTP header.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unintended serialization groups can be defined via HTTP headers."
    ],
    "Impact": "Data exposure could occur by using an unintended serialization group, potentially allowing a Shop API to use a more permissive group from the Admin API.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP header with unintended serialization groups to an exposed API using ResourceBundle.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to an API that uses the vulnerable ResourceBundle controller."
