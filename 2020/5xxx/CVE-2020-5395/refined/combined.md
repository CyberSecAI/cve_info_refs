| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1790041#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2020-01-11 14:24:52 UTC  ``` FontForge 20190801 has a out-of-bounds write in SFD_GetFontMetaData in sfd.c.  Upstream issue:  <https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/4084>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1790041#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2020-01-11 14:25:10 UTC  ``` Created fontforge tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1790042](show_bug.cgi?id=1790042 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-5395 fontforge: out-of-bounds write in SFD_GetFontMetaData function in sfd.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1790041#c2)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-14 13:51:52 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/commit/048a91e2682c1a8936ae34dbc7bd70291ec05410>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1790041#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-14 14:29:19 UTC  ``` Vulnerable versions of fontforge allows to set the layer_cnt field of the SplineFont parser to a very big number, which is parsed as a negative number, through the usage of the LayerCount token. This bypass the reallocation of the layers array and subsequently, during the parsing of the Layer token, it writes starting one byte before the beginning of the array. The out-of-bounds write overwrites heap metadata which may be abused to crash the program or possibly execute code.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1790041#c4)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-14 14:41:23 UTC  ``` Impact of the flaw set to Moderate even if the CVSSv3.1 score is 8.8, since we don't consider a network-facing application that accepts untrusted font files as a reasonable use of fontforge tool/library, as also explained upstream in <https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/4086#issuecomment-570772533> .   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1790041#c7)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-14 16:18:45 UTC  ``` Statement:  Impact of the flaw set to Moderate since upstream does not consider a network-facing application that accepts untrusted font files as a reasonable use of fontforge tool/library, making the impact of a possible exploitation of this flaw smaller.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1790041#c11)  Parag Nemade    2020-02-18 05:17:51 UTC  ``` Upstream of fontforge made it clear not to cherry pick upstream commits and patch in Fedora. See <https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/4164#issuecomment-586589395>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1790041#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-28 16:09:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:1921 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1921](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1921)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1790041#c13)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-04-28 16:35:22 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

## Description

![@fcambus](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/825456?v=4&size=48)[fcambus](https://github.com/fcambus)opened [on Jan 3, 2020](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/4084#issue-545070041)

Hi,

While fuzzing FontForge with AFL, I found a heap use-after-free in the SFD\_GetFontMetaData() function, in sfd.c.

Attaching a reproducer (gzipped so GitHub accepts it): [test01.sfd.gz](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/files/4019970/test01.sfd.gz)

Issue can be reproduced in FontForge 20190801 and with latest Git master by running:

```
fontforge test01.sfd

```

```

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 32 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC231](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC231 "Changes/GLIBC231")
* [BINUTILS233](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS233 "Changes/BINUTILS233")
* [FontLangProvidesToLangpacks](/wiki/Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks "Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks")
* [golang1.14](/wiki/Changes/golang1.14 "Changes/golang1.14")
* [GCC10](/wiki/Changes/GCC10 "Changes/GCC10")
* [Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0](/wiki/Changes/Free_Pascal_Compiler_3.2.0 "Changes/Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Monday, January 27th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f32
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f32. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f32 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f32
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f32-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f32 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.
