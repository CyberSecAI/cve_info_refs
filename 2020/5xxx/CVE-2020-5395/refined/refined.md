{
  "CVE-2020-5395": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write in the SFD_GetFontMetaData function within the sfd.c file of FontForge. This occurs when parsing SFD files containing very large LayerCount tokens. By setting a very large value for the layer_cnt field, which gets interpreted as a negative number, the reallocation of the layers array is bypassed. Subsequently, during the parsing of the Layer token, a write occurs starting one byte before the beginning of the array, overwriting heap metadata. This can lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Root cause": "An integer overflow when parsing the LayerCount token in an SFD file, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can overwrite heap metadata, leading to program crashes or possibly arbitrary code execution.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted SFD files"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
       "Ability to craft and provide a malicious SFD file to fontforge",
      "User interaction to open malicious font file"
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The issue was identified through fuzzing and can be triggered via a crafted SFD file with an extremely large LayerCount token."
