Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is triggered by exploiting the BlueBorne vulnerability present in the Bluetooth function of certain Toyota and Lexus vehicles' Display Control Units (DCU).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Bluetooth Vulnerability:** The core issue lies in a vulnerability within the Bluetooth implementation of the DCU, allowing unauthorized access.
*   **Unspecified attack:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to send diagnostic commands to ECUs of the vehicle via Bluetooth.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could cause a DoS condition on the DCU, disrupting its normal operation.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the DCU, leading to further unauthorized actions.
*   **Vehicle Function Manipulation:** While not affecting critical functions like steering, braking, or throttle, some vehicle operations controlled through the DCU could be manipulated.
* **Confidentiality and Integrity Impact**: The vulnerability allows for high impact on confidentiality and integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Bluetooth:** The attack is carried out via the Bluetooth interface of the DCU.
*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be in close physical proximity to the target vehicle to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge:** The attacker needs specific knowledge of the multimedia system software, diagnostic commands and the internal workings of the targeted vehicle and its components.
*   **Tools:** Special tools are required to carry out the exploitation.
*   **Proximity:** The attacker must maintain close proximity to the vehicle for an extended period to compromise the multimedia system.
*   **Unauthenticated access:** An unauthenticated attacker can perform the attack.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Vehicles:** The vulnerability affects certain Lexus and Toyota vehicles equipped with specific multimedia units, specifically 2017 model year DCUs, produced between October 2016 and October 2019.
*   **Geographic Scope:** The affected vehicles are worldwide except for those in Japan.
*   **Mitigation:** Toyota has implemented measures to address the vulnerabilities in vehicles currently being produced, and a software update is available for certain in-market vehicles.
* **CVSS Metrics:** The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3 base score of 8.2, and CVSS v2 base score of 6.5.
