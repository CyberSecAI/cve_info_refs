Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-5740:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper input validation in the Plex Update Service on Windows. Specifically, the service's `Proc2` function, which is accessible via an ALPC port, does not properly validate the executable it is asked to launch. It only checks if the executable is signed by Plex and not if it is a legitimate update file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Insecure direct object reference:** An attacker can provide an arbitrary executable signed by Plex as an input to the function.
-  **Improper Input Validation**: The service does not validate the file being executed, only verifying the digital signature
-  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The service launches the provided executable, even if it's not an update file, using the SYSTEM privilege. This means that by providing a malicious file, the attacker is able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local, unauthenticated attacker can escalate privileges from their user account to SYSTEM.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code with the SYSTEM privileges, gaining complete control of the affected system, allowing modification of data, installation of malware, or other actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the Windows system where Plex Media Server is installed.
- **ALPC Port:** The vulnerability is exposed via an ALPC (Application Layer Protocol Configuration) port, which is used for inter-process communication on the local machine.
- **Signed Executable:** The attacker needs a Plex-signed executable (like PlexScriptHost.exe, a Python interpreter) and a `sitecustomize.py` to achieve code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the target Windows system.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to place a malicious file named `sitecustomize.py` in the directory where the signed Plex executable is executed to exploit the Python interpreter behavior and achieve code execution.

**Additional Information:**
- The `PlexScriptHost.exe` is vulnerable due to the Python interpreter's behavior of executing the `sitecustomize.py` file, if it exists, in its working directory.
- The vulnerability exists in Plex Media Server on Windows versions prior to 1.18.2
- Plex Media Server versions 1.19.1.2701 & 1.19.2.2702 (and newer) features additional hardening in the updater infrastructure to protect against future vulnerabilities
