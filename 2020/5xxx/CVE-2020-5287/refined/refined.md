Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-5287:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an improper access control issue in the customer search functionality within PrestaShop. Sensitive customer data was being returned in the search results, which could be accessed by unauthorized users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core vulnerability is a lack of proper access control during customer searches. The system was not adequately filtering the data returned, leading to the exposure of sensitive fields.
- **Information Disclosure:** The search functionality was returning more information than was necessary, specifically including sensitive customer details like `passwd`, `secure_key`, `last_passwd_gen`, `reset_password_token`, and `reset_password_validity`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Exposure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive customer information, including passwords, secure keys, and password reset tokens, which could then be used for malicious purposes, such as account takeover.
- **Privacy Violation:** The exposure of personal information violates user privacy and can lead to reputational damage for the affected e-commerce platform.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered through the `searchCustomers` action within the `AdminCustomersController`, which is called through an AJAX request in the `prices.tpl` file in the admin panel. This is likely done when editing product prices and selecting a specific customer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need to have access to the PrestaShop admin panel and be able to navigate to the product editing page where customer-specific prices are set. The attacker doesn't necessarily need to be an administrator; however, they need to have the rights to modify products and interact with the customer selection feature during specific price assignment.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `dc99f52` and fixed by commit `27e49d8`.
- The fix involves removing the sensitive fields before returning the customer data from the search handler, thus preventing the disclosure of sensitive data.
- The affected versions are identified as being prior to 1.7.6.5.
- The severity of this vulnerability is considered to be moderate.
