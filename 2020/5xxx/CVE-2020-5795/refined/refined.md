Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5795:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the TP-Link Archer A7 v5 router improperly handling symbolic links on a USB drive connected to the device. Specifically, the DLNA service follows symbolic links, allowing access to the file system and sensitive files by default. Additionally, the router's configuration can be modified to enable symbolic link following over SMB and FTP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Symbolic Link Following:** The primary weakness is the router's media server (DLNA) and optionally SMB/FTP services following symbolic links on a USB drive, leading to unauthorized file access.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The router lacks proper validation or sanitization of USB drive contents, enabling an attacker to place malicious symlinks.
- **Insecure Default Configurations:** The default configuration of the DLNA service allows symlink following, and configuration changes can be made to enable symlink following in other services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Pre-Authentication:** An attacker with physical and network access can read arbitrary files, including `/etc/config/usbshare`, to obtain plain text credentials for router admin interface and network shares by using a crafted USB drive with specific symlinks.
- **Post-Authentication:** An attacker with admin access can modify the USB sharing settings to enable write access to the file system via SMB or FTP. After gaining write access, they can upload and execute arbitrary code as root, taking complete control of the router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:**  An attacker needs physical access to the router to plug in a specially crafted USB drive.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker also needs network access to interact with the router's services (DLNA, SMB, FTP) and exploit the symlink traversal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Physical Access:**  An attacker requires physical access to the router to insert a malicious USB drive.
-   **Network Proximity:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the router to exploit the vulnerabilities.
-  **Post-Authentication (for code execution):** In order to achieve arbitrary code execution, the attacker requires administrative access. This can be acquired by exploiting the file read vulnerability.
