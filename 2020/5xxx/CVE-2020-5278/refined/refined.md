Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5278:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue within the exception page of PrestaShop. This occurred because the exception message was not properly sanitized before being displayed on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the exception message and then executed in the victim's browser when the exception page is rendered.
- **Insufficient Output Sanitization:** The core issue lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the exception message before it is displayed in the HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to various impacts, including:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate the user.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page or making API requests on behalf of the user.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated Exception Messages:** Attackers can trigger exceptions with crafted messages that contain malicious JavaScript code.
- **Indirect Injection:**  The attacker might not directly inject the script on the targeted website, but the script is reflected back to the user's browser without being sanitized.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers may use social engineering techniques to trick users into triggering the vulnerable exception page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Trigger Exceptions:** Attackers need to be able to trigger exceptions on the targeted PrestaShop site. This may involve using crafted input values, exploiting other vulnerabilities, or performing actions that cause an error.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable page:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the exception page and the context of how it generates the output.
- **No privileged access required:** The attacker does not require any kind of privileged access to the website to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `a788394a4aa4695d329655bb3746890e0bf32a0a`.
- The fix was implemented in version 1.7.6.5 by commit `ea85210d6e5d81f058b55764bc4608cdb0b36c5d` which introduced escaping of the exception message.
- The vulnerability affects versions of PrestaShop prior to 1.7.6.5.
