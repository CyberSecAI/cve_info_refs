Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-5284:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue in Next.js versions below 9.3.2.
*   Attackers could craft special requests to access files within the `.next` directory (also referred to as the "dist directory").
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or validation of file paths requested by the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The application fails to properly restrict access to the file system, allowing the attacker to traverse directories outside of the intended scope and access arbitrary files within the `.next` directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Access:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive build assets, application configuration, or other files stored within the `.next` directory.
*   **Information Disclosure:** If sensitive information is stored in the accessed files, this vulnerability could lead to information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** Attackers can manipulate HTTP requests, specifically the file paths, to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in order to access files outside of the allowed scope.
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Next.js application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring any specific authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability specifically affects users of Next.js below version 9.3.2 that use `next start`.
*   Deployments on ZEIT Now v2, using the `serverless` target, or using `next export` are not affected.
*   The fix ensures that only known filesystem paths of `.next/static` are made available under `/_next/static`, preventing access to other files in the `.next` directory.
*   The issue was discovered and responsibly disclosed by Luca Carettoni from Doyensec.
*   Regression tests were added to prevent future occurrences.
