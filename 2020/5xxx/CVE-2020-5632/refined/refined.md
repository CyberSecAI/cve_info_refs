Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper access permissions assigned to files installed by NEC Corporation's InfoCage SiteShell. Specifically, service executable files can be modified by local users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource:** The core issue is that the software installs files with overly permissive access rights, allowing unauthorized modification.
-  Service executable files can be modified by 'Everyone' users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A local user can modify the service executable files, leading to the execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This could result in a complete compromise of the affected system.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** The impact is rated as high across all three areas, suggesting significant potential damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack is local, meaning the attacker must have access to the system where InfoCage SiteShell is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the machine.
- **Low Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a user with low privileges.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of InfoCage SiteShell for both IIS and Apache on Windows.
- Patches were released for versions 2.0.0.6 and higher, with older versions being marked as End-of-Standard-Support.
- The vulnerability was reported to IPA by NEC Corporation and coordinated under the Information Security Early Warning Partnership.
