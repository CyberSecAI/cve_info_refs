## 📚 Project Definition

BookStack is an opinionated documentation platform that provides a pleasant and simple out-of-the-box experience. New users to an instance should find the experience intuitive and only basic word-processing skills should be required to get involved in creating content on BookStack. The platform should provide advanced power features to those that desire it but they should not interfere with the core simple user experience.

BookStack is not designed as an extensible platform to be used for purposes that differ to the statement above.

In regard to development philosophy, BookStack has a relaxed, open & positive approach. At the end of the day this is free software developed and maintained by people donating their own free time.

You can read more about the project and its origins in [our FAQ here](https://www.bookstackapp.com/about/project-faq/).

## 🛠️ Development & Testing

Please see our [development docs](/BookStackApp/BookStack/blob/development/dev/docs/development.md) for full details regarding work on the BookStack source code.

If you're just looking to customize or extend your own BookStack instance, take a look at our [Hacking BookStack documentation page](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/hacking-bookstack/) for details on various options to achieve this without altering the BookStack source code.

Details about BookStack's versioning scheme and the general release process [can be found here](/BookStackApp/BookStack/blob/development/dev/docs/release-process.md).

## 🌎 Translations

Translations for text within BookStack is managed through the [BookStack project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/bookstack). Some strings have colon-prefixed variables such as `:userName`. Leave these values as they are as they will be replaced at run-time.

Please use [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/bookstack) to contribute translations instead of opening a pull request. The translations within the working codebase can be out-of-date, and merging via code can cause conflicts & sync issues. If for some reason you can't use Crowdin feel free to open an issue to discuss alternative options.

If you'd like a new language to be added to Crowdin, for you to be able to provide translations for, please [open a new issue here](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/new?template=language_request.yml).

Please note, translations in BookStack are provided to the "Crowdin Global Translation Memory" which helps BookStack and other projects with finding translations. If you are not happy with contributing to this then providing translations to BookStack, even manually via GitHub, is not advised.

## 🎁 Contributing, Issues & Pull Requests

Feel free to [create issues](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/new/choose) to request new features or to report bugs & problems. Just please follow the template given when creating the issue.

Pull requests are welcome but, unless it's a small tweak, it may be best to open the pull request early or create an issue for your intended change to discuss how it will fit into the project and plan out the merge. Just because a feature request exists, or is tagged, does not mean that feature would be accepted into the core project.

Pull requests should be created from the `development` branch since they will be merged back into `development` once done. Please do not build from or request a merge into the `release` branch as this is only for publishing releases. If you are looking to alter CSS or JavaScript content please edit the source files found in `resources/`. Any CSS or JS files within `public` are built from these source files and therefore should not be edited directly.

The project's code of conduct [can be found here](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/blob/development/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 🔒 Security

Security information for administering a BookStack instance can be found on the [documentation site here](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/security/).

If you'd like to be notified of new potential security concerns you can [sign-up to the BookStack security mailing list](https://updates.bookstackapp.com/signup/bookstack-security-updates).

If you would like to report a security concern, details of doing so [can be found here](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/blob/development/.github/SECURITY.md).

## ♿ Accessibility

We want BookStack to remain accessible to as many people as possible. We aim for at least WCAG 2.1 Level A standards where possible although we do not strictly test this upon each release. If you come across any accessibility issues please feel free to open an issue.

**Security Release**

This release patches a security vulnerability that allowed PHP files to be uploaded via image upload endpoints. The PHP files could then be called externally to perform malicious activity.

This is particularly an issue in environments where untrusted users have the necessary permissions to upload images.

Please consider that malicious exploitation of this vulnerability may have allowed access to other files on your server that the PHP process has access to, Including your BookStack `.env` file, so consider updating any passwords or keys if you think this had a possibility of being exploited on your instance.

It is advised you update your BookStack instance as soon as possible.

**Security Release**

This release patches a security vulnerability that allowed PHP files, using a non-`.php` extension, to be uploaded via image upload endpoints. The PHP files could then be called externally to perform malicious activity.

This is a continuation upon the security updates enforced in [v0.25.3](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.25.3). Please see that release for further information on this kind of vulnerability.

This update applies a whitelist to file extensions for uploaded images to ensure php-like files, such as `.phtml` or `.php3`, cannot exploit web servers that execute such files.

**Security Release**

This release works on the changes from v0.25.4 and v0.25.3 to include additional security measures on file uploads.

For this release, Uploaded image files which have a name that includes more than a single extension are prevented from being uploaded since these could be used to upload executable files on some web-servers. In addition, Attachment uploads are now saved with randomly generated file names to make such upload operations safer to file name exploits.

**Additional Changes**

This release also contains the following translation updates:

* Added Czech translations. Thanks to [@cima](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/pull/1347). ([#1347](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/pull/1347))
* Updated russian translations . Thanks to [@agvol](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/pull/1348). ([#1348](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/pull/1348))
* Updated 'Spanish Argentina' translation. Thanks to [@leomartinez](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/pull/1327). ([#1327](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/pull/1327))

# Remote Code Execution Through Image Uploads

High

[ssddanbrown](/ssddanbrown)
published
GHSA-g9rq-x4fj-f5hx
Mar 8, 2020

## Package

BookStack

## Affected versions

< 0.25.5

## Patched versions

0.25.3, 0.25.4, 0.25.5

## Description

### Impact

A user could upload PHP files through image upload functions, which would allow them to execute code on the host system remotely. They would then have the permissions of the PHP process.

This most impacts scenarios where non-trusted users are given permission to upload images in any area of the application.

### Patches

The issue was addressed in a series of patches: v0.25.3, v0.25.4 & v0.25.5.

Users should upgrade to at least v0.25.5 to avoid this patch but ideally the latest BookStack version as previous versions are un-supported.

### Workarounds

Depending on BookStack version, you could use the [local\_secure](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/upload-config/#local-secure) image storage option, or use s3 or a similar compatible service.

Preventing direct execution of any `php` files, apart from the `public/index.php` file, though web-server configuration would also prevent this.
