Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-5241

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of default output escaping in the `matestack-ui-core` library. The library does not automatically escape strings, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts when user-provided data is included in the output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Specifically, the library does not escape strings by default, allowing for the injection of arbitrary scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the rendered web page.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers may be able to steal user session data (cookies)
*   **Page Defacement:** Malicious scripts could modify the page content, redirect users, or perform other unwanted actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **User-Provided Data:** The attack vector is user-provided data that is not properly sanitized or escaped before being displayed on the page. This includes data embedded within the UI, or in components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Inject Data:** An attacker would need a way to inject malicious code or script into the application via user provided data that is not sanitized or escaped by the application. This could include a form input or by directly modifying data stored in the database.

**Technical Details**

The provided example code demonstrates how an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript:

```ruby
class Pages::MyApp::MyExamplePage < Matestack::Ui::Page

  class FakeUser < Struct.new(:name)
  end

  def prepare
    @user = FakeUser.new("<script>alert('such hack many wow')</script>")
  end

  def response
    components {
      div do
        heading size: 1, text: "Hello #{@user.name}" # is not escaped
        plain "Hello #{@user.name}" # is not escaped
      end
    }
  end
end
```

In the code above, the `FakeUser`'s name contains a `<script>` tag. Since `matestack-ui-core` does not escape the `user.name` by default, the script is injected into the HTML output, causing it to execute when the page is rendered in the browser.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was patched in version 0.7.4. The recommended mitigation is to upgrade to version 0.7.4 or later. As a workaround, developers can manually escape strings using appropriate escaping functions before passing them into components.
