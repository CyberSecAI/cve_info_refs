Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5642:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing security nonce (CSRF token) check in the "Live Chat - Live support" WordPress plugin when processing the 'login' action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF because it does not properly validate the origin of requests when performing the login action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the WordPress site.  This could potentially include unauthorized changes to the plugin settings or other functionalities depending on how the login is handled by the plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can host a malicious web page that contains a crafted request that targets the vulnerable WordPress plugin. When a logged-in user visits this malicious page, the request is executed, leading to the unintended action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious web page and entice a logged-in WordPress user to visit it. No specific privileges on the WordPress site are needed by the attacker.
- The user must be logged into the WordPress site where the vulnerable plugin is installed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions 3.1.0 and earlier of the "Live Chat - Live support" WordPress plugin.
- The fix involves adding a `wp_verify_nonce()` check to validate the security token before processing the login action.
- The patch also includes sanitization of user-provided input in some parts of the plugin settings.
- The plugin has been updated to version 3.2.0, which includes this security fix and other enhancements.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 4.3 (Medium), and the CVSS v2 base score is 2.6 (Low).
