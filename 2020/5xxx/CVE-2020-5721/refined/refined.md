Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-5721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The MikroTik WinBox application (versions 3.22 and below) stores user passwords in cleartext within the `settings.cfg.viw` configuration file when the "Keep Password" option is enabled and no Master Password is set. This file is stored in the user's `AppData/Roaming` directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Data:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of user passwords in plain, unencrypted text.
*   **Default Setting:** The "Keep Password" option, which triggers the cleartext storage, is enabled by default, making users vulnerable out-of-the-box.
*  **Lack of Master Password:** The vulnerability is also dependent on the fact that no master password is set.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who gains access to the `settings.cfg.viw` file can extract the username and password of a WinBox user.
*   **Router Compromise:** With the extracted credentials, the attacker can gain full access to the targeted MikroTik router, leading to further compromise, data theft, manipulation, or denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System Access:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to the local file system of a computer where WinBox is installed. This could be achieved through various means, such as malware, phishing, or physical access to the machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker must have local access to the machine where the Winbox application is installed.
*   **File System Navigation:** The attacker needs to be able to navigate the file system to locate the vulnerable configuration file (`settings.cfg.viw`) within the user's `AppData/Roaming` directory.
*   **Credential Extraction:** The attacker needs to know where to look for the login and password (identified by the `login` and `pwd` keywords).
