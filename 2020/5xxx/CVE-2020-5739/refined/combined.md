# Grandstream GXP1600 Series Multiple Issues

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

While investigating the Grandstream GXP1625, Tenable found a couple of vulnerabilities that allow an authenticated remote attacker to gain root access.

#### CVE-2020-5738: Authenticated RCE via Tar Upload

A remote authenticated attacker can abuse the endpoint */cgi-bin/upload\_vpntar* to achieve arbitrary code execution as **root**. *upload\_vpntar* accepts a tar file that is unpacked into */var/user/openvpn/*. The untarring allows for symlinks to be dropped in */var/user/openvpn*. An attacker can then untar through the symlink to anywhere writeable on disk. Specifically, the */var/spool/cron/crontabs/* directory is writeable. By overwriting the root crontab file, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts and therefore achieve root access.

The following is the output from our proof of concept which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/tenable/poc/tree/master/grandstream/gxp1600). The PoC will upload a tar file which will overwrite the root cron and execute the script */var/user/openvpn/attack\_script* to enable a backdoor on 1270. Note that it may take a minute for the crontab to be processed.

```

#### CVE-2020-5739: Authenticated RCE via OpenVPN Configuration File

A remote authenticated attacker can abuse the *OpenVPN Settings* to achieve arbitrary code execution as root. The *Additional Options* field allows the user to append arbitrary OpenVPN configuration settings to the config file. If a user were to append the following:

```

script-security 2; up "/bin/ash -c 'telnetd -l /bin/sh -p 1271'";

```

Then, when the VPN connection has been established, OpenVPN will execute the *up script* and thereby open a root backdoor on port 1271. If you don't mind a little self-promotion, I suggested this attack in a blog titled, *[Reverse Shell from an OpenVPN Configuration File](https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/reverse-shell-from-an-openvpn-configuration-file-73fd8b1d38da)* a couple of years ago.

### Solution

At the time of writing, Grandstream has yet to release a patch.
