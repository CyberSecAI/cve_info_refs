Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the OpenVPN configuration settings. Specifically, the "Additional Options" field in the web interface allows users to inject arbitrary OpenVPN configuration directives.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** By injecting malicious OpenVPN directives, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. The vulnerability lies in the ability to specify a malicious "up" script in the OpenVPN configuration.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The "Additional Options" field does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to:
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Due to the root access achieved, the attacker can gain full control of the vulnerable device. This can allow the attacker to install backdoors, steal sensitive data, or cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability through the web interface, making it a remote attack vector.
- **Authenticated:** The attacker needs valid user credentials to access the OpenVPN settings page and inject the malicious configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable Grandstream device.
- **Valid Credentials:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to log into the device's web interface.
- **Knowledge of OpenVPN directives:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `script-security` and `up` OpenVPN directives and how they can be used to execute arbitrary commands.
