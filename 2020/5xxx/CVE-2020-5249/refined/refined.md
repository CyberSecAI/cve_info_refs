  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-controlled data before using it to construct HTTP response headers, specifically early hints headers. The vulnerability exists because the application does not reject headers containing carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) characters.",
    "weaknesses": "HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability. Improper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious content into HTTP response headers using CR and LF characters.",
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious content such as additional headers or an entirely new response body by exploiting the HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker injects CR and LF characters in untrusted input that is later used in HTTP response headers. Specifically, in the case of early hints, the attacker would provide malicious input that could split the headers.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests that can inject malicious characters into HTTP response headers, specifically when the application is using those characters in setting up the early hints. They need to have knowledge about the application's usage of user provided data in constructing headers."
