Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix of a previous vulnerability (TRA-2020-03) which allows a rogue keypad to be paired to a SimpliSafe SS3 base station through an alternate channel that bypasses the normal authentication process. This alternate channel is enabled by a physical button on the base station used for pairing new devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authentication bypass: A rogue keypad, already paired to another base station, can be paired to a victim's base station without requiring any existing PIN.
- Insecure pairing process: The physical pairing button on the base station lacks proper access control, allowing unauthorized devices to be paired.
- Incomplete fix: The previous patch for TRA-2020-03 did not fully resolve the underlying issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Bypassing authentication enables a local attacker to add new PINs to the victim base station.
- Attackers can disarm the system using the newly added PINs, effectively disabling security measures.
- An attacker can gain full control over the victim system by adding a master pin.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical access to the base station is required to press the pairing button.
- The attacker needs a rogue keypad that is already paired to another SimpliSafe base station.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local, unauthenticated access to the SimpliSafe SS3 base station and a rogue keypad. The attacker is more likely an insider as the attack requires the attacker to be close to the device for a period.
- Ability to press the physical pairing button on the bottom of the base station.
- The attacker has a rogue keypad that was previously paired to a different SimpliSafe base station.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects SimpliSafe SS3 firmware versions prior to 1.6.
- The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how to use a rogue keypad to add PINs to the victim system and disarm it.
- The attack can be executed even when the victim system is armed in "home" or "away" mode.
- The attack can be completed in under 30 seconds if the attacker is physically close to the system, however, in the testing described by the source, it is not possible for an attacker to complete the steps in less than 30 seconds and therefore this is more likely an insider attack.
- The vulnerability was discovered and disclosed on January 16, 2020 and publicly disclosed by Tenable on May 1, 2020.
