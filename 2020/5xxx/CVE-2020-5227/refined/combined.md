## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.

# Feedgen Vulnerable Against XML Denial of Service Attacks

High

[lkiesow](/lkiesow)
published
GHSA-g8q7-xv52-hf9f
Jan 28, 2020

## Package

pip

feedgen
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 0.9.0

## Patched versions

0.9.0

## Description

### Impact

The *feedgen* library allows supplying XML as content for some of the available fields. This XML will be parsed and integrated into the existing XML tree. During this process, feedgen is vulnerable to [XML Denial of Service Attacks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2009/november/xml-denial-of-service-attacks-and-defenses) (e.g. XML Bomb).

This becomes a concern in particular if feedgen is used to include content from untrused sources and if XML (including XHTML) is directly included instead of providing plain tex content only.

### Patches

This problem has been fixed in feedgen 0.9.0 which disallows XML entity expansion and external resources.

### Workarounds

Updating is strongly recommended and should not be problematic. Nevertheless, as a workaround, avoid providing XML directly to feedgen or ensure that no entity expansion is part of the XML.

# Security Briefs - XML Denial of Service Attacks and Defenses

By [Bryan Sullivan](%5Carchive%5Cmsdn-magazine%5Cauthors%5CBryan_Sullivan) | November 2009

Denial of service (DoS) attacks are among the oldest types of attacks against Web sites. Documented DoS attacks exist at least as far back as 1992, which predates SQL injection (discovered in 1998), cross-site scripting (JavaScript wasnât invented until 1995), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF attacks generally require session cookies, and cookies werenât introduced until 1994).

From the beginning, DoS attacks were highly popular with the hacker community, and itâs easy to understand why. A single âscript kiddieâ attacker with a minimal amount of skill and resources could generate a flood of TCP SYN (for synchronize) requests sufficient to knock a site out of service. For the fledgling e-commerce world, this was devastating: if users couldnât get to a site, they couldnât very well spend money there either. DoS attacks were the virtual equivalent of erecting a razor-wire fence around a brick-and-mortar store, except that any store could be attacked at any time, day or night.

Over the years, SYN flood attacks have been largely mitigated by improvements in Web server software and network hardware. However, lately there has been a resurgence of interest in DoS attacks within the security communityânot for âold schoolâ network-level DoS, but instead for application-level DoS and particularly for XML parser DoS.

XML DoS attacks are extremely asymmetric: to deliver the attack payload, an attacker needs to spend only a fraction of the processing power or bandwidth that the victim needs to spend to handle the payload. Worse still, DoS vulnerabilities in code that processes XML are also extremely widespread. Even if youâre using thoroughly tested parsers like those found in the Microsoft .NET Framework System.Xml classes, your code can still be vulnerable unless you take explicit steps to protect it.

This article describes some of the new XML DoS attacks. It also shows ways for you to detect potential DoS vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them in your code.

## XML Bombs

One type of especially nasty XML DoS attack is the XML bombâa block of XML that is both well-formed and valid according to the rules of an XML schema but which crashes or hangs a program when that program attempts to parse it. The best-known example of an XML bomb is probably the Exponential Entity Expansion attack.

Inside an XML document type definition (DTD), you can define your own entities, which essentially act as string substitution macros. For example, you could add this line to your DTD to replace all occurrences of the string &companyname; with âContoso Inc.â:

```
<!ENTITY companyname "Contoso Inc.">

```

You can also nest entities, like this:

```
<!ENTITY companyname "Contoso Inc.">
<!ENTITY divisionname "&companyname; Web Products Division">

```

While most developers are familiar with using external DTD files, itâs also possible to include inline DTDs along with the XML data itself. You simply define the DTD directly in the <!DOCTYPE > declaration instead of using <!DOCTYPE> to refer to an external DTD file:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE employees [
  <!ELEMENT employees (employee)*>
  <!ELEMENT employee (#PCDATA)>
  <!ENTITY companyname "Contoso Inc.">
  <!ENTITY divisionname "&companyname; Web Products Division">
]>
<employees>
  <employee>Glenn P, &divisionname;</employee>
  <employee>Dave L, &divisionname;</employee>
</employees>

```

An attacker can now take advantage of these three properties of XML (substitution entities, nested entities, and inline DTDs) to craft a malicious XML bomb. The attacker writes an XML document with nested entities just like the previous example, but instead of nesting just one level deep, he nests his entities many levels deep, as shown here:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE lolz [
  <!ENTITY lol "lol">
  <!ENTITY lol2 "&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;">
  <!ENTITY lol3 "&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;">
  <!ENTITY lol4 "&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;&lol3;">
  <!ENTITY lol5 "&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;&lol4;">
  <!ENTITY lol6 "&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;&lol5;">
  <!ENTITY lol7 "&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;&lol6;">
  <!ENTITY lol8 "&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;&lol7;">
  <!ENTITY lol9 "&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;&lol8;">
]>
<lolz>&lol9;</lolz>

```

It should be noted that this XML is both well-formed and valid according to the rules of the DTD. When an XML parser loads this document, it sees that it includes one root element, âlolzâ, that contains the text â&lol9;â. However, â&lol9;â is a defined entity that expands to a string containing ten â&lol8;â strings. Each â&lol8;â string is a defined entity that expands to ten â&lol7;â strings, and so forth. â¨After all the entity expansions have been processed, this small (< 1 KB) block of XML will actually contain a billion âlolâs, taking up almost 3GB of memory!  You can try this attack (sometimes called the Billion Laughs attack) for yourself using this very simple block of codeâjust be prepared to kill your test app process from Task Manager:

```
void processXml(string xml)
{
    System.Xml.XmlDocument document = new XmlDocument();
    document.LoadXml(xml);
}

```

Some of the more devious readers may be wondering at this point whether itâs possible to create an infinitely recursing entity expansion consisting of two entities that refer to each other:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE lolz [
  <!ENTITY lol1 "&lol2;">
  <!ENTITY lol2 "&lol1;">
]>
<lolz>&lol1;</lolz>

```

This would be a very effective attack, but fortunately it isnât legal XML and will not parse. However, another variation of the Exponential Entity Expansion XML bomb that does work is the Quadratic Blowup attack, discovered by Amit Klein of Trusteer. Instead of defining multiple small, deeply nested entities, the attacker defines one very large entity and refers to it many times:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE kaboom [
  <!ENTITY a "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...">
]>
<kaboom>&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;&a;...</kaboom>

```

If an attacker defines the entity â&a;â as 50,000 characters long, and refers to that entity 50,000 times inside the root âkaboomâ element, he ends up with an XML bomb attack payload slightly over 200 KB in size that expands to 2.5 GB when parsed. This expansion ratio is not quite as impressive as with the Exponential Entity Expansion attack, but it is still enough to take down the parsing process.

Another of Kleinâs XML bomb discoveries is the Attribute Blowup attack. Many older XML parsers, including those in the .NET Framework versions 1.0 and 1.1, parse XML attributes in an extremely inefficient quadratic O(n2) runtime. By creating an XML document with a large number of attributes (say 100,000 or more) for a single element, the XML parser will monopolize the processor for a long period of time and therefore cause a denial of service condition. However, this vulnerability has been fixed in .NET Framework versions 2.0 and later.

## External Entity Attacks

Instead of defining entity replacement strings as constants, it is also possible to define them so that their values are pulled from external URIs:

```
<!ENTITY stockprice SYSTEM    "https://www.contoso.com/currentstockprice.ashx">

```

While the exact behavior depends on the particular XML parser implementation, the intent here is that every time the XML parser encounters the entity â&stockprice;â the parser will make a request to [www.contoso.com/currentstockprice.ashx](https://www.contoso.com/currentstockprice.ashx) and then substitute the response received from that request for the stockprice entity. This is undoubtedly a cool and useful feature of XML, but it also enables some devious DoS attacks.

The simplest way to abuse the external entity functionality is to send the XML parser to a resource that will never return; that is, to send it into an infinite wait loop. For example, if an attacker had control of the server adatum.com, he could set up a generic HTTP handler file at <https://adatum.com/dos.ashx> as follows:

```
using System;
using System.Web;
using System.Threading;

public class DoS : IHttpHandler
{
    public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext context)
    {
        Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
    }

    public bool IsReusable { get { return false; } }
}

```

He could then craft a malicious entity that pointed to <https://adatum.com/dos.ashx>, and when the XML parser reads the XML file, the parser would hang. However, this is not an especially effective attack. The point of a DoS attack is to consume resources so that they are unavailable to legitimate users of the application. Our earlier examples of Exponential Entity Expansion and Quadratic Blowup XML bombs caused the server to use large amounts of memory and CPU time, but this example does not. All this attack really consumes is a single thread of execution. Letâs improve this attack (from the attackerâs perspective) by forcing the server to consume some resources:

```
public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext context)
{
    context.Response.ContentType = "text/plain";
    byte[] data = new byte[1000000];
    for (int i = 0; i < data.Length; i++) { data[i] = (byte)âAâ; }
    while (true)
    {
        context.Response.OutputStream.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
        context.Response.Flush();
    }
}

```

This code will write an infinite number of âAâ characters (one million at a time) to the response stream and chew up a huge amount of memory in a very short amount of time. If the attacker is unable or unwilling to set up a page of his own for this purposeâperhaps he doesnât want to leave a trail of evidence that points back to himâhe can instead point the external entity to a very large resource on a third-party Web site. Movie or file downloads can be especially effective for this purpose; for example, the Visual Studio 2010 Professional beta download is more than 2GB.

Yet another clever variation of this attack is to point an external entity at a target serverâs own intranet resources. Discovery of this attack technique is credited to Steve Orrin of Intel. This technique does require the attacker to have internal knowledge of intranet sites accessible by the server, but if an intranet resource attack can be executed, it can be especially effective because the server is spending its own resources (processor time, bandwidth, and memory) to attack itself or its sibling servers on the same network.

## Defending Against XML Bombs

The easiest way to defend against all types of XML entity attacks is to simply disable altogether the use of inline DTD schemas in your XML parsing objects. This is a straightforward application of the principle of attack surface reduction: if youâre not using a feature, turn it off so that attackers wonât be able to abuse it.

In .NET Framework versions 3.5 and earlier, DTD parsing behavior is controlled by the Boolean ProhibitDtd property found in the System.Xml.XmlTextReader and System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings classes. Set this value to true to disable inline DTDs completely:

```
XmlTextReader reader = new XmlTextReader(stream);
reader.ProhibitDtd = true;

```

or

```
XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();
settings.ProhibitDtd = true;
XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(stream, settings);

```

The default value of ProhibitDtd in XmlReaderSettings is true, but the default value of ProhibitDtd in XmlTextReader is false, which means that you have to explicitly set it to true to disable inline DTDs.

In .NET Framework version 4.0 (in beta at the time of this writing), DTD parsing behavior has been changed. The ProhibitDtd property has been deprecated in favor of the new DtdProcessing property. You can set this property to Prohibit (the default value) to cause the runtime to throw an exception if a <!DOCTYPE> element is present in the XML:

```
XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();
settings.DtdProcessing = DtdProcessing.Prohibit;
XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(stream, settings);

```

Alternatively, you can set the DtdProcessing property to Ignore, which will not throw an exception on encountering a <!DOCTYPE> element but will simply skip over it and not process it. Finally, you can set DtdProcessing to Parse if you do want to allow and process inline DTDs.

If you really do want to parse DTDs, you should take some additional steps to protect your code. The first step is to limit the size of expanded entities. Remember that the attacks Iâve discussed work by creating entities that expand to huge strings and force the parser to consume large amounts of memory. By setting the MaxCharactersFromEntities property of the XmlReaderSettings object, you can cap the number of characters that can be created through entity expansions. Determine a reasonable maximum and set the property accordingly. Hereâs an example:

```
XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();
settings.ProhibitDtd = false;
settings.MaxCharactersFromEntities = 1024;
XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(stream, settings);

```
## Defending Against External Entity Attacks

At this point, we have hardened this code so that it is much less vulnerable to XML bombs, but we havenât yet addressed the dangers posed by malicious external entities. You can improve your resilience against these attacks if you customize the behavior of XmlReader by changing its XmlResolver. XmlResolver objects are used to resolve external references, including external entities. XmlTextReader instances, as well as XmlReader instances returned from calls to XmlReader.Create, are prepopulated with default XmlResolvers (actually XmlUrlResolvers). You can prevent XmlReader from resolving external entities while still allowing it to resolve inline entities by setting the XmlResolver property of XmlReaderSettings to null. This is attack surface reduction at work again; if you donât need the capability, turn it off:

```
XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();
settings.ProhibitDtd = false;
settings.MaxCharactersFromEntities = 1024;
settings.XmlResolver = null;
XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(stream, settings);

```

If this situation doesnât apply to youâif you really, truly need to resolve external entitiesâall hope is not lost, but you do have a little more work to do. To make XmlResolver more resilient to denial of service attacks, you need to change its behavior in three ways. First, you need to set a request timeout to prevent infinite delay attacks. Second, you need to limit the amount of data that it will retrieve. Finally, as a defense-in-depth measure, you need to restrict the XmlResolver from retrieving resources on the local host. You can do all of this by creating a custom XmlResolver class.

The behavior that you want to modify is governed by the XmlResolver method GetEntity. Create a new class XmlSafeResolver derived from XmlUrlResolver and override the GetEntity method as follows:

```
class XmlSafeResolver : XmlUrlResolver
{
    public override object GetEntity(Uri absoluteUri, string role,
        Type ofObjectToReturn)
    {

    }
}

```

The default behavior of the XmlUrlResolver.GetEntity method looks something like the following code, which you can use as a starting point for your implementation:

```
public override object GetEntity(Uri absoluteUri, string role,
    Type ofObjectToReturn)
{
    System.Net.WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create(absoluteUri);
    System.Net.WebResponse response = request.GetResponse();
    return response.GetResponseStream();
}

```

The first change is to apply timeout values when making the request and when reading the response. Both the System.Net.WebRequest and the System.IO.Stream classes provide inherent support for timeouts. In the sample code shown in **Figure 1**, I simply hardcode the timeout value, but you could easily expose a public Timeout property on the XmlSafeResolver class if you want greater configurability.

Figure 1 Configuring Timeout Values

```
private const int TIMEOUT = 10000;  // 10 seconds

public override object GetEntity(Uri absoluteUri, string role,
   Type ofObjectToReturn)
{
    System.Net.WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create(absoluteUri);
    request.Timeout = TIMEOUT;

    System.Net.WebResponse response = request.GetResponse();
    if (response == null)
        throw new XmlException("Could not resolve external entity");

    Stream responseStream = response.GetResponseStream();
    if (responseStream == null)
        throw new XmlException("Could not resolve external entity");
    responseStream.ReadTimeout = TIMEOUT;
    return responseStream;
}

```

The next step is to cap the maximum amount of data that is retrieved in the response. Thereâs no âMaxSizeâ property or the equivalent for the Stream class, so you have to implement this functionality yourself. To do this, you can read data from the response stream one chunk at a time and copy it into a local stream cache. If the total number of bytes read from the response stream exceeds a predefined limit (again hardcoded for simplicity only), you stop reading from the stream and throw an exception (see **Figure 2**).

Figure 2 Capping the Maximum Amount of Data Retrieved

```
private const int TIMEOUT = 10000;                   // 10 seconds
private const int BUFFER_SIZE = 1024;                // 1 KB
private const int MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE = 1024 * 1024;   // 1 MB

public override object GetEntity(Uri absoluteUri, string role,
   Type ofObjectToReturn)
{
    System.Net.WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create(absoluteUri);
    request.Timeout = TIMEOUT;

    System.Net.WebResponse response = request.GetResponse();
    if (response == null)
        throw new XmlException("Could not resolve external entity");

    Stream responseStream = response.GetResponseStream();
    if (responseStream == null)
        throw new XmlException("Could not resolve external entity");
    responseStream.ReadTimeout = TIMEOUT;

    MemoryStream copyStream = new MemoryStream();
    byte[] buffer = new byte[BUFFER_SIZE];
    int bytesRead = 0;
    int totalBytesRead = 0;
    do
    {
        bytesRead = responseStream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
        totalBytesRead += bytesRead;
        if (totalBytesRead > MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE)
            throw new XmlException("Could not resolve external entity");
        copyStream.Write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
    } while (bytesRead > 0);

    copyStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
    return copyStream;
}

```

As an alternative, you can wrap the Stream class and implement the limit checking directly in the overridden Read method (see **Figure 3**). This is a more efficient implementation since you save the extra memory allocated for the cached MemoryStream in the earlier example.

Figure 3 Defining a Size-Limited Stream Wrapper Class

```
class LimitedStream : Stream
{
    private Stream stream = null;
    private int limit = 0;
    private int totalBytesRead = 0;

    public LimitedStream(Stream stream, int limit)
    {
        this.stream = stream;
        this.limit = limit;
    }

    public override int Read(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count)
    {
        int bytesRead = this.stream.Read(buffer, offset, count);
        checked { this.totalBytesRead += bytesRead; }
        if (this.totalBytesRead > this.limit)
            throw new IOException("Limit exceeded");
        return bytesRead;
    }

    ...
}

```

Now, simply wrap the stream returned from WebResponse.GetResponseStream in a LimitedStream and return the LimitedStream from the GetEntity method (see **Figure 4**).

Figure 4 Using LimitedStream in GetEntity

```
private const int TIMEOUT = 10000; // 10 seconds
private const int MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE = 1024 * 1024; // 1 MB

public override object GetEntity(Uri absoluteUri, string role, Type
ofObjectToReturn)
{
    System.Net.WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create(absoluteUri);
    request.Timeout = TIMEOUT;

    System.Net.WebResponse response = request.GetResponse();
    if (response == null)
        throw new XmlException("Could not resolve external entity");

    Stream responseStream = response.GetResponseStream();
    if (responseStream == null)
        throw new XmlException("Could not resolve external entity");
    responseStream.ReadTimeout = TIMEOUT;

    return new LimitedStream(responseStream, MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE);
}

```

Finally, add one more defense-in-depth measure by blocking entity resolution of URIs that resolve to the local host (see **Figure 5**).This includes URIs starting with https://localhost, <https://127.0.0.1>, and file:// URIs. Note that this also prevents a very nasty information disclosure vulnerability in which attackers can craft entities pointing to file://resources, the contents of which are then duly retrieved and written into the XML document by the parser.

Figure 5 Blocking Local Host Entity Resolution

```
public override object GetEntity(Uri absoluteUri, string role,
    Type ofObjectToReturn)
{
    if (absoluteUri.IsLoopback)
        return null;
    ...
}

```

Now that youâve defined a more secure XmlResolver, you need to apply it to XmlReader. Explicitly instantiate an XmlReaderSettings object, set the XmlResolver property to an instance of XmlSafeResolver, and then use the XmlReaderSettings when creating XmlReader, as shown here:

```
XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();
settings.XmlResolver = new XmlSafeResolver();
settings.ProhibitDtd = false;   // comment out if .NET 4.0 or later
settings.DtdProcessing = DtdProcessing.Parse;  // comment out if
                                               // .NET 3.5 or earlier
settings.MaxCharactersFromEntities = 1024;
XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(stream, settings);

```
## Additional Considerations

Itâs important to note that in many of the System.Xml classes, if an XmlReader is not explicitly provided to an object or a method, then one is implicitly created for it in the framework code. This implicitly created XmlReader will not have any of the additional defenses specified in this article, and it will be vulnerable to attack. The very first code snippet in this article is a great example of this behavior:

```
void processXml(string xml)
{
    System.Xml.XmlDocument document = new XmlDocument();
    document.LoadXml(xml);
}

```

This code is completely vulnerable to all the attacks described in this article. To improve this code, explicitly create an XmlReader with appropriate settings (either disable inline DTD parsing or specify a safer resolver class) and use the XmlDocument.Load(XmlReader) overload instead of XmlDocument.LoadXml or any of the other XmlDocument.Load overloads, as shown in **Figure 6**.

Figure 6 Applying Safer Entity Parsing Settings to XmlDocument

```
void processXml(string xml)
{
    MemoryStream stream =
        new MemoryStream(Encoding.Default.GetBytes(xml));
    XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings();

    // allow entity parsing but do so more safely
    settings.ProhibitDtd = false;
    settings.MaxCharactersFromEntities = 1024;
    settings.XmlResolver = new XmlSafeResolver();

    XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(stream, settings);
    XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();
    doc.Load(reader);
}

```

XLinq is somewhat safer in its default settings; the XmlReader created by default for System.Xml.Linq.XDocument does allow DTD parsing, but it automatically sets MaxCharactersFromEntities to 10,000,000 and prohibits external entity resolution. If you are explicitly providing an XmlReader to XDocument, be sure to apply the defensive settings described earlier.

## Wrapping Up

XML entity expansion is a powerful feature, but it can easily be abused by an attacker to deny service to your application. Be sure to follow the principle of attack surface reduction and disable entity expansion if you donât require its use. Otherwise, apply appropriate defenses to limit the maximum amount of time and memory your application can spend on it.
