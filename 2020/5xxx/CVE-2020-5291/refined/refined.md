Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5291:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the interaction between bubblewrap's setuid mode and the availability of unprivileged user namespaces in the kernel. When bubblewrap is installed with setuid permissions (typically done when unprivileged user namespaces are not available) and the kernel *does* support unprivileged user namespaces, the `--userns2` option allows the setuid process to continue running as root while being traceable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Privilege Dropping:** The `drop_privs` function was not correctly dropping root privileges in certain scenarios, specifically when used in conjunction with the `--userns2` option when bubblewrap is installed as setuid.
*   **Abuse of User Namespaces:** The `--userns2` option, when combined with setuid execution, can be exploited to maintain root privileges while running in a traceable context via user namespaces.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate their privileges to root. By using the `--userns2` option, they can maintain root access even after bubblewrap attempts to drop privileges, which allows for further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The attack is local. It requires a system where bubblewrap is installed with setuid permissions and the kernel supports unprivileged user namespaces, and an attacker can execute `bubblewrap` with the `--userns2` option.
*   **Command-Line Argument:** The `--userns2` command-line option is the specific mechanism used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
*   **Ability to Execute `bubblewrap`:** The attacker must be able to execute the `bubblewrap` binary.
*   **Specific System Configuration:** The system must be configured with `bubblewrap` installed in setuid mode, and the kernel must support unprivileged user namespaces.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `--userns2` option and how it interacts with setuid mode.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability only affects bubblewrap in setuid mode when unprivileged user namespaces are enabled on the system.
*   The fix involves modifying the `drop_privs` function to properly drop root privileges, specifically when `setuid` has not already been called, when using the `--userns2` option.
*   Workarounds include disabling unprivileged user namespace creation by setting `/proc/sys/user/max_user_namespaces` to 0 or setting `/proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone` to `0` if supported by the kernel.
*  The provided commit fixes the issue by adding a check to see if setuid has already been called and if it hasn't, to call it before dropping privileges when running in privileged mode.
