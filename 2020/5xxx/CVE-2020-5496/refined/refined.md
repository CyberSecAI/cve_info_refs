### CVE-2020-5496
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the `Type2NotDefSplines()` function within the `splinesave.c` file of FontForge.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow where data is written beyond the allocated memory on the heap. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running FontForge.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting the vulnerability might also result in a denial of service condition, making the application unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The attack vector is remote, implying the attacker does not need local access to the system.
*   **Specially Crafted Font File:** The attack involves enticing a user to open a maliciously crafted font file using FontForge.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Create Malicious Font Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted font file designed to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker relies on user interaction to open the malicious file with FontForge.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was found using a fuzzer, indicating that specific, possibly unusual input is needed.
*   The vulnerable function is involved in processing Type 2 PostScript fonts.
*   The issue is located in a function that handles "NotDef" splines, suggesting a potential issue with how the application deals with undefined or non-standard glyphs.

**CVSS Scores:**
*   **NVD v2:** 6.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) - Network access, Medium complexity, No authentication, Partial Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability impact
*   **NVD v3.1:** 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) - Network access, Low complexity, No privileges required, User interaction required, Unchanged Scope, High Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability impact.
*  **SUSE v3.1:** 5.4 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L) - Network access, Low complexity, Low privileges required, No User interaction required, Unchanged Scope, Low Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability impact.

The provided information from multiple sources provides comprehensive details on the vulnerability and its impact.

**Note:**  The CVSS scores vary slightly between NVD and SUSE.
