## Description

![@fcambus](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/825456?v=4&size=48)[fcambus](https://github.com/fcambus)opened [on Jan 3, 2020](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/4085#issue-545166682)

Hi,

While fuzzing FontForge with AFL, I found a heap-based buffer overflow in the Type2NotDefSplines() function, in splinesave.c.

Attaching a reproducer (gzipped so GitHub accepts it): [test02.sfd.gz](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/files/4020930/test02.sfd.gz)

Issue can be reproduced in FontForge 20190801 and with latest Git master by running:

```
fontforge -lang ff -c 'Open("test02.sfd"); Generate("test02.otf")'

```

```
