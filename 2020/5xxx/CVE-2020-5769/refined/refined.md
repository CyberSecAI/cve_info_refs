Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-5769:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is insufficient output sanitization in the Teltonika firmware. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary client-side code within the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Stealing of session cookies/tokens, potentially allowing the attacker to impersonate legitimate users.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacement of the web interface

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into the 'URL/ Host / Connection' form within the 'DATA TO SERVER' configuration section of the Teltonika firmware's web UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Remote:** The attacker can be located remotely.
-   **Authenticated:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to access and modify the router's web interface.
-   **Low Privileges:** The attacker can have low-level privileges to still perform the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is persistent/stored XSS since the injected script is stored within the application and executed each time the page is loaded.
- The vulnerability affects Teltonika firmware version `TRB2_R_00.02.02`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in firmware version `TRB2_R_00.02.03`.
