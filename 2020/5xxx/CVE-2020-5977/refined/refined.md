Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-5977:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA Web Helper NodeJS Web Server component of NVIDIA GeForce Experience.
- An uncontrolled search path is used when loading a node module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled search path for loading node modules. This means the application does not properly validate the locations from which modules are loaded, potentially leading it to load malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code Execution: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the system.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability could be exploited to cause a denial of service.
- Escalation of Privileges: It could allow an attacker to gain higher privileges than intended.
- Information Disclosure: Sensitive information could be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required (AV:L).
- Low attack complexity (AC:L).
- The attacker needs low privileges on the system (PR:L).
- User interaction is required (UI:R).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to have some level of privileges on the system.
- The attacker must induce the user to take some action (user interaction).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is rated with a base score of 8.2 with a CVSS vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H which represents high impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- The vulnerability affects all versions of GeForce Experience prior to 3.20.5.70
- This vulnerability was reported by Xavier DANEST of Decathlon and Boris Ryutin.
