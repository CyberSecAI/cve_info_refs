Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-5655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a NULL Pointer Dereference in the TCP/IP stack of the affected MELSEC iQ-R series modules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can send specially crafted packets to trigger a NULL pointer dereference.
- This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, potentially halting the network functions of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is network-based, exploiting the TCP/IP stack.
- The attacker sends specially crafted packets over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected device.
- No special privileges or user interaction is required.

**Affected Products (with serial number specifics):**
The following MELSEC iQ-R series modules are affected:
- MELSEC iQ-R Series EtherNet/IP Network Interface Module: RJ71EIP91 (Serial No. first 2 digits "02" or less)
- MELSEC iQ-R Series PROFINET IO Controller Module: RJ71PN92 (Serial No. first 2 digits "01" or less)
- MELSEC iQ-R Series High Speed Data Logger Module: RD81DL96 (Serial No. first 2 digits "08" or less)
- MELSEC iQ-R Series MES Interface Module: RD81MES96N (Serial No. first 2 digits "04" or less)
- MELSEC iQ-R Series OPC UA Server Module: RD81OPC96 (Serial No. first 2 digits "04" or less)

**Mitigation:**
- Update the firmware of the affected modules to the versions specified in the document, where the first 2 digits of the serial number are greater than the specified number.
- Restrict access to the devices from trusted networks and hosts.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is one of several found in the TCP/IP stack of the mentioned modules.
- The base CVSS score for this specific vulnerability is 7.5.
