Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-5780:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication for a critical function within the WordPress Email Subscribers & Newsletters plugin by Icegram. Specifically, the `class-es-newsletters.php` class is affected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The plugin does not properly authenticate requests to a key function, allowing unauthenticated users to interact with it.
*   **Email Forgery/Spoofing:**  The lack of authentication enables attackers to send emails with arbitrary content and subjects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Email Spoofing:** An attacker can send emails that appear to originate from the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **Phishing and Malicious Campaigns:** Attackers could leverage the vulnerability to send phishing emails or distribute malicious content to subscribers or contacts.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  The legitimate site's reputation could be harmed by malicious emails sent through it.
*  **Loss of Trust:** Users may lose trust in the site if they receive unexpected or malicious emails originating from it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any existing access to the WordPress site.
*   **Crafted AJAX Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited using a specifically crafted AJAX request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP POST request to exploit the vulnerability.
* **No Prior Knowledge Required:** The attacker does not require any user-level access, prior knowledge of site users, or list IDs since they can be enumerated.

**Technical Details (from the provided PoC):**

*   The provided POST request shows how the attacker sets the `action` parameter to `admin_init`, and crafts data for a new broadcast, including a `subject`, `body`, and `list_ids`, as well as setting the `scheduling_option` to `schedule_now`, to trigger the immediate sending of the forged email.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability allows the attacker to send emails to *all* recipients in the available lists of contacts or subscribers
* The crafted request tricks the application into creating a new broadcast and schedule a greeting email that gets sent immediately or after a short delay.
