Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5392:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** issue within the Auth0 WordPress plugin's settings page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input on the settings page before storing it in the database. This allows a malicious actor to inject JavaScript code into the settings that will then be executed by other users' browsers when they visit the settings page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code. When a user, especially an administrator, visits the affected settings page, the injected code will execute within their browser. This allows the attacker to perform various malicious actions including, but not limited to:
    *   Stealing session cookies, leading to account takeover.
    *   Redirecting users to phishing sites.
    *   Modifying content on the settings page.
    *   Performing administrative actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via the WordPress admin settings page of the Auth0 plugin.
*   A malicious user, or an attacker who has compromised an account with access to plugin settings, can inject the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have write access to the WordPress plugin settings or be able to trick an administrator into inputting the malicious script. This typically means having administrative-level access to the WordPress dashboard or exploiting another vulnerability to achieve this.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Auth0 security bulletin lists this CVE alongside others in the same plugin, indicating a general lack of input sanitization and security checks in earlier versions of the plugin.
*   The recommended fix is to upgrade to version 4.0.0 or higher of the WordPress Plugin for Auth0.
