Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the "package" parameter within the `opkg_remove` function located in `/usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/packages.lua`. This function is responsible for removing packages, but it doesn't verify if the provided package parameter points to a valid package file or performs any sanitization on the input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The lack of validation allows an attacker to use relative path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../..`) in the "package" parameter to navigate outside of the intended package directory structure and target arbitrary files.
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Due to the ability to traverse the file system, the attacker can specify any file on the system, and the `opkg remove` function will attempt to delete it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete critical system files, potentially rendering the device inoperable. This is demonstrated with a proof-of-concept where `/etc/passwd` deletion is used as an example, which leads to device inaccessibility.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Deleting core system files can cause the device to become unstable or unusable, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface of the device, making it accessible over the network.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/luci/admin/services/packages/remove`, with the malicious directory traversal in the "package" parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user in the admin group to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Teltonika TRB245 device's web interface.
