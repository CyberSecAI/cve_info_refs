Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2020-5226.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper output sanitization in the error reporting feature of SimpleSAMLphp. Specifically, when an error report is submitted, the free-text explanation provided by the user is included in the email sent to the system administrator. In versions 1.18.0 to 1.18.3, the manual escaping of this free-text field was removed, and although Twig templates would have provided automatic escaping, an alternative, hardcoded PHP email template that lacked escaping was used. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML into the error report email.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability through HTML injection in the free-text field of error reports.
- Lack of input sanitization or output encoding in the PHP email template.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could craft a malicious email using the error reporting mechanism. This crafted email could potentially trick a system administrator into performing unintended actions, such as entering their credentials on a phishing website that mimics the original. While direct JavaScript execution in most email clients is unlikely, the potential for phishing attacks exists.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious error report by filling the free text field with HTML code.
- The attack is initiated when an administrator receives and views the crafted email.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the error reporting form of SimpleSAMLphp.
- The attacker must have the ability to craft and submit error reports with arbitrary HTML code in the free-text field.
