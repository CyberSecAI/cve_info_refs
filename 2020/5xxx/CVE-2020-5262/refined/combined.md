[EasyBuild](https://easybuild.io) is a software build
and installation framework that allows you to manage (scientific) software
on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems in an efficient way.

The **easybuild-framework** package is the core of EasyBuild. It
supports the implementation and use of so-called easyblocks which
implement the software install procedure for a particular (group of) software
package(s).

The EasyBuild documentation is available at <http://docs.easybuild.io/>.

The EasyBuild framework source code is hosted on GitHub, along
with an issue tracker for bug reports and feature requests, see
<https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework>.

  + GitHub repository: <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks>
  + package on PyPi: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/easybuild-easyblocks>
* **easybuild-easyconfigs**
  + a collection of example easyconfig files that specify which software to build,
    and using which build options; these easyconfigs will be well tested
    with the latest compatible versions of the easybuild-framework and easybuild-easyblocks packages

# GitHub personal access token leaking into temporary EasyBuild (debug) logs

Moderate

[wpoely86](/wpoely86)
published
GHSA-2wx6-wc87-rmjm
Mar 19, 2020

## Package

easybuild-framework
(PyPI)

## Affected versions

< 4.1.2

## Patched versions

4.1.2

## Description

### Impact

The GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) used by EasyBuild for the GitHub integration features (like `--new-pr`, `--from-pr`, etc.) is shown in plain text in EasyBuild debug log files.

Scope:

* the log message only appears in the top-level log file, *not* in the individual software installation logs (see <https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Logfiles.html>);
  + as a consequence, tokens are *not* included in the partial log files that are uploaded into a gist when using `--upload-test-report` in combination with `--from-pr`, nor in the installation logs that are copied to the software installation directories;
* the message is only logged when using `--debug`, so it will not appear when using the default EasyBuild configuration (only info messages are logged by default);
* the log message is triggered via `--from-pr`, but also via various other GitHub integration options like `--new-pr`, `--merge-pr`, `--close-pr`, etc., but usually only appears in the temporary log file that is cleaned up automatically as soon as eb completes successfully;
* you may have several debug log files that include your GitHub token in `/tmp` (or a different location if you've set the `--tmpdir` EasyBuild configuration option) on the systems where you use EasyBuild, but they are located in a subdirectory that is only accessible to your account (permissions set to 700);
* the only way that a log file that may include your token could have been made public is *if you shared it yourself*, for example by copying the contents of the log file into a gist manually, or by sending a log file to someone;
* for log files uploaded to GitHub, your token would be revoked automatically when GitHub notices it;

### Patches

The issue is fixed with the changes in [#3248](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/3248).

This fix is included in EasyBuild v4.1.2 (released on Mon Mar 16th 2020), and in the `master`+ `develop` branches of the `easybuild-framework` repository since Mon Mar 16th 2020 (see [#3248](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/3248) and [#3249](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/3249) resp.).

**Make sure you revoke the existing GitHub tokens you're using with EasyBuild** (via <https://github.com/settings/tokens>), and install new ones using "`eb --install-github-token --force`" (see also <https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Integration_with_GitHub.html#installing-a-github-token-install-github-token>).

### Workarounds

* avoid using the GitHub integration features (see <https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Integration_with_GitHub.html>) with EasyBuild versions older than version 4.1.2;
* don't share top-level EasyBuild (debug) log files with others, unless you are sure your GitHub token is not included in them;
* clean up temporary EasyBuild log files in `/tmp`on the system(s) where you`re using EasyBuild

### References

* [#3248](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/3248) (PR that fixes the issue)
* (release announcement to EasyBuild mailing list)

### @boegel **[boegel](/boegel)** commented [Mar 16, 2020](#issue-582147304) • edited Loading

GitHub tokens were found to be "leaking" into the top-level log file when using `--from-pr` combined with `--debug`, as reported by [@zao](https://github.com/zao):

```
# relevant part of log for "eb --from-pr 10064 --debug"
== 2020-03-15 19:15:28,551 github.py:389 DEBUG Fetching easyconfigs from easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs PR #10064 into /tmp/eb-nqIFwJ/files_pr10064

== 2020-03-15 19:15:30,188 rest.py:207 DEBUG opening request:  https://api.github.com/repos/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pulls/10064
== 2020-03-15 19:15:30,691 rest.py:177 DEBUG reponse len: 46

```

That's clearly not desirable, so the changes in this PR censor the `Authorization` part of the headers before the debug log statement.

To clarify the scope of this a bit:

* the log message only appears in the top-level log file, not in the individual software installation logs (see <https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Logfiles.html>);

  + as a consequence, tokens are *not* included in the partial log files that are uploaded into a gist when using `--upload-test-report` in combination with `--from-pr`, nor in the installation logs that are copied to the software installation directories;
* the message is only logged when using `--debug`, so it will not appear when using the default EasyBuild configuration (only `info` messages are logged by default);
* the log message is triggered via `--from-pr`, but also via various other GitHub integration options like `--new-pr`, `--merge-pr`, `--close-pr`, etc., but usually only appears in the temporary log file that is cleaned up automatically as soon as `eb` completes successfully;
* you may have several debug log files that include your GitHub token in `/tmp` (or a different location if you've set the `--tmpdir` EasyBuild configuration option) on the systems where you use EasyBuild, but they are located in a subdirectory that is only accessible to your account (permissions set to 700);
* the only way that a log file that may include your token could have been made public is if you shared it yourself, for example by copying the contents of the log file into a gist manually, or by sending a log file to someone;
* for log files uploaded to GitHub, your token would be revoked automatically when GitHub notices it (which is what happened to [@zao](https://github.com/zao))

**We strongly encourage that you revoke the GitHub tokens you are using currently, via <https://github.com/settings/tokens>, and to replace them using a new token (using `eb --install-github-token --force`).**

(this PR also includes the fixes from [#3212](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/3212) and [#3226](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/3226) which is required to get the full test suite to pass)

Sorry, something went wrong.
