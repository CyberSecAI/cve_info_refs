Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `/external_content/retrieve/oembed` route of Canvas LMS.
- The `oembed_retrieve` method in `external_content_controller` takes an `endpoint` parameter and a `url` parameter.
- It constructs a URI using the `endpoint` and `url` parameters and then uses `CanvasHttp.get()` to make an HTTP GET request to the constructed URI, without proper validation of the `endpoint` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application makes an HTTP GET request to a URL controlled by an attacker.
- The `url` parameter allows for arbitrary content in the query string of the request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause the Canvas LMS application to make HTTP GET requests to arbitrary domains.
- This can be used to scan internal networks (if the Canvas LMS server is internal), exfiltrate data from internal resources (if accessible) or potentially perform other attacks.
- Although the provided exploit only includes a GET request, additional attack vectors might be present if any other request methods could be made.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is initiated by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint: `/external_content/retrieve/oembed` with attacker-controlled `endpoint` and `url` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Canvas LMS application. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
