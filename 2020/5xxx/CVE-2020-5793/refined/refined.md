Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-5793:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Nessus and Nessus Agent handle user-supplied files on Windows systems. Specifically, the applications allow a local, authenticated attacker to copy these files to a specially crafted path within a user's directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure File Handling:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of paths and file names when handling user-supplied files, leading to a file copy vulnerability.
- **Path Manipulation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to control the destination path for the copied file through a specially constructed path, allowing them to place it in a sensitive system directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By placing a malicious file in a system directory and potentially leveraging other vulnerabilities or configuration weaknesses, the attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the targeted system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although the vulnerability requires local access, it could be used as a step in a more complex attack to gain higher privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have a valid account on the Windows system running the vulnerable Nessus or Nessus Agent versions.
- **Malicious File:** The attacker crafts a malicious file, that is then copied to a specific location by the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs valid credentials for a local user account on the target Windows system.
- **Local System Access:** The attacker must have the ability to interact with the file system of the target system.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of this specific vulnerability and the required steps for exploitation.

**Affected Products & Versions**
- Nessus versions 8.9.0 through 8.12.0 for Windows
- Nessus Agent 8.0.0 and 8.1.0 for Windows

**Mitigation**
- Upgrade to Nessus 8.12.1 or later
- Upgrade Nessus Agent to 8.2.0 or 8.1.1 or later
