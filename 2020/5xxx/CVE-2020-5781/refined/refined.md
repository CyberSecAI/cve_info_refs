Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-5781:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `langSelection` parameter, which is stored in the `/etc/config/luci` configuration file by the `authenticator.htmlauth` function, does not properly sanitize user-provided input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Arbitrary JavaScript can be injected into the `langSelection` parameter.
- **Denial-of-service (DoS):** The injected JavaScript causes the web interface to become unusable for all logged-in users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  **Denial of Service:** The web interface becomes completely unusable due to the injected JavaScript, preventing users from interacting with the device through the web UI.
-  **Account Lockout:** Users are unable to log in to the device until the malicious configuration is manually removed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through a crafted HTTP request that sets the `langSelection` parameter.
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid user credentials to log in to the affected device.
- The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by making a crafted HTTP request with the malicious payload in the `langSelection` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability exists within the authentication process.
- The vulnerability allows for persistent XSS, as the malicious code is stored in a configuration file, affecting all subsequent users of the web UI.
- The vulnerability can be triggered via the following URL (assuming credentials and IP address are correct):
  `http://<host>/cgi-bin/acn?username=root&login_msg=&password=admin123&langSelection=<script>alert('1337+hacks')</script>`
