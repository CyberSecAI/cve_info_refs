Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-5764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal flaw within the MX Transfer feature of the MX Player Android application, specifically when the user is in "Receive" mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Directory Traversal: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal characters (`../`) within the "name" field of a "FILE_LIST" MessageType. This enables the attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the victim's device, outside the intended `/sdcard/MXshare` directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Write: An attacker can write files to locations outside the intended directory.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): In some instances, by writing specifically crafted `.odex` and `.vdex` files to the application's `oat` directory, an attacker can achieve remote code execution the next time the application is started.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to connect to the MX Transfer session of the victim's device as a "sender".
- The attacker must send a `MessageType` of `FILE_LIST`.
- The `name` field in the `FILE_LIST` message must include directory traversal characters (`../`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network or otherwise able to connect to the MX Transfer session started by a user with the MX Player application in "Receive" mode.
- No special privileges are required to send the crafted `FILE_LIST` message.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects MX Player Android App versions prior to v1.24.5.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Tenable.
- A proof-of-concept exploit is available on GitHub.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8, rated as "High."
- The vulnerability is addressed in MX Player v1.24.5 and later.
