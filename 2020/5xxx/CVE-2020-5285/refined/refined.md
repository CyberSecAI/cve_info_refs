Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5285:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `PathWithBackUrlExtension` in PrestaShop, specifically how it handles the `back-url` parameter in URLs. The extension was introduced in commit `afa2844` and the fix was applied in commit `b6aea15`. The `getPathWithBackUrl` method would directly use the URL provided in the `back-url` parameter without proper sanitization when generating links, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the lack of sanitization of the `back-url` parameter. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `back-url` parameter. When a user clicks on the generated link containing the malicious payload in the back parameter, the injected script executes in the user's browser, leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Execution of Malicious Scripts:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal session cookies, leading to account compromise.
- **Phishing:** The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious site or display deceptive content.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could manipulate the displayed content within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a URL with a malicious script in the `back-url` parameter.
- **User Interaction:** The victim clicks on the manipulated link, which triggers the execution of the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to craft URLs with the vulnerable `back-url` parameter.
- **Social Engineering/Phishing:** The attacker may need to entice the victim to click on the malicious link, possibly through social engineering or other phishing techniques.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code was introduced in commit `afa2844` and fixed in commit `b6aea15`.
- The fix involved removing the `is_safe_callback` option and relying on auto-escaping the extensionâ€™s result.
- The vulnerability affects PrestaShop versions up to 1.7.6.0 and is fixed in 1.7.6.5.
- This is a reflected XSS vulnerability, meaning the malicious script is not stored in the server.
