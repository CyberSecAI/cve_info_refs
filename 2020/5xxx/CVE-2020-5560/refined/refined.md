Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5560:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an OS command injection flaw in the WL-Enq (WEB Enquete) software. This means that the application allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in OS commands, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary OS Command Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user. This could potentially give an attacker full control over the affected system.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The vulnerability can lead to complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction to some degree (UI:R) according to CVSS v3, which can be interpreted as either user interaction being required to trigger the vulnerability, or that a user needs to use the affected software in a way that exposes the vulnerability (i.e., filling out and submitting a web form).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication:** No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N).
- **Exploitable via Web Interface:** The vulnerability is present in a CGI application used for web questionnaires.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was confirmed on WL-Enq version 1.12, however, the affected version is 1.11.
- The vendor is unreachable and no mitigations were available at the time of disclosure.
- The vulnerability was verified by the IPA on October 16, 2019 using a CentOS 7.6 server with Apache 2.4.16, PHP 5.4.16, and the vulnerable software.
- The vulnerability is severe, with a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8, and CVSS v2 base score of 6.8.
- The software allows copying, revising, and distribution which makes it difficult to contact all users of the software.
