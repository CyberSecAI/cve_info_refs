{
  "CVE-2020-5312": {
    "Description": "A flaw was discovered in python-pillow that does not properly restrict operations within the bounds of a memory buffer when decoding PCX images. An application that uses python-pillow to decode untrusted images may be vulnerable to this flaw, which can allow an attacker to crash the application or potentially execute code on the system.",
    "Root cause": "Improperly restricted operations on memory buffer in libImaging/PcxDecode.c",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could cause a denial of service (crash the application) or potentially execute arbitrary code on the system.",
    "Attack vectors": "Processing specially crafted PCX image files",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to provide a malicious PCX file to be processed by python-pillow."
