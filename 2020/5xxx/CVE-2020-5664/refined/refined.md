- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application deserializes untrusted data, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, likely involving sending crafted serialized data to the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  No authentication is required (PR:N) to exploit this vulnerability, but it requires high complexity (AC:H) .
