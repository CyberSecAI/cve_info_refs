Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-5267:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient escaping of specific characters within the `j` and `escape_javascript` helper methods in ActionView, a component of the Ruby on Rails framework. Specifically, the dollar sign `$` and backtick `` ` `` characters were not being escaped properly when used in JavaScript string literals.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The core vulnerability is XSS. By not escaping `$` and `` ` `` characters, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
*   **Data Theft, Session Hijacking, Defacement:** This could lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing user credentials or sensitive data, hijacking user sessions, defacing websites, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Input Injection:** The primary attack vector involves injecting malicious input into a web application that uses the vulnerable `j` or `escape_javascript` helper methods. This input could come from various sources, including URL parameters, form data, or data stored in the database.
*   **Vulnerable Code:** Applications using the vulnerable methods to output user-controlled data into JavaScript contexts are at risk.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject Malicious Input:** An attacker needs to be able to inject specific characters (`$` or `` ` ``) into a website's input fields or any other data source that is processed by the vulnerable code.
*   **Target Application using Vulnerable Code:**  The target application must be using the vulnerable `j` or `escape_javascript` methods to render JavaScript string literals with user-controlled content.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs within the `actionview/lib/action_view/helpers/javascript_helper.rb` file in Rails.
*   The fix involves adding `$` and `` ` `` to the `JS_ESCAPE_MAP` hash and updating the regular expression within the `escape_javascript` method to include these characters.
*   The following code snippets highlight the change in the `javascript_helper.rb` file:
