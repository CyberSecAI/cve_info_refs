Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-5353:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect default permissions in the Network File System (NFS) configuration of Dell EMC Isilon OneFS and Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS. Specifically, the default configuration allows access to an 'admin' home directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Default Permissions:** The system's default NFS configuration grants unintended access to the 'admin' home directory.
- **UID Spoofing:** An attacker can leverage a spoofed Unique Identifier (UID) over NFS to gain unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can rewrite sensitive files by exploiting the incorrect permissions and UID spoofing vulnerability.
- This could allow an attacker to gain administrative access to the system.
- The impact is classified as high with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8, indicating high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network File System (NFS): The attack is carried out over the NFS protocol.
- UID Spoofing: The attacker spoofs a UID to gain unauthorized access to files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker must be able to spoof UIDs over NFS.
- The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) to execute the attack.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

- Dell EMC Isilon OneFS versions 8.2.2 and earlier
- Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS version 9.0.0

**Remediation:**

- **Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS version 9.0.0:** The fix is included in the release.
- **Dell EMC Isilon OneFS versions 8.2.2, 8.2.1 and 8.1.2:** The fix is included in the June 2020 (for 8.2.2) or May 2020 (for 8.2.1 and 8.1.2) Rollup Patch, and all future Rollup Patches.

**Workarounds:**

- Disable NFS.
- Move the admin home directory.
- Enable Kerberos authentication.
