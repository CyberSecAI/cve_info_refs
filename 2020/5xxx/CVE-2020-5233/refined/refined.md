Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5233:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of redirect URLs in the `oauth2_proxy` application. Specifically, the application did not properly handle redirect URLs containing the sequence "/\", which allowed for bypassing of the intended redirect URL whitelisting mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Open Redirect:** The core issue is an open redirect vulnerability. The application takes a user-provided URL and redirects the user to it without proper validation.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application failed to sanitize or validate the redirect URL adequately, specifically when the URL contained "/\".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers could craft malicious links that use the vulnerable redirect functionality to redirect users to phishing sites.
*   **OAuth Token Harvesting:** By exploiting the open redirect vulnerability in combination with OAuth flows, attackers could redirect users to attacker-controlled domains after the user authenticates, allowing the attacker to harvest OAuth tokens and potentially gain unauthorized access to the user's accounts on the application being protected by `oauth2_proxy`.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers could use harvested tokens to impersonate users and potentially gain access to their accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Maliciously Crafted URLs:** Attackers can construct URLs with a specific format, using "/\" within the redirect URL, to redirect users to any arbitrary domain.
*   **OAuth Redirection:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability during the OAuth process by manipulating the `redirect_uri` parameter, and combining the open redirect to successfully redirect users to attacker controlled domains.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the `oauth2_proxy` application.
*   **Understanding of OAuth Flows:** To exploit the vulnerability for OAuth token harvesting, the attacker needs to understand how the OAuth flow works and how the `redirect_uri` parameter can be manipulated.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability was located in the `IsValidRedirect` function within `oauthproxy.go`. The original logic checked if the provided redirect URL started with "/" but did not account for the "/\" sequence, which was being interpreted as a valid absolute path.

**Patch:**
The fix involved adding an extra check within the `IsValidRedirect` function to explicitly disallow redirect URLs that started with "/\", thus preventing the bypass of the intended validation.
