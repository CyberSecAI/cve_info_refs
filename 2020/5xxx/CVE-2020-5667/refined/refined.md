Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5667:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Studyplus App for Android and iOS included a hard-coded API key for an external service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Hard-coded credentials (CWE-798): The API key was directly embedded within the application's code or data, rather than being stored securely or retrieved from a secure source.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of the API key: An attacker could extract the hard-coded API key by analyzing the application's data.
- Potential access to external service: Obtaining the API key could grant access to the external service, possibly leading to unauthorized use of the service or the exposure of data associated with the service, but the content states "a user is not directly affected by this vulnerability." However, the CVSS score suggests there is some confidentiality impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to have access to the application's files or data on the device.
- Application analysis: The attacker analyzes the application's code or data to extract the API key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to access and analyze the application's files. This would generally mean having the app installed and being able to pull the files from the device, or obtaining the application's APK/IPA from a third party.
- Reverse engineering skills to analyze the application's data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The API key was inactivated by the vendor. This means that while the vulnerability existed, it can no longer be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the external service.
- The vulnerability is present in Studyplus App for Android v6.3.7 and earlier, and Studyplus App for iOS v8.29.0 and earlier.
- The vendor has released updated versions of the application that do not contain the hard-coded API key.
- CVSS v3 base score of 4.0 (Medium) and CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 (Medium).
- The vulnerability was reported to IPA by Ryo Sato of BroadBand Security,Inc.
