Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-5263:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `auth0.js` library including the user's original request, potentially containing the plaintext password, within the error object returned during authentication failures. This error object could be exposed or logged without proper sanitization, leading to a risk of password exposure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of sensitive information (plaintext passwords) within error objects.
*   **Lack of Sanitization:** The library does not mask or filter out sensitive data before including it in the error response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Exposure:** If the error object is logged or exposed without modification, an attacker could potentially gain access to users' passwords.
*   **Compromised User Accounts:** Exposed passwords can be used to compromise user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Error Logging:** An attacker may gain access to exposed passwords via application logs where error objects are stored without sanitization.
*   **Error Display:** An attacker may gain access to exposed passwords via error messages displayed to end users, potentially during debugging or other development-related activities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Logs/Error Output:** The attacker would need access to locations where the error objects are being stored (e.g., application logs) or displayed (e.g., error messages).

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions 8.0.0 to 9.13.1 (inclusive) of the `auth0.js` library are affected.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 9.13.2, where user-inputted passwords are masked in errors.
*   **Mitigation:** If upgrading is not immediately possible, developers should avoid storing or publicly displaying error objects without filtering out sensitive information. The patch for this vulnerability modifies the error object to mask password values with "\*\*\*\*\*".
*   The fix introduces a new helper function `updatePropertyOn` which is used to mask the password.
