- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect handling of redirects in Reactor Netty HttpClient, leading to potential credential leakage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The HttpClient, when configured to follow redirects, might send authentication credentials to a different domain than intended.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Sensitive credentials could be leaked to an attacker-controlled domain if a redirect occurs to that domain. This could result in unauthorized access and further malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the HttpClient is configured to follow redirects and then encounters a redirect to a different domain.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to control a domain that can be redirected to from a vulnerable application using a vulnerable version of Reactor Netty HttpClient. The application must also be explicitly configured to follow redirects.
