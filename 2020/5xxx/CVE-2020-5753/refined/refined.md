Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-5753

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Signal's implementation of WebRTC handles ICE Candidates during call setup, specifically before a call is answered or declined.  A remote attacker can force the victim's device to resolve a domain name during the signaling process by including a malicious domain in the ICE candidate exchange. If the attacker controls the authoritative nameserver for the domain they include, they can then determine the victim's current DNS server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure:  The application discloses the currently used DNS server.
- WebRTC ICE Candidate Handling: The vulnerability is specifically in how WebRTC ICE candidates are processed.
- Lack of Proper Sanitization: The application does not sanitize or prevent the inclusion of arbitrary domains in the ICE candidate exchange.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Disclosure of DNS server IP address: An attacker can obtain the IP address of the victim's currently used DNS server.
- Possible Location and Network Disclosure: Knowing the DNS server can reveal coarse location information and changes in internet connections.
-  Potential disclosure of part of the Signal user's IP address when EDNS Client Subnet is used. This results in more specific location and network information being exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, non-contact attack: A remote attacker who is not in the victim's contact list can exploit the vulnerability.
- Signal Calling System: The vulnerability is exploited through the Signal calling system.
- Malicious ICE Candidate: Attackers include a malicious domain in the ICE candidate exchange of an incoming call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Connectivity: The attacker needs to be able to initiate a call to the victim using Signal.
- Control of Authoritative Nameserver: The attacker needs to own or control the authoritative nameserver for the domain used in the malicious ICE candidate.
- No prior contact: The attacker does not need to be in the victim's contact list.

**Vulnerable Versions:**
- Signal Private Messenger Android v4.59.0 and up, including v4.58.10.
- Signal Private Messenger iOS v3.8.1.5 and up, including v3.8.0.34 and up to v3.8.3.5

**Patched Versions:**
- Signal Android to version 4.59.11 or later.
- Signal iOS to version 3.8.4 or later.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists because WebRTC's use of domain names in ICE candidates allows an attacker to trigger DNS lookups on the victim's device before a call is answered.
- This vulnerability can be mitigated by setting "Always Relay Calls", however this setting is not enabled by default.
