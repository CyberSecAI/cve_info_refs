The provided content describes SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the "Online-food-ordering-system" project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application directly includes external parameters from HTTP GET requests into SQL queries without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection. The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `status` parameter in `all-tickets.php` and the `id` parameter in `view-ticket.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially manipulate the SQL queries to bypass authentication, extract sensitive information, modify data, or perform other malicious actions on the database.

**Attack vectors:**
By crafting malicious input in the `status` parameter of `all-tickets.php` or the `id` parameter of `view-ticket.php`, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application with the manipulated parameters.
