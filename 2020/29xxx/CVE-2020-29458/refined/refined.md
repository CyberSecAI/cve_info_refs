```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can modify site settings by forging requests, potentially leading to defacement, data manipulation, or other unauthorized actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that submits a request to the vulnerable application. If an authenticated user visits this page, their browser will automatically send the forged request to the application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the user with an active authenticated session visit a malicious webpage. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves. The attacker must be able to trick a user into visiting the page."
