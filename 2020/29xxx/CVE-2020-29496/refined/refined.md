- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input sanitization when creating a new end user allows the storage of malicious HTML or JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: When victim users access the stored malicious data, the malicious code will be executed by the web browser in the context of the vulnerable application. This can lead to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote authenticated attacker with high privileges can inject malicious code into the 'Enduser' creation process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a remote authenticated user with high privileges within the Dell Wyse Management Suite.
