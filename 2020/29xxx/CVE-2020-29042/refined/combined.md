Pre-release

Pre-release

In this beta we have included various LiveKit fixes (still experimental), introduced an S3 based cache for presentation assets and relocated the welcome message (so it's no longer in the chat area but in a dialog triggered via the meeting name). Many thanks to [@schrd](https://github.com/schrd) for adding the scalability enhancement of being able to run more than one instance of Hasura! Load testing during the summit led to the discovery and fixes of several middleware items thus improving the stability.

Various fixes to both client and server side, and stability improvements also were included.

Below is a list of the pull requests in this iteration, grouped by component.

Note that BigBlueButton 3.0-dev runs on Ubuntu Jammy (22.04).

BigBlueButton 3.0-dev is under active development. While we don’t recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on our [bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).

Link to installation command / instructions/ schedule / planned features : <https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/3.0/new-features>

All fixes from BigBlueButton 2.7.x are here up to and including v2.7.16 (.2 onwards have been manually ported as we no longer merge the 2.7 branch directly into the 3.0 branch).

Big THANK YOU to all comminuty members who helped for this release - both through sending pull requests and through reporting bugs or requesting enhancements! 🎊

If for some reason you would like to install this specific release, pass `-v focal-270-2.7.16`.

We still recommend using `-v focal-270` as this repository is continually updated with each BigBlueButton 2.7 release.

Pre-release

Pre-release

Quite a few impactful changes in this beta!

We have enabled by default the recent chat enhancements (edit, delete, reply, react)

as we now handle them in recordings (playback format, not in video yet).

LiveKit support saw major work included too. Custom logout urls can be passed on join for each user now (Thanks [@jaapjansma](https://github.com/jaapjansma) !). Webcam mirroring is enabled by default. Presenter changes now result in a system message in the chat too. This is handy specifically for breakout rooms where young participants may be tempted to cause disruptions.

The whiteboard saw stability improvements and simplification in its tools panels. The options button is no longer in the way and commonly known shortcut buttons have now been omitted (undo, redo, duplicate).

In terms of the underlying software, we opted to rely on Postgres 14 (matching what Ubuntu 22.04 comes with) and have removed the upstream postgresql source from bbb-install. New installations will only have postgresql-14. Older installations will still be functional but consider removing postgresql different than 14 (or postgresql config overrides will not take effect).

Various fixes to both client and server side, and stability improvements also were included.

Below is a list of the pull requests in this iteration, grouped by component.

Note that BigBlueButton 3.0-dev runs on Ubuntu Jammy (22.04).

BigBlueButton 3.0-dev is under active development. While we don’t recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on our [bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).

Link to installation command / instructions/ schedule / planned features : <https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/3.0/new-features>

All fixes from BigBlueButton 2.7.x are here up to and including v2.7.15 (.2 onwards have been manually ported as we no longer merge the 2.7 branch directly into the 3.0 branch).

Big THANK YOU to all comminuty members who helped for this release - both through sending pull requests and through reporting bugs or requesting enhancements! 🎊

Pre-release

In this iteration we have included various fixes to both client and server side. Plugin manifests can now be pulled asyncronously on meeting create. A configuration was added for the maximum allowed number of participants in multi user whiteboard. The whiteboard annotations history usage has been reworked leading to a noticeable reduction in payload sizes.

Below is a list of the pull requests in this iteration, grouped by component.

Note that BigBlueButton 3.0-dev runs on Ubuntu Jammy (22.04).

BigBlueButton 3.0-dev is under active development. While we don’t recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on our [bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).

Link to installation command / instructions/ schedule / planned features : <https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/3.0/new-features>

All fixes from BigBlueButton 2.7.x are here up to and including v2.7.15 (.2 onwards have been manually ported as we no longer merge the 2.7 branch directly into the 3.0 branch).

Pre-release

Pre-release

In this iteration we have included various passable parameters and plugin hooks to help BigBlueButton support wider spectrum of use cases. Multiple fixes are also included. Chat messages improvements like threads, editing, reactions and moderating were merged but are not enabled by default yet (some work remains for recording, documenting etc). Expect more updates in that area in the next beta.

Below is a list of the pull requests in this iteration, grouped by component.

Note that BigBlueButton 3.0-dev runs on Ubuntu Jammy (22.04).

BigBlueButton 3.0-dev is under active development. While we don’t recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on our [bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).

Link to installation command / instructions/ schedule / planned features : <https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/3.0/new-features>

All fixes from BigBlueButton 2.7.x are here up to and including v2.7.14 (.2 onwards have been manually ported as we no longer merge the 2.7 branch directly into the 3.0 branch).

Big THANK YOU to all comminuty members who helped for this release - both through sending pull requests and through reporting bugs or requesting enhancements! 🎊

Pre-release

Pre-release

In this iteration we have continued to improve the client side performance. Multiple fixes are also included. Optional file scanning for presentation files was added. Behind-the-scenes work was done to support several new features including LiveKit support. However, these are not yet ready for a test yet and will likely remain disabled by default for some time.

Below is a list of the pull requests in this iteration, grouped by component.

Note that BigBlueButton 3.0-dev runs on Ubuntu Jammy (22.04).

BigBlueButton 3.0-dev is under active development. While we don’t recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on our [bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).

Link to installation command / instructions/ schedule / planned features : <https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/3.0/new-features>

All fixes from BigBlueButton 2.7.x are here up to and including v2.7.13 (.2 onwards have been manually ported as we no longer merge the 2.7 branch directly into the 3.0 branch).

Big THANK YOU to all comminuty members who helped for this release - both through sending pull requests and through reporting bugs or requesting enhancements! 🎊

Pre-release

Pre-release

In this iteration we have continued to improve the new GraphQL related core components to improve performance. Multiple fixes are also included. Client side performance have been greatly improved including when the whiteboard is used.

Below is a list of the pull requests in this iteration, grouped by component.

Note that BigBlueButton 3.0-dev runs on Ubuntu Jammy (22.04).

BigBlueButton 3.0-dev is under active development. While we don’t recommend setting it up in a production environment, we do encourage administrators to try out the build with others and give us feedback on our [bigbluebutton-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bigbluebutton-dev).

Link to installation command / instructions/ schedule / planned features : <https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/3.0/new-features>

If you are trying to upgrade a server from v3.0.0-alpha.7 to beta.*, that is possible but check <https://docs.bigbluebutton.org/3.0/administration/install/#note-about-etcdefaultbbb-graphql-server-configurations>

For best results we recommend wiping the 3.0.0-alpha.X server you had and reinstalling 3.0.0-* (latest) via bbb-install.sh.

All fixes from BigBlueButton 2.7.x are here up to and including v2.7.13 (.2 onwards have been manually ported as we no longer merge the 2.7 branch directly into the 3.0 branch).

Big THANK YOU to all comminuty members who helped for this release - both through sending pull requests and through reporting bugs or requesting enhancements! 🎊

### Release name

Passing `-v focal-270` to <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install/v2.7.x-release/bbb-install.sh> will always install the latest released BigBlueButton 2.7 version.

If for some reason you would like to install this specific release, pass `-v focal-270-2.7.13`.

We still recommend using `-v focal-270` as this repository is continually updated with each BigBlueButton 2.7 release.

### Client build: 350
