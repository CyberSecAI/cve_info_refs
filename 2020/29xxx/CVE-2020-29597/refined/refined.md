Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-29597:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper file validation within the `script.php` endpoint of IncomCMS 2.0. The system accepts and uploads any file type without authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure File Upload:** The core issue is the ability to upload arbitrary files to the server without proper validation.
*   **Missing Authentication:** The endpoint allows file uploads without requiring any form of authentication.
*  **Lack of input validation:** No checks are done on the uploaded file, neither for type, nor content

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts, executable files) to the server.
*   This could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain control of the server.
*   The attacker can deface the website or use it for further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is via HTTP POST request to `/incom/modules/uploader/showcase/script.php`.
*   The `Filedata` parameter is used to submit the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need any authentication to upload the file, so a remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to craft an HTTP POST request with the `Filedata` parameter and a malicious file.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mohammed Fadhl Al-Barbari aka @m4dm0e.
*   The `script.php` endpoint located at `/incom/modules/uploader/showcase/script.php` is the vulnerable component.
*  The vulnerable parameter is `Filedata`.
*   The vulnerability is confirmed on IncomCMS 2.0 but older versions are likely also affected.
*   The exploit can be performed through a simple HTML form, no special tools are needed.
