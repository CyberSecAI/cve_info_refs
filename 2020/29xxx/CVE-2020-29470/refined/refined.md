Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29470:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "subject" field of the email functionality in OpenCart. Specifically, the application does not sufficiently encode or filter the input before storing and displaying it, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code can be injected and stored in the database through the email subject field. This code will then be executed when the email is viewed by a user through the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Stealing:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that steal user cookies. This allows the attacker to impersonate an authenticated user and potentially gain access to their session or account.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker can perform arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim user within the context of the application. This includes, but not limited to, modifying data, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing other harmful actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Subject Field:** The vulnerable parameter is the `subject` field when sending email through the OpenCart admin panel's marketing-mail option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs to be logged into the OpenCart admin panel to be able to access the marketing-mail feature and inject the malicious script.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know to target the `subject` field to inject the XSS payload.

**Technical Details**
The exploit example shows the following:
1. The attacker navigates to the opencart admin page and goes to the marketing-mail option.
2. The attacker injects the payload: `<script>alert(123)</script>` into the subject field.
3.  The mail is sent and any user who opens the mail will trigger the XSS.
4. The exploit demonstrates the vulnerable parameter in the POST request:
`subject=hemantsolo%22%2F%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(123)%3C%2Fscript%3E`
