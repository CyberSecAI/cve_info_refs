Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29471:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when uploading a profile image. Specifically, the application does not prevent the upload of an image file that contains embedded malicious code (in this case, Javascript).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. The malicious payload is saved within the application's database (or file system), and then executed when the profile image is displayed to other users or the admin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary Javascript code in the browsers of other users who view the profile image.
*   **Account Takeover:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other actions with the privileges of the victim user.
*   **Data theft:** An attacker may attempt to access data within the application that the user's account has access to.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Image Upload:** The attacker uploads a crafted image file containing malicious Javascript within its metadata or embedded within the image data itself. The "Profile Image" field is the vulnerable point of entry.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have an authenticated user account with the ability to modify their profile, specifically upload a profile image.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the 'Profile Image' parameter to upload the payload.
*  **Crafted Payload:** The attacker must craft a malicious payload in a valid image format that will execute Javascript in the browser context when it is displayed to a user.
