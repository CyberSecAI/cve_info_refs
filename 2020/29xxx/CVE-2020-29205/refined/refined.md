Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-29205

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "name" parameter on the signup page of the "Online Examination System" application. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that gets stored in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS because the input provided in the "name" field during registration is not sanitized before being stored in the database. This allows the injected JavaScript to be executed whenever a user views the affected content, allowing for persistent attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Theft:** The attacker can steal user cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Web Application Defacement:** The attacker can deface the web application by injecting arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.
- **Phishing:** The attacker can redirect users to phishing pages to steal credentials or sensitive information.
- **Malicious Redirection:** The attacker can redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The "name" parameter on the signup page (`sign.php`).
- **Method:** HTTP POST request.
- **Payload:** A malicious JavaScript payload is injected into the "name" parameter, for example: `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`.
- **Storage:** The payload is stored in the application's database.
- **Trigger:** The payload executes whenever a user loads a page displaying the attacker controlled data from the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the signup page.
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable `sign.php` page.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to perform the attack.
- The attacker does not need to be logged in.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit-db entry also contains the steps to reproduce this vulnerability, which are: visiting the signup page, entering the malicious javascript payload in the "name" field and submitting the form. When user logs in with their credentials, the payload is triggered.
- The exploit details provided are consistent and complete enough to understand the vulnerability and reproduce it.
