```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The WordPress DirectoriesPro plugin did not properly sanitize the _drts_form_build_id parameter in a POST request.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML, potentially leading to unauthorized actions in the user's security context.

Attack vectors:
A POST request to /wp-admin/admin.php?page=drts/directories&q=%2F, including a malicious payload in the `_drts_form_build_id` parameter and an invalid CSRF token (`_t_` parameter).

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a malicious POST request while the victim is logged into WordPress as an administrator.
