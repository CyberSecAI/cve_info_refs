Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-29552

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The URVE software fails to properly authenticate requests, allowing for the execution of system commands via a manipulated GET request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306):** The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication checks when processing a specific GET request, which results in the ability to execute arbitrary system commands.
- **Command Injection:** The application is vulnerable to command injection, as it doesn't sanitize or escape user-controlled input passed within GET parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting the URVE software.
- **Potential for Full System Compromise:** This can lead to complete compromise of the server, including data exfiltration, malware installation, or further attacks on the internal network.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can read sensitive data from the server by redirecting command output to publicly accessible locations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP GET request.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely if the affected system is accessible through the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable URVE software server.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URI (`_internal/pc/vpro.php`).
- **Basic Understanding of Command Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious command (e.g., PowerShell command in the provided PoC) and inject it through the vulnerable parameters.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerable endpoint is `_internal/pc/vpro.php`.
- The vulnerable parameters within the GET request are `mac`, `ip`, `operation`, `usr`, `pass`.
- The PoC uses a semicolon (`;`) to inject a PowerShell command within these parameters.
- The output of the injected command is redirected to a file located at `/urve/uploads/out`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor was notified on 2020-11-10 and released a patch on 2020-11-18.
- The advisory recommends that the passed GET parameters should be properly escaped to prevent command injection.
