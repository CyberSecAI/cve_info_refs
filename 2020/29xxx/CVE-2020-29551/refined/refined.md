Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-29551

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a **missing authorization check** in the URVE software, allowing unauthorized access to various files and scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authorization (CWE-862):** The software fails to verify if the user/request is authorized to access specific resources. This allows unauthenticated access to sensitive files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **System Compromise:** Attackers can execute PHP scripts, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and system compromise.
*   **System Shutdown:** Exploiting the `shutdown.php` script can shut down the system.
*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** Unauthenticated access to files like configuration files (`getConfiguration.php`) and backup scripts (`backup_server.php`, `restore_server.php`) can expose sensitive information.
*  **Other System Manipulation**: Other scripts like `abort.php`, `restart.php`, `vpro.php`, `wake.php`, and `runcmd.php` can be accessed to manipulate the system in other ways.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct HTTP Request:** Attackers can directly access vulnerable files by sending HTTP requests to the server, without needing to authenticate.
*   **Path Traversal:** Attackers can traverse the file system to access files by manipulating the URL path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable URVE software. No other special capabilities are required.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization check, allowing unauthenticated users to access sensitive files, including scripts that can be executed to shut down or otherwise manipulate the system. The ease of exploitation and potential severity make this a high-risk vulnerability.
