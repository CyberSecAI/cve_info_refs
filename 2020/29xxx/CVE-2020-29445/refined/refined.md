- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the Team Calendars REST API due to insufficient validation of the `location` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Blind SSRF
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can identify internal hosts and ports by sending crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoint. This allows an attacker to probe the internal network of the Confluence server.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `location` parameter in the Team Calendars REST API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Confluence server, likely over the network.
