Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29056:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw within the CLI of the CDATA OLT devices. Specifically, the `system configurations download olt` command, which is used for TFTP downloads, is vulnerable to command injection via user-controlled input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `system configurations download olt` command. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the device's operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute any shell command with root privileges. This means complete control of the OLT device.
*   **Information Exfiltration:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to exfiltrate sensitive information by redirecting the output of commands, like `/proc/cpuinfo` or the output of `export` to a TFTP server controlled by the attacker.
*   **System Compromise:** Given the root access, attackers can further modify the device's configuration, overwrite the firmware, or potentially use the compromised device for lateral movement within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CLI Access:** The primary attack vector is through the CLI, which could be accessed via telnet. The attacker must already have a working CLI access to exploit this vulnerability, which can be obtained by using the backdoored accounts (see also CVE-2020-29059, CVE-2020-29060, CVE-2020-29061, CVE-2020-29062).
*   **TFTP server**: An attacker needs to setup a TFTP server that is reachable by the vulnerable OLT device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the OLT, and telnet access, which is exposed to the WAN and the FTTH LAN interfaces.
*   **CLI access:** Attacker needs a working CLI access, which can be achieved using the hardcoded backdoored credentials.
*   **TFTP server**: The attacker needs a reachable TFTP server to capture command outputs.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text gives more details than the standard CVE description by describing the vulnerable command and the context where it exists.
*   The text also shows how to exploit the vulnerability, including concrete examples of using `tftp` and redirecting output.
*   The document highlights that the entire appliance runs as `root`, which increases the impact of the vulnerability.
