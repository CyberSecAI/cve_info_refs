The provided content describes a vulnerability related to CVE-2020-29657.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `main_print_unhandled_exception` function within `main-utils.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `do...while` loop at line 180 of `main-utils.c` reads characters from `source_p` using the index `pos`.
- If a syntax error occurs at the end of the input file and the error line number is greater than the actual number of lines in the source file, the loop may attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer.
- The loop continues as long as the character is not a newline (`\n`) and `char_count` is less than `SYNTAX_ERROR_MAX_LINE_LENGTH`. This can lead to reading up to 0x100 bytes past the buffer, because `SYNTAX_ERROR_MAX_LINE_LENGTH` is set to 256, while the read operation is only limited by `SYNTAX_ERROR_MAX_LINE_LENGTH` and not the buffer size.
- The error reporting logic attempts to locate the line of the error which may be beyond source code itself, leading to a buffer overread.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** This results in a crash, specifically a heap-buffer-overflow detected by Address Sanitizer, if enabled. Otherwise it will produce incorrect output with garbage characters.
- **Denial of Service:** The crash can lead to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafting a JavaScript file with a syntax error at the end of the file and specifying an error line number larger than the source code size.
- Inputting this crafted file into the JerryScript engine which will trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a JavaScript file as input to the JerryScript engine.
