Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The official `spiped` docker images before version `1.5-alpine` contained a blank password for the root user within the `/etc/shadow` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Empty Password:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a blank password for the root user. This effectively removes any authentication requirements for root access.
*   **Configuration File Vulnerability:** The issue stems from a misconfiguration in the docker image's `/etc/shadow` file, where a password should be properly set for the root user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privileges:** A remote attacker can gain root access to systems using the affected `spiped` docker images by logging in as the root user with no password.
*   **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation results in full control over the system where the vulnerable docker container is running, potentially leading to data breaches, malware deployment, or denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability allows for remote exploitation due to the container's exposed nature. An attacker does not need local access to exploit it.
*   **Vulnerable Docker Image:** The attack vector is the vulnerable `spiped` docker image itself. If this image is used in a deployed environment, it becomes a point of attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the system running the vulnerable docker container.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** Requires basic knowledge of how docker containers work and the root user account.
*   **No Credentials Needed:** No valid username or password is needed to gain root access, as the root user has a blank password.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected versions of the docker image are `1.5-alpine` and `1.5.0-alpine`
*   The vulnerability was discovered by "koharin(Team of Mobydick)"
*   The provided content includes a link to the official docker hub page for `spiped` which can be used as reference.

The information provided is consistent with a typical vulnerability where a misconfiguration of a docker image leads to a serious security flaw.
