{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2020-29074",
  "description": "x11vnc 0.9.16 uses IPC_CREAT|0777 in shmget calls, which allows access by actors other than the current user.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insecure permissions on shared memory segments created by x11vnc.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure permissions on shared memory segments.",
      "Usage of IPC_CREAT|0777 in shmget calls."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can exploit this flaw to achieve information disclosure, denial of service, or interfere with the VNC session of another user on the same host.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to shared memory segments."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user on the same host where the vulnerable x11vnc server is running."
  },
  "affected_software": {
    "name": "x11vnc",
    "versions": [
      "0.9.16 and prior"
     ]
   },
  "patch_details": "The fix involves modifying the shmget call to use IPC_CREAT|0600 instead of IPC_CREAT|0777, thereby restricting access to the shared memory segments to the user who executed the x11vnc server."
