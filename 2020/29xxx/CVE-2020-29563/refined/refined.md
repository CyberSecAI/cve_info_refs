Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-29563:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way the Western Digital MyCloud PR4100 parses URLs, specifically within the `mod_rewrite` module. This improper URL parsing leads to incorrect authorization decisions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core weakness is an authentication bypass vulnerability that allows remote attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms on the affected devices.
- **Incorrect Authorization:** The software does not properly authorize requests due to the improper URL parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Access:** Exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain complete access to the affected system.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation can result in a complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as indicated by the CVSS score (C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **No User Interaction:**  No user interaction is required for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** An attacker only requires network access to the device; no prior authentication is needed.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was reported by DEVCORE working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative.
* Western Digital has released a firmware update (version 5.07.118) to address this issue. The update enforces stricter whitelisting rules to mitigate the vulnerability.
* The ZDI advisory notes that the specific flaw exists within the `mod_rewrite` module.
* The vulnerability is also present in other MyCloud devices such as PR2100, EX2 Ultra, EX4100 and Mirror Gen 2, which are also patched in the same firmware release.
