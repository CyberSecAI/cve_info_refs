      "description": "The TOTVS Fluig platform allows path traversal via parameter encoded in base64. When exploited, this vulnerability allows the reading of sensitive XML files, which contain data to access the database and, in some cases, LDAP connections and ERP system integrations. In addition, it is also possible to explore system files, such as /etc/passwd and /root/.bash_history",
