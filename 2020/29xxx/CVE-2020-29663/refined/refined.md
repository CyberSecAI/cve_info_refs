Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-29663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from Icinga 2 not properly using Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) when a certificate renewal is requested. When a CRL is configured, Icinga 2 only checks it when connections are first established, not during certificate renewal requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CRL Bypass:**  The primary weakness is that Icinga 2 bypasses the configured CRL during certificate renewal, failing to check if a certificate has been revoked.
- **Automatic Certificate Renewal:** Icinga 2 automatically renews certificates if they were issued before 2017 or expire in less than 30 days, which exacerbates the problem as a revoked certificate could be automatically renewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Renewal of Revoked Certificates:** An attacker could potentially cause a revoked certificate to be automatically renewed if the certificate met the auto-renewal criteria. This means that an endpoint that should no longer be trusted could regain a valid certificate and access resources it should not.
- **Compromise of Security:** If a revoked certificate is renewed, this could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and further exploitation of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker would need network access to the Icinga 2 system and control over a certificate that was previously revoked.
- **Certificate Manipulation (Indirect):** The attacker would not need to directly manipulate the certificate renewal process but rather exploit the flaw in Icinga 2 that ignores the CRL check during the auto-renewal process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control over a previously issued certificate:** An attacker needs to possess a certificate that had previously been valid and then revoked.
- **Network connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Icinga 2 instance to trigger the auto-renewal process.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity because it only impacts setups with external certificate signing and revoked certificates expiring in less than 30 days due to the 15 year validity period of Icinga 2 certificates.
- The issue was resolved in versions v2.11.8 and v2.12.3 of Icinga 2.
- The vulnerability is present in versions v2.8.0 through v2.11.7 and v2.12.2
