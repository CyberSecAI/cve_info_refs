CVE-2020-29661:
- Root cause of vulnerability: A locking issue in the tty subsystem related to the `tiocspgrp` function.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use-after-free vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: A local attacker could potentially corrupt memory or escalate privileges. The highest threat is to confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.
- Attack vectors: Exploitation requires a local account.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have a local account on the system.

The vulnerability exists because `tiocspgrp` does not take the `real_tty->ctrl_lock` before modifying `real_tty->pgrp`, which may be accessed concurrently by other threads/processes. The fix changes the locking to ensure that `real_tty->ctrl_lock` is taken before modifying `real_tty->pgrp`.

Additionally, the provided content includes a patch that fixes the issue in the Linux kernel, specifically in the `drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c` file. The patch modifies the `tiocspgrp()` function to use `real_tty->ctrl_lock` instead of `tty->ctrl_lock`, ensuring that the correct lock is held when modifying the process group.
