| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1906522#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-12-10 17:36:19 UTC  ``` A locking inconsistency issue was discovered in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel through 5.9.13. drivers/tty/tty_io.c and drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c may allow a read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID.  Reference and upstream patch: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c8bcd9c5be24fb9e6132e97da5a35e55a83e36b9>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1906522#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-12-10 17:37:15 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1906523](show_bug.cgi?id=1906523 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-29660 kernel: locking inconsistency in drivers/tty/tty_io.c and drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c can lead to a read-after-free [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1906522#c5)  Alex    2020-12-16 11:59:51 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw is rated as having Low impact (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7)  because of the need to have CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG privileges.  This flaw is rated as having Moderate (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8) impact because of the need to have CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG privileges. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 enabled unprivileged user/network namespaces by default which can be used to exercise this vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1906522#c6)  Alex    2020-12-16 14:43:22 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1906522#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-11-09 17:21:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2021:4140 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4140](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A4140)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1906522#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-11-09 18:23:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2021:4356 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4356](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A4356)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1906522#c23)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-11-09 19:53:22 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-29660>   ``` |  |

tty: Fix ->pgrp locking in tiocspgrp()tiocspgrp() takes two tty\_struct pointers: One to the tty that userspace
passed to ioctl() (`tty`) and one to the TTY being changed (`real\_tty`).
These pointers are different when ioctl() is called with a master fd.
To properly lock real\_tty->pgrp, we must take real\_tty->ctrl\_lock.
This bug makes it possible for racing ioctl(TIOCSPGRP, ...) calls on
both sides of a PTY pair to corrupt the refcount of `struct pid`,
leading to use-after-free errors.
Fixes: 47f86834bbd4 ("redo locking of tty->pgrp")

Debian Bug     : 970736 972345 977048 977615

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-27815

    A flaw was reported in the JFS filesystem code allowing a local
    attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to cause a
    denial of service.

CVE-2020-27825

    Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki reported a use-after-free flaw in the ftrace
    ring buffer resizing logic due to a race condition, which could
    result in denial of service or information leak.

CVE-2020-27830

    Shisong Qin reported a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the Speakup
    screen reader core driver.

CVE-2020-28374

    David Disseldorp discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation
    performed insufficient checking in certain XCOPY requests. An
    attacker with access to a LUN and knowledge of Unit Serial Number
    assignments can take advantage of this flaw to read and write to any
    LIO backstore, regardless of the SCSI transport settings.

CVE-2020-29568 (XSA-349)

    Michael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported that frontends can
    trigger OOM in backends by updating a watched path.

CVE-2020-29569 (XSA-350)

    Olivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported a use-after-free
    flaw which can be triggered by a block frontend in Linux blkback. A
    misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously
    connecting / disconnecting a block frontend.

CVE-2020-29660

    Jann Horn reported a locking inconsistency issue in the tty
    subsystem which may allow a local attacker to mount a
    read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID.

CVE-2020-29661

    Jann Horn reported a locking issue in the tty subsystem which can
    result in a use-after-free. A local attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw for memory corruption or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-36158

    A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the mwifiex WiFi driver
    which could result in denial of service or the execution of
    arbitrary code via a long SSID value.

CVE-2021-3347

    It was discovered that PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free
    during fault handling. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to
    crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-20177

    A flaw was discovered in the Linux implementation of string matching
    within a packet. A privileged user (with root or CAP_NET_ADMIN) can
    take advantage of this flaw to cause a kernel panic when inserting
    iptables rules.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.171-2~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.

For the detailed security status of linux-4.19 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux-4.19>

Subject: 2 kernel issues

Hi,

Jann Horn found 2 locking issues in the Linux Kernel tty subsystem, which can be used for
the usual memory corruption things.

Mitre assigned 2 CVEs:

CVE-2020-29660:

A locking inconsistency issue was discovered in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel through 5.9.13.
drivers/tty/tty_io.c and drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c may
allow a read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID,
aka CID-c8bcd9c5be24.

CVE-2020-29661:

A locking issue was discovered in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel through 5.9.13.
drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c allows a use-after-free attack against TIOCSPGRP, aka CID-54ffccbf053b.

tty: Fix ->session lockingCurrently, locking of ->session is very inconsistent; most places
protect it using the legacy tty mutex, but disassociate\_ctty(),
\_\_do\_SAK(), tiocspgrp() and tiocgsid() don't.
Two of the writers hold the ctrl\_lock (because they already need it for
->pgrp), but \_\_proc\_set\_tty() doesn't do that yet.
On a PREEMPT=y system, an unprivileged user can theoretically abuse
this broken locking to read 4 bytes of freed memory via TIOCGSID if
tiocgsid() is preempted long enough at the right point. (Other things
might also go wrong, especially if root-only ioctls are involved; I'm
not sure about that.)
Change the locking on ->session such that:
- tty\_lock() is held by all writers: By making disassociate\_ctty()
hold it. This should be fine because the same lock can already be
taken through the call to tty\_vhangup\_session().
The tricky part is that we need to shorten the area covered by
siglock to be able to take tty\_lock() without ugly retry logic; as
far as I can tell, this should be fine, since nothing in the
signal\_struct is touched in the `if (tty)` branch.
- ctrl\_lock is held by all writers: By changing \_\_proc\_set\_tty() to
hold the lock a little longer.
- All readers that aren't holding tty\_lock() hold ctrl\_lock: By
adding locking to tiocgsid() and \_\_do\_SAK(), and expanding the area
covered by ctrl\_lock in tiocspgrp().

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-19318, CVE-2019-19813, CVE-2019-19816

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported bugs in Btrfs that could lead to a
    use-after-free or heap buffer overflow, and could be triggered by
    crafted filesystem images.  A user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystems could use these to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-27815

    A flaw was reported in the JFS filesystem code allowing a local
    attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to cause a
    denial of service.

CVE-2020-27825

    Adam 'pi3' Zabrocki reported a use-after-free flaw in the ftrace
    ring buffer resizing logic due to a race condition, which could
    result in denial of service or information leak.

CVE-2020-28374

    David Disseldorp discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation
    performed insufficient checking in certain XCOPY requests. An
    attacker with access to a LUN and knowledge of Unit Serial Number
    assignments can take advantage of this flaw to read and write to any
    LIO backstore, regardless of the SCSI transport settings.

CVE-2020-29568 (XSA-349)

    Michael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported that frontends can
    trigger OOM in backends by updating a watched path.

CVE-2020-29569 (XSA-350)

    Olivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported a use-after-free
    flaw which can be triggered by a block frontend in Linux blkback. A
    misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously
    connecting / disconnecting a block frontend.

CVE-2020-29660

    Jann Horn reported a locking inconsistency issue in the tty
    subsystem which may allow a local attacker to mount a
    read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID.

CVE-2020-29661

    Jann Horn reported a locking issue in the tty subsystem which can
    result in a use-after-free. A local attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw for memory corruption or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-36158

    A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the mwifiex WiFi driver
    which could result in denial of service or the execution of
    arbitrary code via a long SSID value.

CVE-2021-3178

    吴异 reported an information leak in the NFSv3 server.  When only
    a subdirectory of a filesystem volume is exported, an NFS client
    listing the exported directory would obtain a file handle to the
    parent directory, allowing it to access files that were not meant
    to be exported.

    Even after this update, it is still possible for NFSv3 clients to
    guess valid file handles and access files outside an exported
    subdirectory, unless the "subtree_check" export option is enabled.
    It is recommended that you do not use that option but only export
    whole filesystem volumes.

CVE-2021-3347

    It was discovered that PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free
    during fault handling. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to
    crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-26930 (XSA-365)

    Olivier Benjamin, Norbert Manthey, Martin Mazein, and Jan
    H. Schönherr discovered that the Xen block backend driver
    (xen-blkback) did not handle grant mapping errors correctly.  A
    malicious guest could exploit this bug to cause a denial of
    service (crash), or possibly an information leak or privilege
    escalation, within the domain running the backend, which is
    typically dom0.

CVE-2021-26931 (XSA-362), CVE-2021-26932 (XSA-361), CVE-2021-28038 (XSA-367)

    Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen support code and various Xen
    backend drivers did not handle grant mapping errors correctly.  A
    malicious guest could exploit these bugs to cause a denial of
    service (crash) within the domain running the backend, which is
    typically dom0.

CVE-2021-27363

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    properly restrict access to transport handle attributes in sysfs.
    On a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, this is an information
    leak to local users and makes it easier to exploit CVE-2021-27364.

CVE-2021-27364

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    properly restrict access to its netlink management interface.  On
    a system acting as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use
    these to cause a denial of service (disconnection of storage) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-27365

    Adam Nichols reported that the iSCSI initiator subsystem did not
    correctly limit the lengths of parameters or "passthrough PDUs"
    sent through its netlink management interface.  On a system acting
    as an iSCSI initiator, a local user could use these to leak the
    contents of kernel memory, to cause a denial of service (kernel
    memory corruption or crash), and probably for privilege
    escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.258-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

    ring buffer resizing logic due to a race condition, which could
    result in denial of service or information leak.

CVE-2020-27830

    Shisong Qin reported a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the Speakup
    screen reader core driver.

CVE-2020-28374

    David Disseldorp discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation
    performed insufficient checking in certain XCOPY requests. An

CVE-2021-3347

    It was discovered that PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free
    during fault handling. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to
    crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-20177

    A flaw was discovered in the Linux implementation of string matching
    within a packet. A privileged user (with root or CAP_NET_ADMIN) can
    take advantage of this flaw to cause a kernel panic when inserting
    iptables rules.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.19.171-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
