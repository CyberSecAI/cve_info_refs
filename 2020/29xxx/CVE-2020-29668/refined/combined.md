## Version

v6.2.56-1.el7 on Centos 7.8.2003

## Installation method

Centos package

## Expected behavior

permission denied

## Actual behavior

error message and action actually executed anyways.

## Additional information

In our setup we have a problem with incorrect cookies via the SOAP API of sympa.

If the SOAP request contains a correct cookie everything works as expected -> request executed

If the SOAP request contains a correct but outdated cookie, everything works as expected -> request correctly denied.

If the SOAP request contains an arbitrary string as cookie (e.g. "asdkjasdljkahsdlkjh"), SOAP replies with an error ("Undefined session ID in cookie") but STILL executes every requests we make. By this we can add email adresses to lists without authentication, any operation we tried was still successful.

We could hotfix the problem by inserting a die(); command into /usr/share/sympa/lib/Sympa/WWW/Session.pm:129 like this:

```
    my $session_id = _cookie2id($cookie);
    unless ($session_id) {
        $log->syslog('info', 'Undefined session ID in cookie "%s"', $cookie);
        die('nothing');
        return undef;
    }

```

It is possible to retrieve the email addresses of a list through the SOAP API without proper authentication.

This requires the following knowledge:

- name of the list
- email of an user that is allowed to see the email addresses OR a valid session id

The SOAP API is not activated with the default Debconf settings.

Patch attached.

Package        : sympa
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-9369 CVE-2020-10936 CVE-2020-26932 CVE-2020-29668
Debian Bug     : 952428 961491 971904 976020

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Sympa, a mailing list
manager, which could result in local privilege escalation, denial of
service or unauthorized access via the SOAP API.

Additionally to mitigate CVE-2020-26880 the sympa_newaliases-wrapper is
no longer installed setuid root by default. A new Debconf question is
introduced to allow setuid installations in setups where it is needed.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.2.40~dfsg-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your sympa packages.

tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sympa>

CVE ID         : CVE-2020-29668
Debian Bug     : 976020

Sympa, a modern mailing list manager, grants full SOAP API access by
sending invalid string as the cookie value, if the SOAP endpoint was
enabled. An attacker could manipulate the mailing lists, including
subscribing e-mails or getting the list of subscribers.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
6.2.16~dfsg-3+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your sympa packages.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Fix the defects in the current check:

* Allows bogus session id
* Allows session id which belongs to different user

May fix [#1041](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/1041).

Sorry, something went wrong.

## [6.2.59b.2](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/tree/6.2.59b.2)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/compare/6.2.59b.1...6.2.59b.2)

**Changes:**

* Personalization (formerly sometimes called "merge feature") is now restricted by default: It is enabled only when the message is posted via web interface, and is applied only on footer and header (if any). This behavior may be changed using `personalization` list parameter, however, listmasters are recommended to review whether wide range of conversion as previous versions is required. See also [#1037](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/1037).
* Now the setuid wrappers may be disabled, if installation process allows. Packagers are encouraged to provide configuration not using setuid wrappers as possible. See also [#943](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/943) and related issues/PRs.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/compare/6.2.33b.2...6.2.34)

**Changes:**

* `cpanfile` to manage depencency modules was introduced [#355](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/355). `ModDef.pm` was deprecated.
* Directory organization under `static_content` directory was changed [#220](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/220).
* WWSympa: UI framework was switched to Foundation Sites 6 [#170](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/170). Appearances of web interface were slightly changed, and several web templates were changed much.
* WWSympa: `wwsympa_url` parameter became optional [#330](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/330). Conversely, if this parameter was not specified in `robot.conf`, web interface will be disabled for that domain. Existing configuration will be automatically fixed during upgrading process.
* `sympa.conf.bin` and `robot.conf.bin` will no longer be created/updated [#284](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/284). They were not used anyway. `config.bin` for list config will still be available.
* List parameter `host` was deprecated [#43](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/43). If you were using it, you should check alias files: See "[Upgrading notes](https://sympa-community.github.io/manual/upgrade/notes.html)" for details.
* Owners and moderators are no longer stored in list config file: They are stored only in database [#49](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/49).
  + New pages to configure them were added to web interface [#275](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/275).
  + New functions `--dump_users` and `--restore_users` to dump and restore users in database were added to `sympa.pl` command line utility [#232](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/232) [#267](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/267).
  + List creation templates will not need modification. However, if you were creating lists not using those templates, i.e. creating list directories and necessary files manually, you may also have to create dump files (See "[Dump files](https://sympa-community.github.io/manual/customize/basics-list-config.html#dump-files)" for details).

**Implemented enhancements:**

* Introducing cpanfile [#355](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/355)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/compare/3a644d4...6.2.17b.1)

**Implemented enhancements:**

* Improved on-line help on list configuration edit form [#15](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/15) ([ikedas](https://github.com/ikedas))
* [6.2] Rewriting code on list configuration form [#13](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/13) ([ikedas](https://github.com/ikedas))
* Features in subversion repository (see Full Changelog for details):
  + [12965] Separate executable upgrade\_shared\_repository.pl. Ordinarily, it will be invoked automatically during upgrading process.
  + [12953] WWSympa: Function to view messages (held messages, bounces and notifications) works, even if javascript is disabled. As a result, almost all functions of web interface are available again in the environment without javascript.
  + [12862] Adding the template to visualize the lists of lists including the current list.

**Changes:**

* Changes in subversion repository (see Full Changelog for details):
  + [12937] MICRO-CAL by Amroune Selim has retired. Instead, jQuery UI Datepicker Widget is introduced.
  + [12934] WWSympa: Action URLs no longer may contain e-mail addresses in their path components. For example:
    `http://host.name/sympa/editsubscriber/list/email%40addr.ess`
    ...is no longer available;
    `http://host.name/sympa/editsubscriber/list?email=email%40addr.ess`
    ...may be used ("%40" is the encoded form of "@").
    Because, e-mail addresses can contain slashes ("/") while web servers cannot handle slashes in URL path appropriately: Query parameter would be better to be used.
  + [12893] WWSympa: When a name of newly uploaded file in shared document repository is duplicate of exisiting file, uploading will no longer be confirmed. Instead, a suffix (2), (3), ... will be added to name of the new file.

* riseup fixes to templates [#4](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/4) ([taggart](https://github.com/taggart))
* Late changes on svn repo [#2](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/2)
  + [bug] wwsympa: Virtual robots in serveradmin/vhosts and rename\_list\_request pages were not shown correctly.
  + [bug] If originator address in message contains upper-case letters, "tag this mail for deletion" in archive won't be shown. Fixed by correcting mhonarc-ressouorces.tt2. Rebuilding is needed to correct past archives.
* [bug][#11020] List admins changes not synchronized with admin\_table [#1](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/pull/1) ([salaun-urennes1](https://github.com/salaun-urennes1))
* Fixed bugs in subversion repository (see Full Changelog for details):
  + [12972] [#11014] [Comitted by M. Deranek] SQLite: While upgrading Sympa by "sympa.pl --upgrade", upgrading proceduce may fail complaining about non-existent indexes. Fixed by skipping non-existing indexes and tables to be removed.
  + [12970] [#11024] [Reported by S. Hornburg, LinuXia Systems] An "obsoleted" list parameter header\_list is saved in list config as garbage. Fixed by removing useless default value.
  + [12969] [#10969] [Reported by M. Perini, Università degli Studi di Perugia] In "Listing messages to moderate" page, "Distribute" action fails with error "ERROR (distribute) - Missing argument id|idspam", if it is done in the dialog shown by clicking "View" button. Fixed by not opening new dialog but transiting confirmation page to choose message topics.
  + [12968] [#10968] [Submitted by S. Hornburg] Visibility settings in topics.conf were ignored. Fixed by cheking topics\_visibility scenario along with subtopics.
  + [12966] [Reported by A. Meaden, Univ of Kent and submitted by F. Lachapelle, Developpement Strategique Sophos Inc.] The database log does not record any messages that were successfully delivered to mailing lists. Fixed by adding an appropriate call to db\_log().
  + [12959] [Reported by A. Gouaux] Exclusion table can not be updated when a user is deleted. Because family\_exclusion column is a primary key in exclusion\_table but may not have implicit default. Fixed by assigning an empty value to such field explicitly.
  + [12956] [Submitted by D. Stoye, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin] A typo in sympa.wsdl broke SOAP interface.
  + [12948] WWSympa: viewbounce & viewmod: If the list name or the email address contains "+", incorrect web links to attachments are generated.
    Fixed by encoding special characters in generated links.
  + [12929] [#10866] [Reported by A. Bernstein, Electric Embers] At least on FreeBSD, init script cannot detect orphaned PID file: Such PIDs are treated as active. Fixed by checking existence of process more strictly.
  + [12927] [#6988] [Reported by D. Pritts, Internet2] Using cookie web\_archive\_spam\_protection, user is not redirected to their originally requested page. Fixed by preserving path info the user initially specified.
  + [12911] nginx with systemd: If SCRIPT\_FILENAME CGI environment variable is set, wwsympa service will terminate when wwsympa.fcgi is updated. Fixed by adding "Restart=always" option to unit file.
  + [12907] [Reported by several listmasters] WWSympa: Link prefetch feature by some browsers may fetch "Unsubscribe" link off the stage so that the users may unsubscribe themselves unconsciously. "Subscribe" and "Delete" (file) links are alike.
    Fixed by adding a step to demand confirmation: Blocked action is stored in session, user is brought to confirmation page and, if user confirms, the action will be processed.
  + [12902] File names generated by some applications on Mac OS X (uploaded files, files in ZIP archive, ...) may not be shown correctly on other platforms: Accentsare shown separately. Fixed by applying Normalization Form C (NFC) to file names.
  + [12867] When reading the shared documents, file names were not converted from the URL form to the local storage form, leading to errors when downloading files containing spaces or special characters.
  + [12858] sympa.pl --purge\_list didn't purge list in the family: It was marked family\_closed. Fixed by really purging such list.
  + [12857] [#5976] [Reported by I. Vindenes, Universitetet i Oslo] Users can subscribe to a pending list even if allow\_subscribe\_if\_pending parameter is set to off.
  + [12855] WWSympa: Color picker in skinsedit page did not support devices with touch panel. Fixed by handling appropriate browser events. Confirmed by recent version of Safari on iOS at least.
  + [12853] WWSympa: Color picker in skinsedit page did not work sane. Fixed by calculating right metrics. Confirmed by recent version of Mozilla Firefox, Google
    Chrome and Internet Explorer.
  + [12848] [#10808] [Reported by X. Bachelot] Suppressing some warnings by C compiler at build time.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
