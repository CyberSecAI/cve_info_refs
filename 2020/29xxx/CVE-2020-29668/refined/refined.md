{
  "CVE-2020-29668": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Sympa SOAP API does not properly validate the session ID in the cookie, allowing the execution of requests with an arbitrary session ID string.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper authentication and authorization in the SOAP API. Lack of proper session ID validation.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain full access to the SOAP API, potentially allowing them to manipulate mailing lists, subscribe emails, and access subscriber information without proper authentication.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through a specially crafted SOAP request with an arbitrary string used as a cookie. Network access to the SOAP endpoint is needed.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send SOAP requests to the vulnerable Sympa instance and know the list name and an email of a user that is allowed to see the email addresses OR a valid session id."
    },
    {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `authenticateAndRun` function in the Sympa SOAP API doesn't properly validate session IDs.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authentication bypass due to lack of proper session ID verification in the `authenticateAndRun` function. The system does not check if the session ID belongs to a specific user. SOAP API is vulnerable to unauthorized access",
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain unauthorized full access to the SOAP API by providing an arbitrary string as a cookie value, allowing them to perform various actions on the mailing lists, including adding email addresses to lists without authentication",
        "Attack vectors": "Sending SOAP requests with an arbitrary string in the cookie value to the `authenticateAndRun` function of the SOAP API.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the Sympa SOAP API endpoint.  No specific privilege on the target system is needed."
