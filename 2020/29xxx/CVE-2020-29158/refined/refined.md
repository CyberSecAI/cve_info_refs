Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in Zammad when handling internal articles within ticket views. Specifically, agents who also have customer roles in other groups were able to view internal articles that should only be visible to full agents of a group.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Agents acting as customers were able to access internal articles within the ticket system, which should have been restricted to full agents.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The system failed to properly enforce the separation of permissions between agent roles and customer roles when viewing ticket details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access to internal information:** An agent acting as a customer could view potentially sensitive or confidential internal communications and information intended for internal use only.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Viewing ticket details: The vulnerability is triggered when an agent with a customer role views the detail of a ticket.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a Zammad user with a dual role: an agent in one group and a customer in another. This is a built-in feature of Zammad which is what caused the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Zammad version 3.5.0.
- It was fixed in versions 3.5.1 and 3.6.0.
- The security advisory is identified as ZAA-2020-23.
- The issue is described as "Information Disclosure to agents being customers".
- The severity is rated as low.
- The provided Github commit history appears to address the vulnerability by enhancing the `access?` method in `app/policies/ticket/article_policy.rb` to ensure proper permission checks for internal articles.
