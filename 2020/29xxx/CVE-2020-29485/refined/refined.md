Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-29485:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a memory leak in `oxenstored`, the OCaml implementation of Xenstore, specifically when handling guest `XS_RESET_WATCHES` requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   When a guest requests `XS_RESET_WATCHES`, not all of the tracking information associated with the watches is properly freed. This leads to an accumulation of memory usage in `oxenstored`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A malicious or compromised guest can repeatedly trigger the `XS_RESET_WATCHES` request. This can lead to unbounded memory consumption by `oxenstored`, ultimately resulting in a system-wide Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a malicious guest sending the `XS_RESET_WATCHES` request to the Xen hypervisor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to control a guest domain running on a Xen hypervisor that is using the OCaml implementation of Xenstore (`oxenstored`).

**Additional Information:**

*   This vulnerability affects all Xen versions since 4.6 that use `oxenstored`. Systems using the C implementation of Xenstore are not vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Edwin Török of Citrix.
*   Patches are available to address the memory leak, and are typically applied to the stable branches of Xen.
