Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29324:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The D-Link Router DIR-895L MFC v1.21b05 firmware contains hardcoded Telnet service credentials. These credentials are not encrypted and can be retrieved from the firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the use of hardcoded, default credentials for the Telnet service.
*   **Cleartext Storage:** The username and password are stored in plaintext within the firmware, making them easily accessible if the firmware is decompiled.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The Telnet service is exposed in a way that allows an attacker to attempt login with the discovered credentials without authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Firmware Access:** A successful exploit grants the attacker unauthorized access to the router's firmware.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:**  Attackers can extract sensitive data from the router's firmware once accessed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Firmware Decompilation:** The attacker must first obtain a copy of the router's firmware. Then decompile the firmware and extract the credentials from the relevant configuration files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Firmware Access:** The attacker must be able to acquire the firmware of the D-Link DIR-895L router.
*   **Technical Expertise:** The attacker requires skills to decompile the firmware and extract the relevant information.
*   **Network Access (Implicit):** While not explicitly stated, access to the router's Telnet service (likely local network) is implied for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content provides a step-by-step "Proof of Concept" (POC) on how to extract the credentials from the firmware. This includes commands such as `cat etc/init0.d/S80telnetd.sh` to find the username and location of the password variable and `cat etc/config/image_sign` to retrieve the password.
*   The vendor, D-Link, released a support announcement addressing the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered in August 2020, and a fix was released by August 2021.
