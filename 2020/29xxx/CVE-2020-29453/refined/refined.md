- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `CachingResourceDownloadRewriteRule` class in Jira Server and Jira Data Center had an incorrect path access check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A pre-authorization arbitrary file read vulnerability, specifically within the `WEB-INF` and `META-INF` directories.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated remote attackers could read arbitrary files within the `WEB-INF` and `META-INF` directories, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated access via the vulnerable `CachingResourceDownloadRewriteRule` class.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific capabilities required beyond network access to the vulnerable Jira instance, as the vulnerability is pre-authorization.
