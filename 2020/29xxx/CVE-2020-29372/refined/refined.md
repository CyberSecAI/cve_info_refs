        "root_cause": "A race condition exists in core dump handling where the mm of another process can be accessed without holding the mmap_sem. This can occur when IORING_OP_MADVISE performs operations on the VM of another process, potentially racing with core dump handling.",

          "Incorrect assumption that mm is always valid",
