Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29260:

**Root Cause:**
- A memory leak exists in the `rfbClientCleanup()` function within the libvncserver library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `rfbClientCleanup()` function does not properly free the allocated memory for `client->vncRec`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by repeatedly triggering the memory leak, eventually exhausting available memory resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by interacting with the VNC server in a way that triggers repeated calls to `rfbClientCleanup()` without freeing the memory associated with `vncRec`, eventually exhausting available memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to interact with a vulnerable VNC server and trigger the code path that leads to the `rfbClientCleanup()` function.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided GitHub commit fixes the vulnerability by adding a `free(client->vncRec)` call in the `rfbClientCleanup()` function.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DLA 3125-1) also highlights this vulnerability and the fix provided in libvncserver version `0.9.11+dfsg-1.3+deb10u5`.
