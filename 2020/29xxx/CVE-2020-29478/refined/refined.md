- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A default configuration setting in CA Service Catalog allows remote attackers to access and update configuration information, if the password for the Setup Utility was not set during installation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure default configuration, specifically a missing password for the Setup Utility.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service condition by modifying configuration information.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access to the Setup Utility interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the system hosting CA Service Catalog and the ability to access the Setup Utility. They also need knowledge of the default configuration allowing password bypass.
