Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the login functionality of the EgavilanMedia Address Book version 1.0. The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs in the login form.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi): The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code through user-supplied input fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Authentication Bypass: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the application's admin panel without needing valid credentials.
- Data Breach: This access could potentially lead to a data breach, as the attacker could access or modify sensitive data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the application's login form, accessible via a web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by submitting the following payload in both the username/user ID and password fields of the login form: `admin' or '1'='1`
- This payload exploits the SQL injection vulnerability, causing the login query to always return a true condition. As a result, it bypasses the authentication process and grants admin access.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided resources also include mitigation strategies such as validating user inputs, sanitizing data, using prepared statements, and regular security practices.
