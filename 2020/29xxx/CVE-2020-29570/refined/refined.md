{
  "cve": "CVE-2020-29570",
  "description": "The recording of the per-vCPU control block mapping maintained by Xen and that of pointers into the control block is reversed. The consumer assumes, seeing the former initialized, that the latter are also ready for use.",
  "affected_versions": "All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable.",
  "root_cause": "The order of operations for initializing the per-vCPU control block mapping and the pointers to the control block is reversed. Specifically, the mapping is initialized before the pointers, which leads consumers to assume the pointers are valid when they are not.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Incorrect initialization order"
  ],
  "impact": "A malicious or buggy guest kernel can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire system.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Malicious guest kernel",
    "Buggy guest kernel"
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have control over the guest kernel.",
  "mitigation": "There is no known mitigation other than applying the provided patch.",
   "patches": [
        "xsa358.patch (xen-unstable)",
        "xsa358-4.14.patch (Xen 4.14 - 4.10)"
