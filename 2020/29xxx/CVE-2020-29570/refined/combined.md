Subject: Xen Security Advisory 358 v5 (CVE-2020-29570) - FIFO event
 channels control block related ordering

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-29570 / XSA-358
                               version 5

          FIFO event channels control block related ordering

UPDATES IN VERSION 5
====================

"Unstable" patch updated (needed re-basing).

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Recording of the per-vCPU control block mapping maintained by Xen and
that of pointers into the control block is reversed.  The consumer
assumes, seeing the former initialized, that the latter are also ready
for use.

IMPACT
======

Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS)
attack affecting the entire system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.3 and
earlier are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no known mitigation.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Julien Grall of Amazon.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

                 CVE-2020-29483 CVE-2020-29484 CVE-2020-29485 CVE-2020-29486
                 CVE-2020-29566 CVE-2020-29570 CVE-2020-29571

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor:

Several security issues affecting Xenstore could result in cross
domain access (denial of service, information leaks or privilege
escalation) or denial of service against xenstored.

Additional vulnerabilities could result in guest-to-host denial of
service.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.11.4+57-g41a822c392-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

For the detailed security status of xen please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xen>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1905672#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-12-08 19:31:57 UTC  ``` Neither xenstore implementation does any permissions checks when reporting a xenstore watch event.  A guest administrator can watch the root xenstored node, which will cause notifications for every created, modified and deleted key.  A guest administrator can also use the special watches, which will cause a notification every time a domain is created and destroyed.  Data may include:  - number, type and domids of other VMs  - existence and domids of driver domains  - numbers of virtual interfaces, block devices, vcpus  - existence of virtual framebuffers and their backend style (eg,    existence of VNC service)  - Xen VM UUIDs for other domains  - timing information about domain creation and device setup  - some hints at the backend provisioning of VMs and their devices  The watch events do not contain values stored in xenstore, only key names.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1905672#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-12-15 20:03:19 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/12/15/2>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1905672#c2)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-12-15 20:03:33 UTC  ``` Created xen tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1908091](show_bug.cgi?id=1908091 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-29480 xen: xenstore watch notifications lacking permission checks (XSA-115) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1905672#c3)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-12-15 22:20:09 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.
