The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Tesla Model X keyless entry system, but it does not match the description of CVE-2020-29438, which is a placeholder. Therefore, I will provide the vulnerability details extracted from the provided article.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in a combination of vulnerabilities in the Tesla Model X's keyless entry system. This includes:
1.  Lack of "code signing" for key fob firmware updates, which allows an attacker to rewrite the firmware.
2.  The Body Control Module (BCM) derives its identity code from the last five digits of the car's VIN, which is publicly visible.
3.  The BCM does not validate the cryptographic certificate when pairing a new key fob to the car.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **Unsigned Firmware Updates:** The key fobs accept firmware updates via Bluetooth without verifying the authenticity of the update through cryptographic signatures.
2.  **Predictable BCM Identity Code:** The BCM uses a code derived from the last five digits of the car's VIN, which is easily obtainable.
3.  **Lack of Key Certificate Validation:** The BCM does not validate the cryptographic certificate of new key fobs being paired with the car.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to:
1.  Unlock a Tesla Model X by extracting the unlock code from the key fob.
2.  Pair a rogue key fob with the car, allowing the attacker to drive away with the stolen vehicle.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector involves:
1.  Reading the car's VIN to obtain the last five digits, usually from the dashboard.
2.  Using a custom-made hardware kit (costing around $300) with a Bluetooth radio, Model X BCM, and a key fob.
3.  Exploiting the lack of code signing to rewrite the key fob firmware via Bluetooth.
4.  Using the spoofed BCM to wake up the target key fob and extract the unlock code.
5.  Physically accessing the vehicle's internal network via a port under the dashboard to pair a new key fob.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

1.  **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within approximately 15 feet of the victim's key fob initially for the wake up command. The rest of the attack can be carried out from hundreds of feet away.
2.  **Technical knowledge:** The attacker needs a moderate level of technical understanding of radio signals, Bluetooth, and the CAN bus system.
3.  **Hardware:** The attacker needs to purchase or create the custom hardware kit containing the necessary components like a Model X BCM, a key fob, a Raspberry Pi mini computer, and a battery.
4. **Physical Access:** The attacker needs brief physical access to the vehicle's interior to plug a computer into a port under the dashboard.
5. **VIN:** The attacker needs to obtain the VIN of the target vehicle.
