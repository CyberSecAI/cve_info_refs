  "info": "The provided content discusses a vulnerability in Fujitsu Eternus Storage DX200 S4 devices, which is the subject of CVE-2020-29127. The vulnerability is an Improper Authentication issue that allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain root access.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from a broken authentication mechanism. After a user logs into the portal as root in a web browser, the portal can be accessed with root privileges from a different web browser using a specific URI, `cgi-bin/csp?cspid={XXXXXXXXXX}&csppage=cgi_PgOverview&csplang=en`. This indicates that the session handling is not properly tied to the originating browser, and a valid session can be re-used from a different browser instance.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Improper authentication\n- Session reuse vulnerability\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Full compromise of the device with root privileges.\n- Unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n- Ability to modify device configurations and data.\n- Complete compromise of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the device.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attack is performed remotely over the network, using a web browser.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Fujitsu Eternus Storage DX200 S4 device.\n- An attacker needs to trick or have a user log into the web portal, then take the URI to reuse the authenticated session.",
  "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is triggered by reusing a valid session in a different browser instance via a specific URI. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-287, and has a CVSS score of 10/10 because it leads to a complete compromise of the device, allowing complete control by a remote attacker."
