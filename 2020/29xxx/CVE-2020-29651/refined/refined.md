Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-29651:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from a regular expression (regex) used in the `py.path.svnwc` component of the `py` library when processing SVN blame output.
   - The regex `r'\s\*(\d+)\s\*(\S+) (.\*)'` used for parsing blame output was susceptible to catastrophic backtracking.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Regex Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The primary weakness is the vulnerable regex pattern `\s\*(\d+)\s\*(\S+)`.
   - The ambiguity introduced by `\s*` (zero or more spaces) combined with `(\d+)` (one or more digits) and `(\S+)` (one or more non-whitespace characters) allows an attacker to craft malicious input that forces the regex engine into exponential backtracking, resulting in excessive CPU consumption.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by providing malicious input to the `blame` functionality of the `py.path.svnwc` component.
   - This leads to excessive processing time and potential service disruption.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector involves supplying a specially crafted string to the `blame` functionality that exploits the ReDoS vulnerability in the regex.
   - The malicious input needs to have a specific pattern to trigger the worst-case backtracking behavior such as a long sequence of "1" * 5000.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - An attacker needs to be able to supply input to the vulnerable code path that invokes the vulnerable regex.
   - The attacker does not need any specific authentication to exploit this.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `py` versions up to `1.9.0`.
*   The fix for the vulnerability involves changing the regex to `r'\s\*(\d+)\s+(\S+) (.\*)'`, replacing the `*` after the whitespace with `+`, forcing at least one space.
*   The fix has been implemented in the `py` library in version `1.10.0`
*   The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2020-29651 and GHSA-hj5v-574p-mj7c.
*   The fix was introduced in this pull request: [https://github.com/pytest-dev/py/pull/257](https://github.com/pytest-dev/py/pull/257)
