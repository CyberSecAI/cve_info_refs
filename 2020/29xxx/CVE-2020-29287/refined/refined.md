Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL Injection vulnerability in the Car Rental Management System:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `car_id` and `id` GET parameters into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The core vulnerability is a classic SQL injection. The application's code directly concatenates the values from `$_GET['car_id']` and `$_GET['id']` into the SQL query strings. Specifically, the vulnerable code snippets are in `booking.php` and `view_car.php`:
    *   `$qry = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM cars where id= ".$_GET['car_id']);`
    *   `$qry = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM cars where id= ".$_GET['id']);`
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the user-supplied `car_id` and `id` parameters, leading to the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries:** The application uses `query()` with string concatenation instead of using parameterized queries or prepared statements, which would prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to access sensitive data within the database, including usernames, passwords, car details, booking information, and other confidential data.
*   **Data Modification:** Beyond reading data, an attacker could modify or delete database records, potentially disrupting the application's normal functionality.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** As shown in the example, the attacker can bypass authentication and potentially gain administrative access.
*   **Complete Compromise:** In severe cases, depending on the database user's privileges, an attacker could potentially gain control over the database server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests. The vulnerable parameters (`car_id` and `id`) are part of the URL.
    *   `GET /car_rental/booking.php?car_id=1+UNION+ALL+SELECT+1,@@VERSION,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10#`
    *   `GET /car_rental/index.php?page=view_car&id=-3+union+all+select+1,concat(username,0x3a,password),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10+from+users#`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application to send HTTP requests.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious SQL queries.
*   **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the system.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided exploit-db content gives specific examples of the vulnerable parameters (`car_id` in `booking.php` and `id` in `view_car.php`) and provides example payloads for exploiting the SQL Injection vulnerability, using `UNION ALL SELECT` to extract database information.
* The github content confirms the identified vulnerable parameters and files.
* The sourcecodester content provides context on the application and its functionality, but does not provide information on the vulnerability itself.
* The content gives more detail than the official CVE description, by giving vulnerable files and parameters, as well as example payloads.

The vulnerability is rated as **critical** due to the potential for complete compromise of the database and sensitive data.
