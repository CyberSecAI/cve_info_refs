Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29573:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the `printf` function in the GNU C Library (glibc) handles non-normal long double values on x86 architectures. Specifically, the `__mpn_extract_long_double` function could produce irregularly shaped multi-precision integers when processing these non-normal numbers. This would lead to undefined behavior in `__printf_fp_l`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Handling of Non-Normal Numbers:** The `printf` function, particularly the `__mpn_extract_long_double` function within it, didn't correctly process non-normal long double values, leading to the generation of invalid multi-precision integers.
- **Inconsistent `isnan` Behavior:**  There's a disagreement between the GCC built-in `isnan` function and the glibc implementation regarding non-normal numbers that are not explicitly NaNs. This inconsistency caused the incorrect codepath to be taken and trigger the vulnerability.
- **Undefined Behavior:**  The invalid multi-precision integers produced could cause undefined behavior in `__printf_fp_l`, potentially leading to a crash or other unexpected results.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service, as the incorrect handling of these numbers could lead to crashes.
- **Undefined Behavior:** The exploitation leads to undefined behavior within the `printf` function, which could have more unpredictable consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Input:** An attacker needs to provide specially crafted non-normal long double values as input to the `printf` function through a format specifier like `%Lg`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Control Input:** The attacker must have some control over the input to the `printf` function so that it processes the crafted non-normal long double value.

**Additional Notes from the provided documents:**
- **Affected Products:** NetApp products incorporating vulnerable versions of glibc are impacted. Specifically NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault) and NetApp SolidFire Baseboard Management Controller (BMC).
- **Fix:**  The vulnerability is fixed in glibc 2.33. The fix involves updating `__mpn_extract_long_double` to properly handle these non-normal numbers by adding the missing sign bit and producing regularly shaped multi-precision integers.
- **Workaround:** There is no known workaround for the NetApp products except to upgrade.
- **Public Discussion:** NetApp mentions that they are aware of public discussion of the vulnerability.
- **Gentoo Linux:** Gentoo Linux was also affected, where the vulnerability was addressed in `sys-libs/glibc-2.32-r5`.
- **Red Hat:** The bug was also tracked in Red Hat Bugzilla and was resolved in glibc 2.33.

In summary, CVE-2020-29573 is a vulnerability caused by improper handling of non-normal long double numbers within the glibc `printf` function, potentially leading to DoS and other undefined behavior. This vulnerability requires the attacker to be able to provide crafted input to `printf`.
