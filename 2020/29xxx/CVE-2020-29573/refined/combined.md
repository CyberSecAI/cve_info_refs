# [PATCH] x86: Harden printf against non-normal long double values (bug 26649)

```
The behavior of isnan/__builtin_isnan on bit patterns that do not
correspond to something that the CPU would produce from valid inputs
is currently under-defined in the toolchain. (The GCC built-in and
glibc disagree.)

The isnan check in PRINTF_FP_FETCH in stdio-common/printf_fp.c
assumes the GCC behavior that returns true for non-normal numbers
which are not specified as NaN. (The glibc implementation returns
false for such numbers.)

At present, passing non-normal numbers to __mpn_extract_long_double
causes this function to produce irregularly shaped multi-precision
integers, triggering undefined behavior in __printf_fp_l.

With GCC 10 and glibc 2.32, this behavior is not visible because
__builtin_isnan is used, which avoids calling
__mpn_extract_long_double in this case.  This commit updates the
implementation of __mpn_extract_long_double so that regularly shaped
multi-precision integers are produced in this case, avoiding
undefined behavior in __printf_fp_l.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=26649#c0)  Florian Weimer    2020-09-22 14:24:34 UTC  ``` The behavior of isnan/__builtin_isnan on bit patterns that do not correspond to something that the CPU would produce from valid inputs is currently under-defined in the toolchain. (The GCC built-in and glibc disagree.)  The isnan check in PRINTF_FP_FETCH in stdio-common/printf_fp.c assumes the GCC behavior that returns true for non-normal numbers which are not specified as NaN. (The glibc implementation returns false for such numbers.)  At present, passing non-normal numbers to __mppn_extract_long_double causes this function to produce irregularly shaped multi-precision integers, triggering undefined behavior in __printf_fp_l.  With GCC 10 and glibc 2.32, this behavior is not visible because __builtin_isnan is used, which avoids calling __mppn_extract_long_double in this case. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=26649#c1)  Florian Weimer    2020-09-22 14:32:44 UTC  ``` Patch posted: <https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2020-September/117779.html> ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=26649#c2)  Florian Weimer    2020-09-22 17:15:29 UTC  ``` Fixed for glibc 2.33 via:  commit 681900d29683722b1cb0a8e565a0585846ec5a61 Author: Florian Weimer <fweimer@redhat.com> Date:   Tue Sep 22 19:07:48 2020 +0200      x86: Harden printf against non-normal long double values ([bug 26649](show_bug.cgi?id=26649 "RESOLVED FIXED - printf should handle non-normal x86 long double numbers gracefully (CVE-2020-29573)"))          The behavior of isnan/__builtin_isnan on bit patterns that do not     correspond to something that the CPU would produce from valid inputs     is currently under-defined in the toolchain. (The GCC built-in and     glibc disagree.)
