  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Missing access control check in `bug_actiongroup.php` when handling the `COPY` action.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with the ability to report new issues can use the `COPY` action to create a clone of any private issue. This clone includes all the private issue's data, including bugnotes and attachments, granting the attacker full access to confidential information.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "location": "The vulnerability lies in the `bug_actiongroup.php` file.",
      "method": "The attacker crafts a POST request to `bug_actiongroup_page.php` with the `action` parameter set to `COPY` and `bug_arr[]` set to the private issue's ID. After that, they select a target project and submit the form to `bug_actiongroup.php` to clone the issue.",
     "details": "The vulnerability can be exploited via the following steps:\n1.  Login as an unprivileged user that can report new issues.\n2.  Navigate to `http://path.to/mantisbt/bug_actiongroup_page.php?action=COPY&bug_arr[]=PRIVATE_ISSUE_ID`.\n3. Select a target project.\n4. Click the \"Copy Issues\" button.\n5. A new issue is created as a clone of the private issue, containing all the private data such as bugnotes and attachments."
    },
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have an account with the ability to report new issues. They do not need to be a member of the project containing the private issues."
