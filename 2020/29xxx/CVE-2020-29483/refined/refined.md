Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29483:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `xenstored` handles protocol violations from guest domains. When a guest violates the Xenstore communication protocol, `xenstored` drops the connection by removing the guest from its internal management. This action triggers an `@releaseDomain` event, mimicking a normal domain destruction. However, since the guest is still running, watchers of this event do not react as they would in a normal domain removal. Later, when the guest is actually destroyed, `xenstored` doesn't have it in its internal database, preventing a second `@releaseDomain` event. This leads to a "zombie" domain.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incomplete cleanup**: The improper handling of protocol violations leads to a state where guest resources (specifically memory mappings) are not cleaned up after the guest is removed from `xenstored`'s internal management.
*   **Use-after-free**: In the case of guests using a stub-domain device model, the premature removal from the internal database can lead to a use-after-free condition in `xenstored` when the domain is eventually destroyed.
*   **Missing event**: The lack of a second `@releaseDomain` event upon actual domain destruction causes resource leaks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Resource blocking**: A malicious guest can block resources of the host by causing a "zombie" domain state, delaying the cleanup of its memory mappings. This issue requires another domain to be destroyed before the zombie domain's resources are fully released.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: If a guest with a stub-domain device model triggers the vulnerability, it can lead to a use-after-free condition in `xenstored`, potentially causing a crash of the `xenstored` service. This would result in a more severe denial of service because it would prevent any further domain management operations.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Guest-initiated**: A malicious guest domain can trigger the vulnerability by violating the Xenstore communication protocol. This is done by sending malformed or unexpected messages via the shared memory page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have control over a guest domain running on a vulnerable Xen hypervisor.
*   For the more severe DoS, the attacker's guest domain must be using a stub-domain device model.

**Additional details:**

*   Only the C variant of `xenstored` is vulnerable; the Ocaml variant (`oxenstored`) is not affected.
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of Xen.
*   Patches are available to fix the issue, and these generally apply to stable branches.

In summary, CVE-2020-29483 is a vulnerability where a malicious guest can cause resource leaks and potentially crash `xenstored` by violating the Xenstore protocol, leading to incomplete domain cleanup and a potential use-after-free issue.
