| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=26923#c0)  Michael Colavita    2020-11-19 18:22:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 12978](attachment.cgi?id=12978 "An example of an iconv call that causes an assertion failure.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=12978&action=edit "An example of an iconv call that causes an assertion failure.") An example of an iconv call that causes an assertion failure.  When converting UCS4 containing an irreversible character, an assertion failure can occur within __gconv_transform_ucs4_internal. See attachment for an easy reproducible example. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=26923#c1)  Carlos O'Donell    2020-11-19 18:40:03 UTC  ``` I can confirm this causes an assertion failure.  test: ../iconv/skeleton.c:746: __gconv_transform_ucs4_internal: Assertion `outbuf == outerr' failed. Aborted (core dumped) ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=26923#c2)  Michael Colavita    2020-11-19 18:42:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to Carlos O'Donell from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=26923#c1)) > I can confirm this causes an assertion failure. >  > test: ../iconv/skeleton.c:746: __gconv_transform_ucs4_internal: Assertion > `outbuf == outerr' failed. > Aborted (core dumped)  I believe the root cause is due to improper bounds used when converting UCS4 to the internal UCS4-like format. I have submitted a patch that I believe should resolve the issue and explains the problem in a bit more depth. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=26923#c3)  Carlos O'Donell    2020-11-19 18:43:37 UTC  ``` Patch posted: <https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2020-November/119822.html> ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=26923#c4)  Pádraig Brady    2020-11-19 21:06:51 UTC  ``` The fix for [bug 18830](show_bug.cgi?id=18830 "RESOLVED FIXED - iconv -c -f ascii with >buffer size worth of input before invalid input drops valid char") may have been the trigger. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=26923#c5)  Siddhesh Poyarekar    2020-12-07 17:19:39 UTC  ``` Fixed in master.  commit 228edd356f03bf62dcf2b1335f25d43c602ee68d Author: Michael Colavita <mcolavita@fb.com> Date:   Thu Nov 19 11:44:40 2020 -0500      iconv: Fix incorrect UCS4 inner loop bounds (BZ#26923)          Previously, in UCS4 conversion routines we limit the number of     characters we examine to the minimum of the number of characters in the     input and the number of characters in the output. This is not the     correct behavior when __GCONV_IGNORE_ERRORS is set, as we do not consume     an output character when we skip a code unit. Instead, track the input     and output pointers and terminate the loop when either reaches its     limit.          This resolves assertion failures when resetting the input buffer in a step of     iconv, which assumes that the input will be fully consumed given sufficient     output space. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=26923#c6)  Sourceware Commits    2020-12-08 14:35:15 UTC  ``` The master branch has been updated by Siddhesh Poyarekar <siddhesh@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=glibc.git;h=38a9e93cb1c58e3c899d638480e6d6e42af8e6fc>  commit 38a9e93cb1c58e3c899d638480e6d6e42af8e6fc Author: Siddhesh Poyarekar <siddhesh@sourceware.org> Date:   Mon Dec 7 22:29:18 2020 +0530      Add NEWS entry for CVE-2020-29562 (BZ #26923)          BZ #26923 now has a CVE entry, so add a NEWS entry for it. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=26923#c7)  Sourceware Commits    2021-01-03 13:47:46 UTC  ``` The release/2.31/master branch has been updated by Aurelien Jarno <aurel32@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=glibc.git;h=0858f46440db4936303de0117908c1de7f4f8215>  commit 0858f46440db4936303de0117908c1de7f4f8215 Author: Siddhesh Poyarekar <siddhesh@sourceware.org> Date:   Mon Dec 7 22:29:18 2020 +0530      Add NEWS entry for CVE-2020-29562 (BZ #26923)          BZ #26923 now has a CVE entry, so add a NEWS entry for it.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-6e581c051a
2021-01-20 01:26:41.922155
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : glibc
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 2.31
Release : 5.fc32
URL : <http://www.gnu.org/software/glibc/>
Summary : The GNU libc libraries
Description :
The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular package
contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the standard C
library and the standard math library. Without these two libraries, a
Linux system will not function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- x86: Check IFUNC definition in unrelocated executable [BZ #20019] -
x86: Set header.feature\_1 in TCB for always-on CET [BZ #27177] - x86-64:
