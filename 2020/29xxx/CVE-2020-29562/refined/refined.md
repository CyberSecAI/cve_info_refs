{
  "CVE-2020-29562": {
    "Description": "Assertion failure in iconv when converting invalid UCS4",
    "Root cause": "Improper bounds used when converting UCS4 to the internal UCS4-like format.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect bounds checking in the UCS4 conversion routines within the iconv library, specifically when __GCONV_IGNORE_ERRORS is set."
    ],
    "Impact": "Assertion failure and program termination (abort). A denial of service can occur due to the crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Conversion of UCS4 data containing irreversible characters using iconv.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must provide input that triggers the faulty bounds checking logic, such as an irreversible character in a UCS4 input.",
    "Affected component": "glibc's iconv library",
    "More details": "The vulnerability occurs when the code limits the number of characters examined to the minimum of the number of characters in the input and the number of characters in the output. This is incorrect when  __GCONV_IGNORE_ERRORS is set, where output characters are not consumed when skipping an input code unit. The fix involves tracking input and output pointers, terminating the loop when either limit is reached."
