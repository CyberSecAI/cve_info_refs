  "CVE-2020-29583": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a hardcoded administrative account ('zyfwp') with a static plain-text password present in some Zyxel firewalls and AP controllers.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hardcoded credentials, use of plain-text password.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can gain administrative access to the affected devices, allowing them to intercept traffic, modify firewall settings, create VPN accounts, and perform other administrative functions, potentially compromising the entire network behind the device.",
      "Attack vectors": "Remote access via SSH or web interface on port 443.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs network access to the device and knowledge of the hardcoded 'zyfwp' user credentials."
    },
      {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The hardcoded account 'zyfwp' was created for automatic firmware updates to connected access points through FTP.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use of a static, plain-text password for an administrative account, lack of proper access control.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Full device compromise, including the ability to modify settings, intercept traffic, and create VPN accounts to access the network behind the device.",
      "Attack vectors": "Exploitation occurs remotely via SSH or the web interface, often exposed on port 443.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires network access to the device and knowledge of the hardcoded 'zyfwp' credentials. Publicly available data can be used to find vulnerable devices."
