Thank you for choosing ZyWALL ATP and USG FLEX series.
Zyxel is committed to continuously updating your devices for the most advanced
features. This latest release enhances all-round functions of ZyWALL products including:

**SSL
inspection and performance enhancements**

To prevent advanced
masqueraded attacks, we elevated security with TLS 1.3, while the enhanced SSL
inspection performance has gained up to 3-5 times faster.

**Enhanced
account security by Two-Factor Authentication**

Added an extra 2FA
protection for admin and VPN connection by SMS, email, and Google
Authentication. Safely let users use their personal devices to log in to the
private network for increased productivity.

**DNS
Reputation, powered by McAfee (ATP only)**

DNS Filter prevents
reaching those known domains hosting malicious content and reduces the risk of
phishing attacks, obfuscate source IPs using hijacked domain names.

**APC
3.60 supports new WiFi6 APs and provides more comprehensive features**

WAX510D, WAX650S
will be supported for full management, while the WPA3 support is added on 11AX
AP, CAPWAP enhancement, and more features will escalate the security and manageability.

Great news to all our USG *FLEX users, we've developed
a new* [*USG FLEX 100W*](https://www.zyxel.com/products_services/USG-FLEX-Firewall-USG-FLEX-100W/)*/*[*700*](https://www.zyxel.com/products_services/USG-FLEX-Firewall-USG-FLEX-700/) *for a comprehensive solution. USG FLEX 100W\*
integrates dual-radio WiFi for solid wireless performance. USG FLEX 700 brings a
complete suite of security subscription with seamless, scalable gateway
connectivity to SMBs*.

  It is available now.  I put it on my home system and it fixed an issue with L2TP/IPSEC VPN introduced with the last update. I have not had a chance to explore it much further yet.

  Is there any information about 2-Factor Authentication with Google Authentication?

  I only found information about usage for enhanced security to login in the Zyxel account webpage. The information above however could give the impression that this is also available for VPN connections.

### Take Patch Management Miles Ahead with the Industry Leading Patching Capabilities

 Automate Patching for Faster Deployment

Manual patching cycles are tedious and time-consuming. With the SanerNow automated patch management tool, configure end-to-end workflows for automatic patching and fix risks faster than ever. Schedule automated patching tasks and make patching a hands-free task. It also supports the upload of pre and post-remediation scripts.

 Test and Approve Patches for Zero-Disruption

Applying new patches directly to the production environment is risky. SanerNow patch management software enables you to create a test environment to test the new patches to verify compatibility. Later, deploy the approved patches across the devices in your production environment and prevent any disruptions and productivity errors.

 Perimeter-Less Patching with a Single, light-weight Agent

SanerNow auto patching software is an ideal solution for hybrid workforces. You can easily deploy patches across globally distributed devices from a centralized cloud patch management solution. Furthermore, all the patching tasks, from scanning to deployment, are executed by a single lightweight multifunctional agent installed in the endpoints. You can also go for the agent-less option, which is a unique approach to scanning while retaining the scan speed and accuracy.

 Risk based Prioritization to Deploy Patches Smartly

SanerNow auto patching tool thoroughly assesses the patches and prioritizes them based on their business context, technical impact, severity level, and more intelligence to help focus on critical patches immediately. Additionally, you can deploy these patches quickly to reduce risk exposure and plan your remediation efforts wisely.

 Firmware Patches for Complete Risk Mitigation

As important as the software application patches, firmware patches are critical to tightening IT security. Moreover, it is recommended to include firmware patching as you establish your automated patch management cadence to reduce security risk exposure. SanerNow patch manager supports patching for firmware updates to fix issues and errors in firmware.

 Continuous and Customizable Patch Scans to Identify Missing Patches

Move away from the periodic scans and make it a continuous process with SanerNow patch management software. Keep your patching up-to-date with customized, real-time, and continuous scans for verified patches based on your IT environment. You can additionally perform real-time, on-demand, scheduled, and automated patch scans with the SanerNow patch management tool.

 Cross-Platform Patching with Support for Third-Party Apps

SanerNow patch management tool supports multi-platform patching for all major operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, and 550+ third-party applications. SanerNow’s automated patching solution additionally maintains a pre-built patch repository for third-party application patches.

 Effortless Patch Rollback for an Error-Prone Patching

Patch rollback is made easier with the SanerNow automated patch management tool to avoid disruptions in business operations. It rollbacks the last stable version with zero downtime and a single click to easily deal with incompatible and error-prone software patches.

 Comply with Industry Benchmarks and Security Standards

Various industry regulatory standards and organizations mandate patch compliance. SanerNow auto patch management software provides a unified view of your software patch compliance to address deviations from compliance standards and deploy patches accordingly. However, with auto patching in SanerNow, you can quickly fix the misconfigurations and achieve compliance with regulatory standards.

 Insights and Tracking with Reports and Audit Logs

Track detailed insights on your patching metrics with auto-generated reports and an inbuilt audit log. SanerNow automated patch management software provides a wide range of reports to assess the patching status in your network. Additionally, SanerNow provides an insightful Patch Impact Report to analyze the impact of patches and track the patching activities.

![](https://www.secpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Asset-12@4x-8-1024x954-3.webp)

*“SanerNow’s patch management capabilities stand out from the competition since it can patch all the discovered vulnerabilities and perform other system-hardening actions. Even if no direct remediation is available, SanerNow applies security controls that provide workarounds for the* *vulnerabilities.”*

### Test & Approve Patches before Deploying

Directly applying patches to your working environment is risky.

# Secret Backdoor to Zyxel Firewall and AP Controllers Could Allow Administrative Access

* Post author:[Kumarswamy S](https://www.secpod.com/blog/author/kumarswamys/ "Posts by Kumarswamy S")
* Post published:January 6, 2021

Niels Teusink of Dutch cybersecurity firm EYE has recently discovered a secret backdoor to Zyxel devices. More than 100,000 Zyxel Firewall and AP Controllers of version 4.60 [patch](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/) 0 are affected by this [vulnerability](https://www.secpod.com/vulnerability-management/) (CVE-2020-29583). A [vulnerability management solution](https://www.secpod.com/vulnerability-management/) can be helpful here. It is due to a hardcoded administrative account.

---

## Vulnerabilities Details ([CVE-2020-29583](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29583))

A hardcoded credential vulnerability was in some Zyxel devices in the “zyfwp” user account. The account has the login name “zyfwp” with administrative privileges and a static plain-text password. The user account was created to address automatic firmware updates to connected access points through FTP. The vulnerability could allow remote attackers to have administrative access. This allows attackers to use the “zyfwp” user account to log in remotely and take over the Zyxel device. As a result, it could also allow attackers to intercept traffic, firewall settings, create VPN accounts to gain access to the network behind the device, and perform other administrative functions. To avoid such attacks, we can use a [patch management solution](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/) and patch the vulnerabilities.

```
$ ssh [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
Password: Pr*******Xp
Router> show users current
No: 1
  Name: zyfwp
  Type: admin
(...)
Router>
```

Teusink [reported](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29583): “*As SSL VPN on these devices operates on the same port as the web interface, a lot of users have exposed port 443 of these devices to the internet. Using publicly available data from Project Sonar, I was able to identify about 3.000 Zyxel USG/ATP/VPN devices in the Netherlands. Globally, more than 100000 devices have exposed their web interface to the internet.”*

Attackers are actively scanning for the Zyxel backdoor. Recently cybersecurity GreyNoise detected that hackers are trying to exploit this backdoor, three different IP addresses [actively scanning for SSH devices](https://viz.greynoise.io/query/?gnql=tags%3A%22Zyxel%20USG%20SSH%20Backdoor%20Attempt%22) and trying to login using the Zyxel backdoor credentials. When it detects SSH, the attacker will try to brute force using Zyxel ‘zyfwp’ backdoor account.

---

## Impact

The vulnerability could allow remote attackers to have administrative access. This allows attackers to use the “zyfwp” user account to log in remotely and take over the Zyxel device.
