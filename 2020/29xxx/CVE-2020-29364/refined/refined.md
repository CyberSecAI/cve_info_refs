Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29364:

**1. Verification:**

The content from `github.com_573721c6_20250119_142809.html` and `github.com_ec2e41eb_20250119_130150.html` directly references CVE-2020-29364 and describes a vulnerability in "NewsLister". The content from `www.netartmedia.net_469955c2_20250119_130150.html` is the vendor page for NewsLister. Therefore, these contents are **RELATED** to the CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the news title, within the NewsLister application.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability is a **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. This occurs because the application stores the unsanitized user input (the malicious payload in the news title) and then displays it later to other users without proper encoding or sanitization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the title field of a news post. This script would then execute in the browsers of any user who views the affected news item. This allows the attacker to potentially:
    *   Steal cookies/session information
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user
    *   Deface the web page

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the administrative interface of the NewsLister application, specifically during the creation or editing of news articles.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have valid administrative credentials to access the NewsLister admin panel.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create or edit news posts.

**3. Technical Details from the PoC:**

The exploit content from `github.com_573721c6_20250119_142809.html` provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) and an HTTP request example to illustrate how the vulnerability is exploited:

*   **PoC steps:**
    1.  Log in to the NewsLister admin panel.
    2.  Enter a malicious JavaScript payload into the "title" field when adding or editing a news item (e.g., `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`).
    3.  View the news item; the XSS payload will execute.
*   **HTTP Request (Example):**
    *   The GET request to `/admin/index.php?page=add` indicates the vulnerable functionality is within the add/edit news page of the admin panel.
    *   The `Cookie: AuthUser=...` shows that the user must be authenticated to perform the malicious actions.

**4. Additional Notes**
* The provided content gives more detail than a typical CVE description which would usually summarize the vulnerability and its potential impact but not include the PoC.

**In summary, CVE-2020-29364 is a persistent XSS vulnerability in the NewsLister PHP script, which allows an authenticated administrator to inject malicious JavaScript into news titles, leading to potential security breaches for viewers of the affected news items.**
