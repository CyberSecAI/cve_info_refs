Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the WonderCMS application when handling user-supplied data. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or encode the 'Page Keywords' and 'Page Title' parameters before storing and rendering them, resulting in a persistent XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This occurs when malicious JavaScript code is stored on the server (in this case, within page data), and then executed in the browsers of users who visit the affected pages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'Page Keywords' or 'Page Title'. This malicious script can then be executed in the browser of any user that visits the affected page.
- A successful exploit could allow an attacker to:
    - Steal user session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to accounts.
    - Take over the administrator account, if the administrator views the page containing the malicious script.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Perform other malicious actions within the user's browser context.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into the 'Page Keywords' or 'Page Title' fields within the WonderCMS website builder interface.
- The injected code is stored persistently in the application's data storage and triggered when any user visits the relevant page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the WonderCMS website builder interface. This typically requires a user account with appropriate permissions, though the exact level of access needed isn't specified.
- The attacker needs to be able to input malicious code into the 'Page Keywords' or 'Page Title' fields.
- No specific network position is needed, the attacker could be on the same LAN or remote as long as they can access the website builder interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in WonderCMS version 3.1.3.
- The exploit was tested on PopOS.
- The provided exploit payload is `Mayur"><img src=x onerror=confirm("XSS")>`. This payload demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the page context.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Stored" or "Persistent" XSS.
- The exploit report mentions that WonderCMS acknowledged the vulnerability and added the reporter to their Hall of Fame.
