Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-29007:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the Mediawiki Score extension's use of the GNU Lilypond binary to generate musical notation. Specifically, the Lilypond binary was being executed without the `-dsafe` option. This allowed for arbitrary Guile Scheme code, embedded within user-provided Lilypond markup, to be executed. This included the ability to execute operating system shell commands, access the filesystem, and potentially interact with the network.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Static Code Injection (CWE-96):** The primary vulnerability is the improper neutralization of directives in statically saved code. User-provided Lilypond markup, containing malicious Scheme code, is processed by Lilypond without proper sanitization, leading to code execution.
*   **Insecure Lilypond Execution:** The lack of the `-dsafe` option when executing the Lilypond binary allowed for unrestricted access to Guile Scheme functionalities, which include system commands, file system interaction, and network operations.
*   **Insufficient Sandboxing:** The intended sandboxing mechanism (firejail) was not initially configured correctly, and subsequent bypasses of the lilypond safe mode were also identified.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most significant impact is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the web server. This can lead to a full compromise of the server, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt services.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can read sensitive data from the server's filesystem, including configuration files, database credentials, and potentially user data.
*   **System Manipulation:** Attackers can execute system commands to modify system settings, create new user accounts, or carry out other malicious actions.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although not explicitly detailed, the ability to execute commands could potentially be used to cause a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wikitext Injection:** The vulnerability can be exploited by embedding malicious Lilypond markup containing Scheme code within any editable wiki page.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** In many configurations, unauthenticated users can edit wiki pages, making it easier for attackers to leverage the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to edit wiki pages:** Attackers need to be able to edit articles on the vulnerable wiki. In many cases, this requires no authentication.
*   **Knowledge of Lilypond and Scheme:**  Attackers need knowledge of Lilypond's syntax and the ability to embed Scheme code to execute commands.
*   **No special network access required**: The attack is launched directly from the wiki.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content details a series of security issues with the Score extension, with CVE-2020-29007 being the initial RCE vulnerability.
*   The content also includes details about the mitigations applied by the Wikimedia Foundation. These include disabling the Score extension, removing the Lilypond package from the app servers, and later re-enabling it with a more robust sandboxing using Shellbox, firejail, and safe mode.
*   The documents also cover upstream fixes to Lilypond and communication efforts with the Lilypond project.
