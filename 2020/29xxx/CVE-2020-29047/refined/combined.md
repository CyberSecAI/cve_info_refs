# Advisory: CVE-2020-29047 – Unauthenticated RCE via Arbitrary Object Deserialisation in WordPress Hotel Booking Plugin

CVE: CVE-2020-29047
Severity: HIGH
Vulnerability Type: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Requires Authentication: No

It is possible to gain **Unauthenticated [Remote Code Execution](https://appcheck-ng.com/remote-code-execution/)** (RCE) on any **WordPress** instance that is using this plugin due to the unsafe use of *maybe\_unserialize* for the parsing of unsanitised user input, via the cookie *thimpress\_hotel\_booking\_1* used within *includes/class-wphb-sessions.php*

CVE: **[CVE-2020-29047](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-29047)**Severity: **HIGH**

Vulnerability Type: **CWE-502**: Deserialization of Untrusted Data

Requires Authentication: **No**

### Timeline

Discovered: **2020-11-17** – Nick Blundell, AppCheck Ltd

Contacted Vendor: 2020-11-17

Reported to Vendor: 2020-11-18

Fixed: **2020-12-08**

### Affected Software

Name: **WP Hotel Booking**

URL: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-hotel-booking/>

Vendor: Thimpress (<https://thimpress.com/>)

Vulnerable versions:  **< 1.10.3**Google Dork: inurl:”/wp-content/plugins/wp-hotel-booking/”

### Affected Components

The following code **deserialises** the cookie value sent from the user, such that **arbitrary code** may be injected:

```
// File: includes/class-wphb-sessions.php

public function load() {
    if ( isset( $_SESSION[ $this->prefix ] ) ) {
        return $_SESSION[ $this->prefix ];
    } else if ( $this->remember && isset( $_COOKIE[ $this->prefix ] ) ) {
        return $_SESSION[ $this->prefix ] = maybe_unserialize( $_COOKIE[ $this->prefix ] );
    }  //                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    return array();
}

```
###

### Exploitation Demo

Exploitation of PHP serialisation vulnerabilities involves leveraging a collection of *gadget* classes that are already present within the vulnerable application, such as third party libraries, in such a way that arbitrary code execution (or some other malicious action) is executed when that *chain* of gadget classes is [*deserialised*](https://appcheck-ng.com/deserialisation-vulnerabilities/).   See references below for more details on this class of vulnerability and its exploitation.

# “RCE” Primer: Remote Code Execution

Remote code execution (RCE) is the term used to describe the execution of arbitrary code on a system where the attacker does not have direct access to the console. Any vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute code or commands on remote system where this was not intended can be said to result in RCE.

### Introduction / Background

Internet-enabled applications such as web application (HTTP) servers, domain name (DNS) and email (SMTP) servers operate on the basis of a client-server model in which clients (typically customers and other end users) send requests for content, data or information to servers, via a locally installed agent (e.g. a web browser in the case of web applications). The requested content resides in storage as data on deployed servers (either physical or virtual) that are located in data centres, colocation facilities, server rooms/server farms and public cloud infrastructure.

In order to serve responses to clients, some minimal amount of processing and calculation is needed on the server’s part to process the request to perform actions such as process metadata contained in the request, and to make logic-based decisions on what data to include in the response, or to check access to the resource requested. Webservers, email servers and other network-accessible servers used in modern e-commerce are therefore not “dumb” storage devices, but typically highly performant and complex computing devices that house a significant amount of code devoted to handling and processing requests from clients or peer server devices. This code is layered as in any computer on top of a “stack” of software and hardware in *layers* from the application down to the operating system and finally hardware.

Since all computer code is essentially processed by the server’s processing architecture (CPU) as a string of 1s and 0s, there is (by default) no distinction at the lowest level between “code” and “data” unless specific protection measures are applied.

### Remote Code Execution (RCE)

Remote code execution (RCE) is the term used to describe the execution of arbitrary code on a system where the attacker does not have direct access to the console. Any vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute code or commands on remote systems where this was not intended can be said to result in RCE. However typically it is possible to send data to a server in such a way that the server becomes confused on the boundary between (untrusted and user-derived) *data* that it has been sent in a request and the (trusted and deployed on the server) *code* that it executes to handle requests – effectively a remote user is able to send (usually malicious) code to the server that is then natively executed on that server in a trusted environment as if it had been deployed to the server by its owner from a trusted source.

### Low Level

Remote or arbitrary code execution relies at an architectural level on the ability to specify control over an item known as the *instruction address register,* *instruction pointer* or *program counter* of a running process. The instruction pointer points to the next instruction in the process that will be executed. Being able to inject data into the contents of the instruction pointer therefore gives control over which instruction is executed next. In order to execute arbitrary code, RCE exploits inject code that changes the instruction pointer to have it point to the injected code rather than the next instruction in memory. The injected code will then automatically get executed.

[*Data Execution Prevention (DEP)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_space_protection) exists to try and enforce a distinction between *code* and *data* at the operating system level – which can be effective for some RCE types in compiled languages – but is completely ineffective for vulnerabilities such as *deserialisation* (described in detail later in this article) in interpreted languages.

### Remote Code Execution Example

When a webserver receives a request from a client, code is executed to handle the request using the data contained in the request as parameters that influence the response that is sent. For example, in the case of a web request, in requesting the URL **http://www.example.com?user=1&page=7** a parameter of **“*1*”** has been passed in for the userID which is used as part of an operating system command. If instead of a simple “1” (data – in this case an integer) a remote user is instead able to send in a parameter that breaks out of the intended context and influence the command executed by the server, then *remote code execution* has occurred.

For example *injecting* “meta” characters (such as backslashes (), ampersands (&), dollar ($), back ticks (`), and semi-colons(;)) in the parameter which will be embedded without sanitisation in an operating system command can allow us to execute our own commands.

The above is just one very specific example, but RCE can exist within any server technologies where client requests are submitted by end users – web servers, email (SMTP, POP3, and IMAP) servers, file transfer servers, DNS servers, NTP servers, and many more.

Other variants are described down in this article under the “Attack Vectors and Variants” section

### Impact of Remote Code Execution

Remote Code Execution has the ability to impact all three key security concerns relating to an operating webserver:

* **Data Confidentiality** – the remote user could instruct the server to execute code to retrieve any data it contains (even if the user would not typically be able to access that data) such as other user’s sensitive data;
* **Data Integrity** – the remote user could instruct the server to modify data records that they should not be able to (for example rewrite their bank balance); and
* **System & Data Availability** – the remote user could simply send a command for the server to execute that simply wipes all its data, or shuts the server down (if combined with a *privilege escalation* vulnerability, typically).

In addition to these three immediate concerns, a malicious attacker who gains remote access to a server in this way can convert an immediate breach into an ongoing security concern in which a remote attacker, rather than performing an immediately malicious action to cause immediate or opportunistic harm or damage that reveals their presence, instead chooses to use the access gained to remain undetected for an extended period, while leveraging the access to gain more serious long-term access. This is the approach often favoured by an *Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)*. This typically involves installing a *backdoor* for ongoing access even in the case that the vulnerability allowing initial access (for example RCE) is fixed, as well as using the compromised server to perform onward attacks known as *pivot (or lateral) attacks* to other servers. They may also seek to escalate the privilege level of their current access and give themselves time to probe the server and exfiltrate higher value data.

### Attack Vectors & Variants

RCE vulnerabilities are all based on code that permits a confusion between handled data and executed code, but variants (not covered in detail in this article) may include *buffer overflows* and [*deserialization vulnerabilities*](https://appcheck-ng.com/deserialisation-vulnerabilities/)  (there are other, less common types also):

* **Buffer overflow** – memory partitions known as *buffers* are used to contain set (pre-determined) amounts of data. When programs do not include *bounds-checking* on received input (e.g. when 60kb of data is sent by a user and then written to a buffer designed to hold only 50kb of data) then the input exceeds the allocated memory space. In this scenario, the buffer is said to *overflow* and, if vulnerable, an application may overwrite memory in adjacent buffers. Those buffers could have held important data, which is now overwritten (affecting data integrity). Alternatively, those buffers could also have held *control instructions* telling the processor what to do next – if a user can replace their contents with their own control instructions then they have successfully performed an RCE attack.
* **Deserialization** – Data represented by *objects* such as JSON must be serialized (converted into binary) in order to be transmitted over a network. To utilise this data, a receiving program must then deserialise it, converting it back into an object that the application can process. By manipulating the serialised data that is submitted to an application as part of an HTTP request, malicious users can produce altered objects that cause the program to execute unintended programming upon deserialisation.
* [**SQL Injection**](https://appcheck-ng.com/an-introduction-to-sql-injection-sqli/) – This is entire vulnerability category of its own involving the unsafe concatenation of user input into SQL queries, however it may be possible to leverage it to achieve RCE utilising database features such as xp\_cmdshell on Microsoft SQL Server.

### How can AppCheck Help?

AppCheck can help screen for known and vendor-published remote code execution vulnerabilities in underlying operating systems, applications and web server software hosted on a given server; as well as detecting previously-unknown RCE vulnerabilities in deployed in-house code, from first-principles deduction.

AppCheck draws on checks for known vulnerabilities in vendor devices and installed utilities and software from a large database of published vulnerabilities known as CVEs. AppCheck also scans web applications for injection vulnerabilities from first principles, discovering potential injection points that may indicate a lack of input sanitisation which could lead to remote code execution.

The AppCheck Vulnerability Analysis Engine provides detailed rationale behind each finding including a custom narrative to explain the detection methodology, verbose technical detail, and proof-of-concept evidence through safe exploitation.

# PHP Object Injection

Thank you for visiting OWASP.org. We have migrated our community to a new web platform and regretably the content for this page needed to be programmatically ported from its previous wiki page. There’s still some work to be done.

This is an example of a Project or Chapter Page.

**Author:** Egidio Romano

Author(s):

## Description

PHP Object Injection is an application level vulnerability that could
allow an attacker to perform different kinds of malicious attacks, such
as [Code Injection](Code_Injection "wikilink"), [SQL
Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection), [Path
Traversal](Path_Traversal "wikilink") and [Application Denial of
Service](Application_Denial_of_Service "wikilink"), depending on the
context. The vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is not
properly sanitized before being passed to the unserialize() PHP
function. Since PHP allows object serialization, attackers could pass
ad-hoc serialized strings to a vulnerable unserialize() call, resulting
in an arbitrary PHP object(s) injection into the application scope.

In order to successfully exploit a PHP Object Injection vulnerability
two conditions must be met:

* The application must have a class which implements a PHP magic
  method (such as \_\_wakeup or \_\_destruct) that can be used to
  carry out malicious attacks, or to start a “POP chain”.
* All of the classes used during the attack must be declared when the
  vulnerable unserialize() is being called, otherwise object
  autoloading must be supported for such classes.

## Examples

**Example 1**

The example below shows a PHP class with an exploitable \_\_destruct
method:

```
class Example1
{
   public $cache_file;

   function __construct()
   {
      // some PHP code...
   }

   function __destruct()
   {
      $file = "/var/www/cache/tmp/{$this->cache_file}";
      if (file_exists($file)) @unlink($file);
   }
}

// some PHP code...

$user_data = unserialize($_GET['data']);

// some PHP code...

```

In this example an attacker might be able to delete an arbitrary file
via a [Path Traversal](Path_Traversal "wikilink") attack, for e.g.
requesting the following URL:

```
http://testsite.com/vuln.php?data=O:8:"Example1":1:{s:10:"cache_file";s:15:"../../index.php";}

```

**Example 2**

The example below shows a PHP class with an exploitable \_\_wakeup
method:

```
class Example2
{
   private $hook;

   function __construct()
   {
      // some PHP code...
   }

   function __wakeup()
   {
      if (isset($this->hook)) eval($this->hook);
   }
}

// some PHP code...

$user_data = unserialize($_COOKIE['data']);

// some PHP code...

```

In this example an attacker might be able to perform a [Code
Injection](Code_Injection "wikilink") attack by sending an HTTP request
like this:

```
GET /vuln.php HTTP/1.0
Host: testsite.com
Cookie: data=O%3A8%3A%22Example2%22%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A14%3A%22%00Example2%00hook%22%3Bs%3A10%3A%22phpinfo%28%29%3B%22%3B%7D
Connection: close

```

Where the cookie parameter “data” has been generated by the following
script:

```
class Example2
{
   private $hook = "phpinfo();";
}

print urlencode(serialize(new Example2));

```

**Example 3**

This last example shows how it is possible to perform a [SQL
Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection) attack using a “POP chain”, for
instance by leveraging a \_\_toString method like this:

```
class Example3
{
   protected $obj;

   function __construct()
   {
      // some PHP code...
   }

   function __toString()
   {
      if (isset($this->obj)) return $this->obj->getValue();
   }
}

// some PHP code...

$user_data = unserialize($_POST['data']);

// some PHP code...

```

If the $user\_data variable is an “Example3” object and it will be
treated like a string somewhere in the code, then its \_\_toString
method will be called. Since this method will call the getValue method
of the object stored into the “obj” property, it’s possible to set that
property to an arbitrary object, and execute its getValue method, if it
is accessible, otherwise its \_\_call method will be called, if it is
defined. For the sake of ease, just think that when unserialize() is
called, the class below is available within the application scope (or
supported by autoloading):

```
class SQL_Row_Value
{
   private $_table;

   // some PHP code...

   function getValue($id)
   {
      $sql = "SELECT * FROM {$this->_table} WHERE id = " . (int)$id;
      $result = mysql_query($sql, $DBFactory::getConnection());
      $row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);

      return $row['value'];
   }
}

```

In this example an attacker might be able to perform a [SQL
Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection) attack by sending a POST request
containing a “data” parameter generated by a script like this:

```
class SQL_Row_Value
{
   private $_table = "SQL Injection";
}

class Example3
{
   protected $obj;

   function __construct()
   {
      $this->obj = new SQL_Row_Value;
   }
}

print urlencode(serialize(new Example3));

```

## Prevention

Do not use unserialize() function with user-supplied input, use JSON
functions instead.

| Table of Contents • [Table of Contents](/www-project-top-ten/2017/) | About OWASP The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications and APIs that can be trusted.   At OWASP, you’ll find free and open: \* Application security tools and standards. \* Complete books on application security testing, secure code development, and secure code review. \* Presentations and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/OWASPGLOBAL). \* [Cheat sheets](https://owasp.org/www-project-cheat-sheets/) on many common topics. \* Standard security controls and libraries. \* [Local chapters worldwide](https://owasp.org/chapters/). \* Cutting edge research. \* Extensive [conferences worldwide](https://owasp.org/events/). \* [Mailing lists](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!overview).  Learn more at: https://owasp.org.  All OWASP tools, documents, videos, presentations, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security.  We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem, because the most effective approaches to application security require improvements in these areas.  OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical, and cost-effective information about application security.  OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although we support the informed use of commercial security technology. OWASP produces many types of materials in a collaborative, transparent, and open way.  The OWASP Foundation is the non-profit entity that ensures the project’s long-term success. Almost everyone associated with OWASP is a volunteer, including the OWASP board, chapter leaders, project leaders, and project members. We support innovative security research with grants and infrastructure.  Come join us! |
