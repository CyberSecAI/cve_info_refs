Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-29072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application uses a pattern called "Server-Generated Javascript Responses." This method bypasses cross-origin protections by returning data as Javascript code, similar to JSONP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data, such as email content and message details (recipients, subject, file names, sizes, sent and expiry dates, download counts) is exposed through Javascript responses.
- **Lack of proper access control**: Various endpoints return sensitive information as Javascript without proper authorization checks.
- **Cross-Origin Bypass**: The server-generated javascript responses bypass cross-origin restrictions allowing for the embedding of the vulnerable endpoint on a malicious website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can steal sensitive information about previously sent encrypted messages by embedding the vulnerable endpoint in a malicious website.
- **Full Message Disclosure**: After obtaining message IDs, the attacker can retrieve the content of the messages using another vulnerable endpoint.
- Attackers can retrieve user information and potentially use it in other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Client-Side Exploitation:** An attacker would need to lure a logged-in user to access a malicious webpage or a webpage controlled by the attacker.
- **Embedded Malicious Content**: The attacker embeds a malicious script into a webpage or sends a malicious link, which, when accessed by a logged-in user, would then execute the vulnerable endpoint, leaking sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoints:** The attacker must be aware of the specific URLs that return data using the "Server-Generated Javascript Responses" pattern (e.g. `/messages/sent?format=js`, `/message/<ID>/popup?format=js`).
- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host a web page or send a malicious link to a victim.
- **Victim Interaction**: The victim must be logged into the LiquidFiles application and must visit the attacker's malicious page in their browser.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is not limited to the examples given and approximately 109 ERB views were found to be vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is fixed in LiquidFiles Virtual Appliance v3.3.19 or higher.
