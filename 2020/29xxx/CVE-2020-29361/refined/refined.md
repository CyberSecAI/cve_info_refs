{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple integer overflows in array allocations within the p11-kit library and the `p11-kit list` command, due to missing overflow checks before calling `realloc` or `calloc`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing crafted input that causes large values when allocating arrays of attributes and object identifiers via the RPC protocol or the command line tool.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to trigger the allocation of arrays using the vulnerable functions."
  },
  "patches": [
    {
      "version": "0.23.22",
      "details": "The upstream 0.23.22 release should fix the issue, by using `reallocarray` more extensively."
