# Zero Day: cPanel® and WHM® Vulnerability

By Fortra Staff

#### ***Two-Factor Authentication Bypass Flaw Could Affect Over 70 Million Domains***

**San Antonio, TX – November 24, 2020** – [Digital Defense, Inc.](https://www.digitaldefense.com/), a leader in [vulnerability and threat management solutions](https://www.digitaldefense.com/platform/), today announced that its [Vulnerability Research Team (VRT)](https://www.digitaldefense.com/technologies/ddi-vrt/) uncovered a previously undisclosed vulnerability affecting the cPanel & WebHost Manager (WHM) web hosting platform. cPanel &WHM version 11.90.0.5 (90.0 Build 5) exhibits a two-factor authentication bypass flaw, vulnerable to brute force attack, resulting in a scenario where an attacker with knowledge of or access to valid credentials could bypass two-factor authentication protections on an account. Digital Defense’s internal testing demonstrated that an attack can be accomplished in minutes.

> *“Our standard practice is to work in tandem with organizations on a coordinated disclosure effort to facilitate a prompt resolution to a vulnerability. The Digital Defense VRT reached out to cPanel who worked diligently on a patch. We will continue outreach to customers ensuring they are aware and able to take action to mitigate any potential risk introduced by the vulnerability,” states Mike Cotton, senior vice president of engineering at Digital Defense."*

cPanel & WHM is a suite of tools built for Linux OS that allows hosting providers and users the ability to automate server management and web hosting tasks while simplifying the process of website hosting for the end user. Serving the global hosting community for over 20 years, cPanel touts having over 70 million domains launched on servers using cPanel & WHM to date.

**What You Can Do**

cPanel’s recent advisory provides more details about the updates that have been released, which should be applied: <https://news.cpanel.com/cpanel-tsr-2020-0007-full-disclosure/>. For additional information, customers should contact cPanel directly.

### cPanel TSR-2020-0007 Full Disclosure

November 17, 2020
### SEC-567

**Summary**

URL parameter injection vulnerabilities in multiple interfaces.

**Security Rating**

cPanel has assigned this vulnerability a CVSSv3.1 score of 2.6 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

**Description**

Many cPanel & WHM interfaces create URIs to other interfaces by incorporating user-supplied data in URI query parameters. Several cPanel & WHM interfaces were using URL encoding on these parameters rather than URI encoding. Due to this mistake, a cPanel & WHM user could be misled into performing actions they did not intend.

**Credits**

This issue was discovered by the cPanel Security Team.

**Solution**

This issue is resolved in the following builds:
11.92.0.2
11.90.0.17
11.86.0.32

### SEC-575

**Summary**

Two factor authentication vulnerable to brute force attack.

**Security Rating**

cPanel has assigned this vulnerability a CVSSv3.1 score of 4.3 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

**Description**

The two-factor authentication cPanel Security Policy did not prevent an attacker from repeatedly submitting two-factor authentication codes. This allowed an attacker to bypass the two-factor authentication check using brute force techniques. Failed validation of the two-factor authentication code is now treated as equivalent to a failure of the account’s primary password validation and rate limited by cPHulk.

**Credits**

This issue was discovered by Michael Clark and Wes Wright of Digital Defense, Inc.

**Solution**

This issue is resolved in the following builds:
11.92.0.2
11.90.0.17
11.86.0.32

### SEC-577

**Summary**

Self-XSS vulnerability in WHM Transfer Tool interface.

**Security Rating**

cPanel has assigned this vulnerability a CVSSv3.1 score of 4.7 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**Description**

Error messages in the WHM Transfer Tool Interface were not properly encoded. This allowed the injection of HTML into some error messages displayed for invalid inputs.

**Credits**

This issue was discovered by the cPanel Security Team.

**Solution**

This issue is resolved in the following builds:
11.92.0.2
11.90.0.17
