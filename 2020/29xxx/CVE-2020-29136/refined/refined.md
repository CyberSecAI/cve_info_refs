Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-29136 (based on the content and the fact that the article refers to "SEC-575" which matches CVE-2020-29136)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The two-factor authentication (2FA) implementation in cPanel & WHM did not properly prevent repeated submissions of 2FA codes, failing to implement rate limiting on failed attempts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Brute-force vulnerability:** The lack of rate limiting on 2FA attempts allowed attackers to bypass 2FA through brute-force attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers could bypass 2FA protection on user accounts if they have access to valid credentials (usernames and passwords).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via repeated attempts to authenticate with different 2FA codes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Credentials:** An attacker needs to know or have access to a valid username and password for a cPanel & WHM account.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the cPanel & WHM login interface to launch the brute force attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Digital Defense, Inc.
- cPanel has issued a fix in versions 11.92.0.2, 11.90.0.17, and 11.86.0.32.
- The fix implemented rate limiting using cPHulk (cPanel's brute force protection system), treating failed 2FA attempts similarly to failed password attempts.
