### Potential Information Disclosure caused by default signup roles

Zammad comes with a functionality to add define custom Roles a newly created User gets assigned automatically e.g. by sending an email or manually creating an account. It was possible for an Administrator to assign privileged Roles for newly created Users allowing them to access restricted parts of Zammad resulting in a potential Information Disclosure.

This vulnerability is fixed in the latest versions of Zammad and it is recommended to upgrade to one of these.

## [Note](#note)

Per default the following permissions can now be used for a "default\_at\_signup" role: 'user\_preferences', 'user\_preferences.password', 'user\_preferences.notifications', 'user\_preferences.access\_token',

'user\_preferences.language', 'user\_preferences.linked\_accounts', 'user\_preferences.device', 'user\_preferences.avatar', 'user\_preferences.calendar', 'user\_preferences.out\_of\_office' and 'ticket.customer'.

Fixed releases can be found at:
