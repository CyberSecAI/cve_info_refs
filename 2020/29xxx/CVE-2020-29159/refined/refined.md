Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-29159 (Pending, according to the advisory)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of an administrator to assign privileged roles to newly created users via the "default_at_signup" functionality. This allowed new users to potentially access restricted parts of the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Privilege Assignment:** The core issue is that the system allowed assigning roles with excessive permissions for default signup, potentially granting new users access to sensitive areas.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to information that should not be available to users with the default signup role.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potential Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to restricted areas of Zammad, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Administrator Configuration:** An attacker would need to have administrative access to the Zammad instance to configure the "default_at_signup" role with privileged permissions.
- **User Creation:** Once the administrator has configured the vulnerable role, the attacker would create a new user account using the signup mechanism (e.g., email or manual account creation) to inherit the privileged role.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs administrative privileges to configure the roles.
- **Ability to Create User:** The attacker would then need the ability to create a new user in the system.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The vulnerability affects Zammad versions 1.0.x up to 3.5.0.
- It is fixed in versions 3.5.1 and 3.6.0.
- The fix restricts the default signup role to only include the following permissions: 'user\_preferences', 'user\_preferences.password', 'user\_preferences.notifications', 'user\_preferences.access\_token', 'user\_preferences.language', 'user\_preferences.linked\_accounts', 'user\_preferences.device', 'user\_preferences.avatar', 'user\_preferences.calendar', 'user\_preferences.out\_of\_office', and 'ticket.customer'.
- The provided git commit shows code changes related to adding an `allow_signup` column to the permissions table, modifying the role model to check for signup permissions, and updating the database migrations and seed data to set appropriate defaults.
