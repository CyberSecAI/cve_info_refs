Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-29284 (Although the exploit-db entry does not list the CVE, the Github README references it and the vulnerability information matches.)

**Root Cause:**
- The `view-chair-list.php` file in the Multi Restaurant Table Reservation System does not properly validate the `table_id` parameter. This lack of input validation allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `table_id` GET parameter in the `view-chair-list.php` file. This injection is unauthenticated, meaning an attacker does not need to log in to exploit it.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database.
- **Database Manipulation:** The attacker can use SQL injection to execute arbitrary SQL queries to the database.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The attacker can extract sensitive information like user credentials, restaurant data, etc.
- **Possible Full System Compromise:** In severe cases, an attacker might gain complete control over the database server, and potentially the system on which the web application resides.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted GET request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/dashboard/view-chair-list.php`).
- **Malicious `table_id` Parameter:** The attack vector is injecting malicious SQL code in the `table_id` parameter within the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `view-chair-list.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `table_id` (GET parameter)
*   **Exploitation Methods:**
    *   **Time-based blind SQL injection:** By injecting a sleep function, the attacker can determine if the injection is successful by observing the response time.
        ```
        GET /TableReservation/dashboard/view-chair-list.php?table_id='+AND+(SELECT+1+FROM+(SELECT(SLEEP(10)))a)--+- HTTP/1.1
        ```
    *   **UNION-based SQL injection:** By using the `UNION` statement, the attacker can extract information from the database.
        ```
        GET /TableReservation/dashboard/view-chair-list.php?table_id=%27%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%20CONCAT%280x7176787071%2CIFNULL%28CAST%28CURRENT_USER%28%29%20AS%20NCHAR%29%2C0x20%29%2C0x71716b7071%29%2CNULL%2CNULL--%20- HTTP/1.1
        ```
