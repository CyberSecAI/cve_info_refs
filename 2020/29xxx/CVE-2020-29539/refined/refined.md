Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which matches CVE-2020-29539:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied content when processing web page translations. Specifically, when a user requests a translation of a URL, the Systran server fetches the content of that URL and displays it in a new tab. However, the server does not properly sanitize or encode the fetched content, which leads to the execution of embedded JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. This occurs when the Systran server proxies the content of the requested URL, including any malicious JavaScript, and renders it in the user's browser, thus allowing the execution of the attacker's script within the user's session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a webpage and have that code executed in the context of a victim user's browser when they load that page for translation via Systran.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal the user's session cookies by using JavaScript, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the user's Systran account.
- **Malware Distribution:** An attacker can redirect the user to a malicious website, or execute malicious scripts within the Systran domain, leading to malware installation or other harmful actions.
- **Defacement:** The attacker can deface the user's view of the translated content and potentially inject any kind of content that could be misleading.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Translation Feature:** The attack vector is the "Web Translation" feature of the Systran software where a user submits a URL for translation.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires user interaction by requesting a translation of a URL controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to host a web page:** The attacker needs to host a web page containing malicious JavaScript code.
- **Knowledge of Systran platform:** The attacker needs to understand how the Systran web translation feature works and its vulnerability.
- **User Lure:** The attacker needs to persuade or trick the user into requesting the translation of the malicious URL.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**
- The attacker is able to exploit the vulnerability because the Systran server is acting as a proxy, and the user is not directly connecting to the attacker-controlled website, which might raise flags.
- The attack occurs when the user opens a second tab initiated by an initial translation request, and attempts to translate the same content from the second tab, which opens a third tab with the vulnerable content.
- The article also mentions that the Systran server was vulnerable to another issue (CVE-2020-29540) where an API key was being passed in a GET request and allowed for reflective denial of service attacks. This is not related to CVE-2020-29539.
