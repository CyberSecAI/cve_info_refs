          "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a user-controlled GET parameter `page` in an `include` statement without proper sanitization or restriction. Although the application appends '.php' to the filename, this can be bypassed using null byte injection in PHP versions before 5.3 or using php://filter meta-wrapper in PHP versions >= 5.3.",
          "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
            "Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability",
            "Lack of input sanitization",
            "Improper restriction on file inclusion using `include` statement"
          ],
          "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can include arbitrary files which could lead to code execution or arbitrary file disclosure, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or executing malicious code on the server.",
          "Attack vectors": [
            "HTTP GET request with a malicious `page` parameter",
            "Null byte injection (`%00`) before `.php` extension for PHP < 5.3",

          "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not require any authentication and can be any remote user able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint."

              "Root cause of vulnerability": "This document provides information about PHP's I/O streams, including `php://filter`, which can be used in Local File Inclusion (LFI) attacks. While not a root cause, it explains the mechanism used to exploit the vulnerability.",
              "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
                  "Use of php://filter meta-wrapper can be exploited to read the content of files by providing a base64 encode filter in the read chain."

             "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can potentially bypass security restrictions of LFI to read files if a vulnerable parameter is used inside an include statement.",

          "Root cause of vulnerability": "This document describes how include and require statements work in PHP, and how they can be used to include the content of one file into another. However it also highlights the difference between the two when it comes to errors, require stops execution upon failure, while include does not. This content provides a background understanding of how LFI vulnerabilities utilizing include statements can happen.",
          "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
            "Using include statement with untrusted input can lead to Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities."
