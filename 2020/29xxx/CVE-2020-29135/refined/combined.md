### cPanel TSR-2020-0007 Full Disclosure

November 17, 2020
### SEC-567

**Summary**

URL parameter injection vulnerabilities in multiple interfaces.

**Security Rating**

cPanel has assigned this vulnerability a CVSSv3.1 score of 2.6 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

**Description**

Many cPanel & WHM interfaces create URIs to other interfaces by incorporating user-supplied data in URI query parameters. Several cPanel & WHM interfaces were using URL encoding on these parameters rather than URI encoding. Due to this mistake, a cPanel & WHM user could be misled into performing actions they did not intend.

**Credits**

This issue was discovered by the cPanel Security Team.

**Solution**

This issue is resolved in the following builds:
11.92.0.2
11.90.0.17
11.86.0.32

### SEC-575

**Summary**

Two factor authentication vulnerable to brute force attack.

**Security Rating**

cPanel has assigned this vulnerability a CVSSv3.1 score of 4.3 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

**Description**

The two-factor authentication cPanel Security Policy did not prevent an attacker from repeatedly submitting two-factor authentication codes. This allowed an attacker to bypass the two-factor authentication check using brute force techniques. Failed validation of the two-factor authentication code is now treated as equivalent to a failure of the account’s primary password validation and rate limited by cPHulk.

**Credits**

This issue was discovered by Michael Clark and Wes Wright of Digital Defense, Inc.

**Solution**

This issue is resolved in the following builds:
11.92.0.2
11.90.0.17
11.86.0.32

### SEC-577

**Summary**

**Security Rating**

**Description**

Error messages in the WHM Transfer Tool Interface were not properly encoded. This allowed the injection of HTML into some error messages displayed for invalid inputs.

**Credits**

This issue was discovered by the cPanel Security Team.

**Solution**

This issue is resolved in the following builds:
11.92.0.2
11.90.0.17
