# Exploit Title: MiniWeb HTTP Server 0.8.19 - Buffer Overflow (PoC)
# Date: 13.12.2020
# Exploit Author: securityforeveryone.com
# Author Mail: hello[AT]securityforeveryone.com
# Vendor Homepage: https://sourceforge.net/projects/miniweb/
# Software Link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/miniweb/files/miniweb/0.8/miniweb-win32-20130309.zip/download
# Version: 0.8.19
# Tested on: Win7 x86
# Researchers: Security For Everyone Team - https://securityforeveryone.com

'''
Description

 MiniWeb HTTP server 0.8.19 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a long name for the
 first parameter in a POST request.

Exploitation

 The vulnerability is the first parameter's name of the POST request. Example: PARAM_NAME1=param_data1&param_name2=param_data2
 if we send a lot of "A" characters to "PARAM_NAME1", the miniweb server will crash.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# MiniWeb HTTP Server 0-day Vulnerability (CVE-2020-29596)

![SecurityForEveryone](https://s4e.io/favicon.ico)

S4E.io

22/Dec/20

![](https://static.s4e.io/web/public/img/documents/2020/miniweb/miniweb4.png)

## **MiniWeb HTTP Server 0-day Vulnerability (CVE-2020-29596)**

[MiniWeb](https://sourceforge.net/projects/miniweb/) is open-source software that often acts as a tiny HTTP server for small systems. The software was developed in C language and received the latest update in 2018.

As a result of our researches, we detected the buffer overflow vulnerability in the POST parameter sent to the MiniWeb server.

**How Did We Detect MiniWeb HTTP Server Buffer Overflow Vulnerability?**

As the Security For Everyone team, we regularly look for vulnerabilities in the software we have chosen to find 0-day. One of the software we chose was the MiniWeb HTTP server, which serves as an HTTP server. After deciding on the application that we will look for vulnerability, we performed the following steps in turn:

1. We used the [Boofuzz](https://github.com/jtpereyda/boofuzz) ??framework, an open-source project, to automate the vulnerability search process.
2. Our HTTP fuzz codes found a crash in the software.
3. When we examined the pcap file of the crash that was received, we determined that this crash was caused by sending a large number of characters instead of one of the parameters in the POST request sent to the server.
4. We verified the vulnerability by manually repeating the same case so that the finding is not a false positive.
5. We worked to transform the vulnerability into Remote Code Execution vulnerability, not as Denial of Service, but the vulnerability was not exploitable, so we published it as Denial of Service.

Finally, we applied to [Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html) and got our CVE code.

**What to Do?**

Although the software was last updated in 2018, we tried to contact the developer after detecting the vulnerability but did not deal with it. Since the software does not receive an update or patch anymore, Security For Everyone team recommends using a more stable HTTP server software that receives updates and patches instead of this software.
