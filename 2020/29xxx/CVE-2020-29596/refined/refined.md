### Vulnerability:
Buffer Overflow

### Root Cause:
The vulnerability is triggered by sending a large number of characters as the name of the first parameter in a POST request to the MiniWeb HTTP server. Specifically, the server crashes when the length of "PARAM_NAME1" in "PARAM_NAME1=param_data1&param_name2=param_data2" is excessively long.

### Impact:
Denial of Service (daemon crash). The researchers tried to transform the vulnerability into Remote Code Execution vulnerability, but the vulnerability was not exploitable, so they published it as Denial of Service.

### Attack Vector:
A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request with an overly long parameter name to the MiniWeb HTTP server.

### Required Capabilities:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target MiniWeb server. No authentication is required.

### Vulnerable Software:
MiniWeb HTTP Server version 0.8.19
