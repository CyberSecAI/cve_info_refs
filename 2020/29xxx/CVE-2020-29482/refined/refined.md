Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29482:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in `oxenstored`, the Xenstore daemon written in OCaml.
- It stems from an incorrect path length check when a guest interacts with Xenstore.
- Guests can access Xenstore paths using absolute or relative paths. Relative paths implicitly include `/local/domain/$DOMID` for the guest's domain ID.
- `oxenstored` enforces a path name limit, but this limit is applied only to the relative or absolute path specified by the client, not the full, resolved path.
- This allows a guest to create paths in its namespace that are too long for management tools to access when using absolute paths to access these paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Path Length Check:** The path length check in `oxenstored` is insufficient. It only considers the client-provided path, not the expanded absolute path that the tool would need to use.
- **Bypass of Intended Access Controls:** A guest can create path names which can't be accessed by management tools.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS) to Management Tools:** A malicious guest administrator can create excessively long paths, causing management tools (e.g., `xenstore-ls -r`) to fail when they try to access these paths using an absolute path.
- **Limited Impact on Host System:** While management tools may be impacted, the vulnerability does not allow a guest to prevent the host administrator from tearing down the domain. It should not affect other operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious guest administrator crafts excessively long path names within its own Xenstore namespace.
- This is done using the Xenstore interface from within the guest.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative control over a guest domain using the `oxenstored` daemon, which is the default if OCaml is available on the system.
- The attacker must be able to create xenstore nodes within the guest domain.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects systems using `oxenstored` but not those using the C-based version of `xenstored`.
- This vulnerability can be triggered by creating long relative path names from within the guest domain and is exposed when these are accessed by management tools from outside of the guest domain.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Edwin Török and analysed by Andrew Cooper, both of Citrix.
