Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the web server running on the CDATA OLT devices exposing sensitive information in clear text through specific CGI files, without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The web server exposes files containing sensitive data, including web and telnet credentials, and SNMP community strings, in clear text.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** Access to these sensitive files does not require any authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to web, telnet, and SNMP credentials, allowing them to fully control the device and potentially disrupt or monitor network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The web server is reachable from both the WAN interface and the FTTH LAN interface (from ONTs), making the attack vector accessible from both the internet and the internal network.
*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker can retrieve the sensitive information by sending HTTP GET requests to specific CGI files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable OLT device.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the location of the exposed CGI files and how to send a basic HTTP GET request.

**Technical Details:**
*   The following files are exposed through the web server:
    *   `/opt/lighttpd/web/cgi/snmp_read.txt`
    *   `/opt/lighttpd/web/cgi/snmp_write.txt`
    *   `/opt/lighttpd/web/cgi/web_login.txt`
    *   `/opt/lighttpd/web/cgi/web_passwd.txt`
    *   `/opt/lighttpd/web/cgi/onu_name.txt`
    *   `/opt/lighttpd/web/cgi/oem.txt`
*   The content of these files contain sensitive credentials and configuration settings in clear-text format.
