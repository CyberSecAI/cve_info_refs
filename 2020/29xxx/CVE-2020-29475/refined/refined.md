- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when updating schedule tasks. Specifically, the 'Name' parameter within the schedule task configuration is vulnerable to stored XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the schedule tasks' name field. Every time a user accesses the page displaying the schedule tasks, the injected script will execute. This allows the attacker to steal cookies or perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web interface of the nopCommerce application, specifically in the "System -> Schedule Tasks" section. The attacker crafts a malicious payload and injects it into the 'Name' field when editing a task.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative access to the nopCommerce application to modify schedule tasks.
