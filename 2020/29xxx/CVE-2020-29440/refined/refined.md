Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerabilities described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a combination of multiple security flaws in the Tesla Model X's keyless entry system, specifically within the key fob firmware update process and the vehicle's body control module (BCM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Lack of Code Signing for Key Fob Firmware Updates:** The key fobs receive over-the-air firmware updates via Bluetooth, but these updates are not cryptographically signed, meaning an attacker can rewrite the firmware without detection.
2.  **Vulnerable Bluetooth Wake-Up Mechanism:** The key fob's Bluetooth is only active briefly after a battery reset, but the car's BCM can also trigger the Bluetooth wake-up.
3.  **Predictable BCM Identification Code:** The BCM uses a code derived from the last five digits of the car's VIN to identify itself to the key fob. This VIN is usually visible on the car's dashboard, making it easy to obtain.
4.  **Missing Certificate Validation for Key Pairing:** When pairing a new key fob, the BCM does not check the unique cryptographic certificate embedded in the key fob, allowing an attacker to register a rogue key.
5. **Unsecured CAN Bus Access:**  The port under the dash provides access to the car's CAN bus, allowing an attacker to send commands to the BCM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Vehicle Theft:** An attacker can unlock, start, and drive away with a Tesla Model X within minutes.
*   **Key Fob Compromise:** The attacker gains control over the key fob through firmware modification.
*   **Spoofing BCM:** The attacker can use a bootleg BCM that the keyfob will communicate with as if it belongs to the target vehicle

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within approximately 15 feet of the victim's key fob to initiate the Bluetooth connection to the keyfob. The firmware update can be done from hundreds of feet away.
2.  **VIN Access:** The attacker must have visual access to the car's VIN to obtain the last 5 digits.
3.  **Physical Access:** The attacker needs brief physical access to the car's interior to connect a computer to the CAN bus.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand Bluetooth communication, firmware rewriting, and CAN bus protocols.
*   **Hardware:** The attacker requires a custom hardware kit including a Raspberry Pi minicomputer, a Model X BCM, a key fob, and a Bluetooth radio (costing around $300).
*   **Proximity to Target:** The attacker must be within close proximity to the target's key fob and vehicle.
*  **Access to VIN:** The attacker must have visual access to the target vehicle's VIN.

**Additional Details:**

*   The attack is carried out in two stages. First, the attacker rewrites the key fob firmware to extract the unlock code. Secondly, the attacker pairs a rogue key with the car to be able to drive off with it.
* The attacker has to create a spoofed BCM using the VIN of the target vehicle
*   The attack takes approximately 90 seconds to unlock the car, and another minute to pair the rogue key once inside.
*   The researcher, Lennert Wouters, notified Tesla of the vulnerabilities, and Tesla is reportedly releasing a software update to address the issue.
