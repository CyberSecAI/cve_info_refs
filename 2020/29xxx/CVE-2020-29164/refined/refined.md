{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "Root cause": "Lack of proper input sanitization and validation in multiple PHP scripts.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Arbitrary File Creation/Override",
        "Arbitrary File Read",
        "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
        "Broken Authentication",
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code, read sensitive files, modify system files, bypass authentication, and manipulate database entries.",
      "Attack vectors": [
          "Manipulating URL parameters to inject XSS payloads.",
          "Inserting malicious code through user signup forms leading to stored XSS.",
          "Crafting specific POST requests to create/overwrite files.",
          "Exploiting file inclusion vulnerabilities to read arbitrary files.",
          "Using file inclusion vulnerabilities for SSRF.",
          "Bypassing authentication checks to upload malicious files.",
          "Injecting SQL payloads via user-controlled parameters."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have network access to the PacsOne Server and be able to send HTTP requests. Some vulnerabilities require a valid user account or the ability to sign-up for a new account. Also, the attacker could leverage a combination of vulnerabilities to bypass authentication and escalate privileges."
