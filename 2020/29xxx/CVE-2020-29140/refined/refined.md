Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-29140:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper use of the `add_escape_custom()` function in `interface/reports/immunization_report.php`. This function, intended for escaping characters, does not enclose the escaped output in quotes, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The lack of proper quoting after escaping allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- Improper Input Sanitization: The use of `add_escape_custom()` is insufficient for preventing SQL injection in this context, as it only escapes special characters but does not prevent the injection of SQL commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. The provided example demonstrates how to obtain the database version by injecting a `version()` call.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP POST request to `interface/reports/immunization_report.php`. The vulnerable parameter is embedded within the `form_code[]` array in the POST data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator privileges.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the OpenEMR server.
