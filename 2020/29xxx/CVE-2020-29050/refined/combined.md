# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# [SphinxSearch 0.0.0.0:9306 (CVE-2019-14511)](https://blog.wirhabenstil.de/2019/08/19/sphinxsearch-0-0-0-09306-cve-2019-14511/ "SphinxSearch 0.0.0.0:9306 (CVE-2019-14511)")

**TL;DR:** SphinxSearch comes with a insecure default configuration that opens a listener on port 9306. No auth required. Connections using a mysql client are possible.

I recently stumbled upon SphinxSearch. A fast database that can do full-text search much faster than MySQL/MariaDB (at least in my scenario) and runs on lower ressources than Lucene, Solr or Elasticsearch (which also performed the worst in my scenario).

One thing I came accross while installing it was the default configuration. In the default configuration SphinxSearch has a listener on TCP port 9306 with no authentication. Actually authentication is not implemented in SphinxSearch as far as I know. This would make you think that this listener is at least limited to localhost? Nope. The default setup creates a listener on 0.0.0.0:9306 (reading all interfaces, any IP port 9306) and allows connections without credentials using the MySQL client.

This is a screenshot from the official documentation as of August 2019:

![](https://blog.wirhabenstil.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sphinx-docs-1024x576.png)

“Archive” screenshot

I have tried contacting the SphinxSearch team using the website form and via Skype since July, but no reply.

**How to fix it?**
Just go to your SphinxSearch configuration and edit the listen variable to include only localhost or put a (host) firewall like iptables in front of your installation.

Sample of a localhost listener configuration:

```
[..]
searchd
 {
         listen                  = localhost:9312
         listen                  = localhost:9306:mysql41
[..]
```

At the time of writing the Internet has 100+ exposed installations. Some of them might be on purpose or the data might not be a secret, but for some it might be an issue. I know at least one project for email archiving which uses SphinxSearch – [piler](http://www.mailpiler.org/wiki/current%3Ainstallation). Users should check it immediately.

This is an example of a SphinxSearch login using mysqlclient:

```

   Hi. Thanks for pointing this out. We’re making a fork of Sphinx Search – much better supported, with monthly releases, new features (replication, PQ indexes etc.) and so on.

   We’ve discussed it with the team and decided to update the defaults. Here’s the issue <https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch/issues/261>

   BTW in terms of security we have 2 more things:

   – SSL support for http (already on github, should be released in beta stage in few days)

   – another vulnerability fixed – CALL SNIPPETS() could let you read any file from the OS. <https://docs.manticoresearch.com/latest/singlehtml/index.html#snippets-file-prefix> fixes it. Together with the listens at 0.0.0.0 by default may be quite a breach in Sphinx.

   We’ll appreciate if you ping us in case you find anything else in Sphinx/Manticore. Follow us on <https://twitter.com/manticoresearch>, come to our <http://slack.manticoresearch.com>, <https://forum.manticoresearch.com> and post issues on <https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch/issues>

     Awesome, thanks a lot for the information! I didnt know about Manticoresearch, only Sphinx. I will give it a try!

     CALL SNIPPETS() sounds interesting and scary at the same time…

# Security Information

* [Keeping your Debian System secure](#keeping-secure)
* [Recent Advisories](#DSAS)
* [Sources of Security Information](#infos)

 Debian takes security very seriously. We handle all security problems brought to our attention and ensure that they are corrected within a reasonable timeframe.

Experience has shown that security through obscurity never works. Therefore, public disclosure allows for quicker and better solutions of security problems. In that respect, this page addresses Debian's status regarding various known security holes, which could potentially affect the Debian operating system.

The Debian project coordinates many security advisories with other free software vendors, and as a result, these advisories are published the same day a vulnerability is made public.
In order to receive the latest Debian security advisories, please subscribe to the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list.

Debian also participates in security standardization efforts:

* The [Debian Security Advisories](#DSAS) are [CVE-Compatible](cve-compatibility)
* Debian [publishes](oval/) its security information using the [Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)](https://github.com/CISecurity/OVALRepo)

## Keeping your Debian System secure

The packages [unattended-upgrades](https://packages.debian.org/stable/admin/unattended-upgrades) can be installed
to keep the computer current with the latest security (and other) updates automatically.
The [wiki entry](https://wiki.debian.org/UnattendedUpgrades) has
more detailed information how to manually set up unattended-upgrades.

For more information about security issues in Debian, please refer to our FAQ and our documentation:

 [Security FAQ](faq)  [Securing Debian](../doc/user-manuals#securing)

## Recent Advisories [RSS](dsa)

These are the recent Debian Security Advisories (DSA) posted to the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) list.

SphinxSearch in Sphinx Technologies Sphinx through 3.1.1 allows directory
traversal (in conjunction with CVE-2019-14511) because the mysql client can
be used for CALL SNIPPETS and load\_file operations on a full pathname
(e.g., a file in the /etc directory). NOTE: this is unrelated to CMUSphinx.
