            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-29566 / XSA-348
                               version 3

            undue recursion in x86 HVM context switch code

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When they require assistance from the device model, x86 HVM guests
must be temporarily de-scheduled.  The device model will signal Xen
when it has completed its operation, via an event channel, so that the
relevant vCPU is rescheduled.

If the device model were to signal Xen without having actually
completed the operation, the de-schedule / re-schedule cycle would
repeat.  If, in addition, Xen is resignalled very quickly, the
re-schedule may occur before the de-schedule was fully complete,
triggering a shortcut.  This potentially repeating process uses
ordinary recursive function calls, so could result a stack overflow.

IMPACT
======

A malicious or buggy stubdomain serving a HVM guest can cause Xen to
crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) to the entire host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions are vulnerable.

Only x86 systems are affected.  Arm systems are not affected.

Only x86 stubdomains serving HVM guests can exploit the vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV or PVH guests will avoid the vulnerability.

(Switching from a device model stub domain to a dom0 device model does
NOT mitigate this vulnerability.  Rather, it simply recategorises the
vulnerability to hostile management code, regarding it "as designed";
thus it merely reclassifies these issues as "not a bug".  The security
of a Xen system using stub domains is still better than with a qemu-dm
running as a dom0 process.  Users and vendors of stub qemu dm systems
should not change their configuration to use a dom0 qemu process.)

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Julien Grall of Amazon.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate (set of) attached patch(es) resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

Package        : xen
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-29479 CVE-2020-29480 CVE-2020-29481 CVE-2020-29482
                 CVE-2020-29483 CVE-2020-29484 CVE-2020-29485 CVE-2020-29486
                 CVE-2020-29566 CVE-2020-29570 CVE-2020-29571

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor:

Several security issues affecting Xenstore could result in cross
domain access (denial of service, information leaks or privilege
escalation) or denial of service against xenstored.

Additional vulnerabilities could result in guest-to-host denial of
service.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.11.4+57-g41a822c392-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

For the detailed security status of xen please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xen>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1905668#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-12-08 19:18:42 UTC  ``` In the Ocaml xenstored implementation, the internal representation of the tree has special cases for the root node, because this node has no parent.  Unfortunately, permissions were not checked for certain operations on the root node.  Unprivileged guests can get and modify permissions, list, and delete the root node.  Deleting the whole xenstore tree is a hostwide denial of service.  Depending on the circumstances, the vulnerability can also be leveraged into an ability to gain write access to any part of xenstore.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1905668#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-12-15 16:28:21 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/12/15/13>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1905668#c2)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-12-15 16:28:46 UTC  ``` Created xen tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1908002](show_bug.cgi?id=1908002 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-29479 xen: oxenstored: permissions not checked on root node (XSA-353) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1905668#c3)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-12-15 22:20:04 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.
