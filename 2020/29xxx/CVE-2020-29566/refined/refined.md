{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "When x86 HVM guests require assistance from the device model, they are temporarily de-scheduled. The device model signals Xen upon completion, triggering rescheduling. However, if the device model signals prematurely without completing the operation, a rapid de-schedule/re-schedule cycle occurs. If Xen is quickly resignalled, rescheduling might happen before the de-schedule is complete, leading to a shortcut. This recursive process can cause a stack overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Undue recursion due to premature signaling by the device model.",
      "Lack of proper synchronization during de-scheduling and rescheduling."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious or faulty stubdomain serving a HVM guest can crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire host.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious or buggy stubdomain serving a HVM guest triggers the vulnerability via event channels."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker requires a malicious or buggy stubdomain serving a HVM guest to send a premature signal to Xen."
    ],
	"affected_systems": "All Xen versions on x86 architecture are vulnerable. ARM systems are not affected. Only x86 stubdomains serving HVM guests can exploit the vulnerability."
