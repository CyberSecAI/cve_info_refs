Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-29054:

**Vulnerability:** Credentials infoleak and credentials in clear-text (telnet)

**Root Cause:** The device's CLI allows extraction of administrator credentials in clear text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Clear-text storage:** The administrator username and password for the web interface are stored in clear text, which can be revealed via the CLI.
*   **Information Leak:** The `show system infor` command in the CLI exposes sensitive information

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker with CLI access can obtain administrator credentials for the web interface.
*   With these credentials, an attacker can gain full control over the device's web interface, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker requires a working CLI access to exploit this vulnerability. This can be achieved using the backdoor access with telnet vulnerability (CVE-2020-29059, CVE-2020-29060, CVE-2020-29061, CVE-2020-29062)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have gained access to the device's command-line interface (CLI), for example through one of the telnet backdoors.
*   No special privileges within the CLI are needed.

**Technical Details:**
*  The `show system infor` command reveals the web interface administrator login name and password in cleartext, for example:
  ```
  epon# show system infor
  Web Server
    Version          : V1.2.0
    BuildTime        : 19-04-23
    Administrator    : LOGIN_CLEAR_TEXT
    Password         : PASSWORD_CLEAR_TEXT
  ```
