{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "In the Ocaml xenstored implementation, permissions were not checked for certain operations on the root node due to special handling of the root node which has no parent.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient permission checks"
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged guest can get, modify permissions, list, and delete the root node. Deleting the whole xenstore tree leads to a host-wide denial of service. Privilege escalation may be possible depending on other software in use.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A guest administrator can exploit this vulnerability."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An unprivileged guest administrator is required to exploit the vulnerability.",
     "additional_details": "With the default \"xl\" toolstack, a guest administrator can escalate their privilege to that of the host. Systems using C xenstored are not vulnerable."
