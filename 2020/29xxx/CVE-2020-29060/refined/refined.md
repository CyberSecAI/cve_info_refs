Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29060:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly references CVE-2020-29060 as part of a list of vulnerabilities discovered in CDATA OLTs. Specifically, it's listed under the "Backdoor Access with telnet" section.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the presence of hardcoded, undocumented credentials for the telnet service running on CDATA OLT devices. These credentials provide administrative CLI access.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Hardcoded Backdoor Accounts:** The devices contain multiple sets of hardcoded usernames and passwords, allowing unauthorized access to the CLI. These credentials include `suma123/panger123`, `debug/debug124`, `root/root126` and `guest/[empty]`.
- **Exposed Telnet Service:** The telnet service is enabled and accessible via both the WAN and FTTH LAN interfaces, increasing the attack surface.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Full Administrator Access:** Successful exploitation grants attackers complete administrative control over the OLT device's CLI.
- **Configuration Overwrite:** Attackers can completely overwrite the device configuration.
- **Firmware Overwrite:**  Attackers can overwrite the device's firmware, leading to potentially persistent compromise.
- **Network Manipulation:** Attackers can alter network settings, disrupt services, and potentially intercept or manipulate network traffic.
- **Further Exploitation:** CLI access may enable further exploitation of other vulnerabilities on the device.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the telnet service running on the device's WAN and FTTH LAN interfaces.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Connectivity:** An attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable OLT device, which can be either from the WAN or FTTH LAN interface.
- **Knowledge of Backdoor Credentials:** The attacker must know one of the hardcoded username/password combinations to gain initial access.

**Additional Notes:**

- The document provides a list of affected models, including those sold under various brands, suggesting a wide impact.
- Multiple sets of credentials exist, depending on firmware versions.
- The document emphasizes that some backdoors may be intentionally placed by the vendor.
- The content provides detailed steps and examples of how to exploit the vulnerability and shows the full admin access obtained.
