### [RCE Using Recaf: an Awesome Java Decompiler/Recompiler](https://burninatorsec.blogspot.com/2021/04/rce-using-recaf-awesome-java.html)

Recaf is super slick for reverse engineering and editing Java, I used it for arbitrary command injection (for RCE running as root!) last week (see previous post about the file handle lock).

Anyway, about Recaf... I love that it auto-guesses the Java version. I used both the decompiler and hex editor, both excellent. Check it out:

### [Hash Cracking with Rental AI GPUs](https://burninatorsec.blogspot.com/2021/04/hash-cracking-with-rental-ai-gpus.html)

I've been doing a lot with fast.ai lately and really enjoying it. The worst part about AI is how long it takes to train a model, realize you messed up, change it, then do it again. A fast machine makes all the difference.

So when this guy was looking to do some hashcracking, and would have otherwise needed to borrow a bunch of physical graphic cards, I thought it would be a great time to suggest trying AI rental GPUs to do it. I think the implementation turned out great, check out his blog for details:

<https://www.scrawledsecurityblog.com/2020/11/cracking-password-hashes-on-cheap-how.html>

Note: we couldn't really use fast.ai Gradient/paperspace, since those free tiers are public by default. Obviously that wouldn't be great security. So the article describes vast.ai (I know, I thought it was a typo at first!)

### [CVE-2021-3163 - Stored XSS Slab Quill JS](https://burninatorsec.blogspot.com/2021/04/cve-2021-3163-xss-slab-quill-js.html)

XSS in the WYSIWYG HTML editor by abusing the image tag.

For example, in the POST request when adding a comment, add this payload to the field with the comment text by using an interception proxy like BurpSuite:

<div><image src=validateNonExistantImage.png onloadstart=alert(1337)> hey girl hey </div>

Now the payload is stored on the page. When the next user visits, the XSS will execute.

**This is a good example of why client side validation does not stop attackers who routinely bypass validation by interacting with APIs and server side endpoints directly.**

https://github.com/quilljs/quill/issues/3273

I reported this to LinkedIn since they are using QuillJS, but they only have a private bug bounty program.

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3163

NOTE: Though the CVE is marked as "disputed", it is a very basic stored XSS has been easily reproducible. They seemed to accept this explanation and remediation note in issue #3558, but as of September 2022, the issue is still open and there doesn't seem to be a security patch in place, so it's still exploitable. As explained here, in order to fix it, there needs to be server side sanitation in addition to the client side validation that they're already using:

### [Bamboozle D 3 f en d e r Effortlessly (BDE) - File Lock on Shell Code](https://burninatorsec.blogspot.com/2021/04/bamboozle-d-3-f-en-d-e-r-effortlessly.html)

Still confirming this is working the way I intend it, updates and detailed POC to follow...

I
found RCE in a web application, and place a web shell file in a
publicly facing directory on the server. However, AV keeps deleting it,
so as part of my command injection, I spin up a process to put a file
handle on the shell. Even though defender is *detecting* it, it's not *deleting* it. (I know it's detecting it because I've also gained remote desktop access and can see the alerts.)

In the past I have focused mainly on detection evasion but deletion evasion is looking a lot easier right now.

UPDATE:
Well, turns out my webshell was a low-priv account, but the process I
was doing command injection through was running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM,
so woot! No wonder I can successfully lock the webshell file using a
process that starts on startup. This doesn't work for Meterpreter
payloads that spin off their own processes that then become detected. So
maybe it works, but it's limited.

Sidenote:

A bit about how difficult it was to figure out I was root when my RCE was Java arbitrary code execution...

The
webshell was written to C:\inetpub\wwwroot by my Java process. It
executed commands as a low privilege AppPool type IIS user. Running
whoami through the shell will tell you this

Asking
the Java Virtual Machine¬† was a little useless. Calling
System.getProperty("user.name") just returns the USERNAME environment
variable from (I believe) when the JVM was initiated. This gave me
PC-NAME$ where PC was the domain name of another user I got access
another way, i.e. PC-NAME\otheruser.

FINALLY I got the idea to run "cmd.exe /c whoami" *directly* through
the Java injection, write the results to a publicly served directory
and check out the results. NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM! Whew! At this point I
guess I don't need evasion, I could just turn off the AV!

### [SQL Injection & Manual Data Exfiltration (For When SQLMap Won't Work)](https://burninatorsec.blogspot.com/2021/06/sql-injection-manual-data-exfiltration.html)

**This is a new payload that I'm hoping to incorporate into SQLMap soon ([here's the feature request](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/issues/4863)).**

Assume a field is vulnerable to error-based SQL injection. SQLMap did a good job mapping out the column names and table names, but couldn't return any data rows. Through some trial and error, it becomes clear I can use a convert error and JOIN to display some data one record at a time (since multiple records will not display). Unfortunately, the WHERE and TOP clauses weren't working, so I had to find another way to integrate through the data rows, so I used [LEAD() and LAG()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/lead-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15). Hurray, I've got some varchar values coming through!

targetsite.com/vulnerablepage.do?badfield=select **LEAD(CoolKeys,0,0) OVER (ORDER BY CoolKeys DESC)** from CoolTableName join OtherTable on ArbitraryField=AnotherArbitraryField ...etc.

That was a good start...we get a conversion error on the value, so we get the value displayed, i.e.

Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 's3cretKey' to data type int

However, there was one thing I still needed. I really wanted to chain this with a privilege escalation vulnerability I'd found earlier, and if I could get all the GUID user IDs, including the administrators, then I could become a higher privileged user.

The problem was the SQL injection wasn't returning the GUIDs in my injected SELECT statement. It was a more generic SQL error, which isn't helpful. But I found I could use CONCAT to force the conversion error to show it!

targetsite.com/vulnerablepage.do?badfield=select **concat(LEAD(GUIDData,0,0) OVER (ORDER BY GUIDData DESC),'hey')** from CoolTableName join OtherTable on ArbitraryField=AnotherArbitraryField

Now the error will show: [GUID value]hey! Yay, I'm admin!

TL;DR:

1.) Use LEAD and LAG for situations where one row must be returned (and WHERE or TOP 1 etc. isn't working)

2.) Use CONCAT to force conversion errors to display uniqueidentifier-type data values through conversion errors

This all applies to bug bounty programs where SQLMap is not allowed, or if that kind of traffic gets you blocked too often.

### CVE-2020-29592 and CVE-2020-29593 - Orchard CMS Unrestricted File Upload and XSS

Note: This is fixed in Orchard 1.10, this post is about Orchard 1.8.1.0.

CVE-2929-29592 - Unrestricted File Upload via Media Folder and TinyMCE HTML Editor:

![https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68610637/101294502-afb75c00-37e5-11eb-8bc4-9745a66e15f5.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68610637/101294502-afb75c00-37e5-11eb-8bc4-9745a66e15f5.png)

Not allowed because these are the allowed file types:

![https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68610637/101294729-741d9180-37e7-11eb-84e8-fee3143f34b1.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68610637/101294729-741d9180-37e7-11eb-84e8-fee3143f34b1.png)
