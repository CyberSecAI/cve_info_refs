Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29567:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- When moving IRQs (Interrupt Requests) between CPUs to distribute load, IRQ vectors are dynamically allocated and de-allocated. The de-allocation is conditional and is checked for certain constraints.
- If these conditions aren't met during the initial check, the CPU sends a self-interrupt, expecting that the IRQ will be delivered after the condition preventing cleanup is cleared.
- For two specific IRQ vectors, this expectation was violated, leading to a continuous stream of self-interrupts and rendering the CPU unusable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect handling of IRQ vector de-allocation when specific conditions are not met.
- Faulty assumption about the timing of interrupt delivery after a self-interrupt is triggered by the cleanup logic.
- Lack of proper validation of conditions before triggering a self-interrupt related to cleanup.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A domain with a passed through PCI device can cause a physical CPU to lock up.
- This results in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition for the entire host system. The affected CPU becomes effectively unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A guest with a physical PCI device passed through to it can exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker (guest) causes the conditions necessary to trigger the infinite loop during IRQ vector cleanup.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a guest virtual machine with a physical PCI device passed through to it.
- The attacker needs the ability to influence IRQ vector allocation and de-allocation. This can be achieved by triggering the necessary operations on the passed-through PCI device.

**Additional Notes:**
- Only Xen 4.14 is affected, versions 4.13 and earlier are not vulnerable.
- The vulnerability only affects x86 systems and not Arm systems.
- The vulnerability is related to dynamic allocation and de-allocation of IRQ vectors while moving IRQs between CPUs.
