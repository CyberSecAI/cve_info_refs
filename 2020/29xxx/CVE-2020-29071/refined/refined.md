Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-29071:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper handling of user-uploaded HTML files when accessed directly via a generated URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize or escape HTML content when accessed directly via URL, which allows the execution of arbitrary javascript code. The application attempts to mitigate this risk by displaying files in an iframe with the "sandbox" attribute when viewed via the UI. However, bypassing the iframe and accessing the file directly renders the file inline, in the context of the web application's origin allowing the execution of malicious javascript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution as root:** By crafting a malicious HTML file, uploading it, and then crafting another HTML file, and then tricking a user with "Sysadmin" privileges into accessing the file and running the javascript code, an attacker can achieve code execution on the server as the root user. This is achieved by exploiting the "Access Control" settings, which allows users to configure "Allowed Hosts". By injecting specially crafted input that leverages the TCP Wrappers to execute arbitrary commands as root, an attacker can gain complete control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **File upload and direct URL access:** An attacker uploads a malicious HTML file using the "Shares" feature. Then the attacker needs to craft a second malicious file containing the javascript payload and trick a privileged user into accessing that file directly via a crafted URL.
- **Social engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a privileged user into visiting the crafted malicious HTML file through a link they provide.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to upload files to the LiquidFiles server, for example by creating a user account or using an existing one if available.
- The attacker needs a privileged user, such as a "Sysadmin" user, to visit the malicious link.
