## What Do People Say About LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress

* ### A Really Cache Master

  I have tried almost all the cache and CDN plugins but LiteSpeed, besides being pre-integrated in the server, is a very complete tool, I recommend it, and with Cloudflare’s cache it goes very well!
  Recommended!

  —
  [Avakian](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-really-cache-master/)
* ### I Can’t Say Enough Good Things About LiteSpeed Cache.

  I can’t say enough good things about LiteSpeed Cache. From the first day I implemented it on our company’s WordPress site, the improvements were visible. Not only did our site’s loading speed increase dramatically, but our SEO rankings also saw a noticeable boost. It’s incredibly user-friendly and integrates seamlessly with other plugins. I highly recommend this to any business looking to enhance their website performance.

  —
  [supermarioai](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/i-cant-say-enough-good-things-about-litespeed-cache/)
* ### Very Fast and Reliable for Some Websites & Themes

  If Litespeed is compatible with your website, plugins and theme combination, this caching plugin (with your server environment running Litespeed) is very fast and reliable. After tweaking the settings, of which there is a comprehensive set of options, our website used to be 2.5Mb in size and a load time of around 1.5s which was reduced to 800Kb and an average load time of 275ms testing on tools.pingdom.com. We have tried numerous other good caching plugins, but Litespeed and Litespeed Server blow most others away. If you are hosting a high-traffic website, this saving on server overhead and response times has been a worthwhile investment.

  —
  [submeduk](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/very-fast-and-reliable-for-some-websites-themes/)
* ### Amazing and Free

  Thank You for Using the LiteSpeed Cache Plugin! Page Load Time: Before 1.26s, After 0.62s. Improved by 51%. PageSpeed Score: Before 83, After 99. Improved by 16%.

  —
  [starmhsn](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/amazing-and-free-9/)
* ### Experience Lightning-Fast Websites with LiteSpeed Cache

  I recently had the opportunity to integrate the LiteSpeed Cache plugin into my WordPress site, and I am thoroughly impressed with the results. The improvement in my website’s loading speed was nothing short of dramatic. As a Japanese user, I particularly appreciate the plugin’s accurate handling of Japanese characters, which makes it incredibly user-friendly for those of us in Japan. Additionally, the compatibility with my server is excellent, ensuring smooth operation without any hitches. If you’re looking for a reliable and efficient way to boost your website’s performance, LiteSpeed Cache is definitely worth considering.

  —
  [Po Nang](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/experience-lightning-fast-websites-with-litespeed-cache/)
* ### Advanced Preset Feature = A Game Changer

  Our hosting is on a LiteSpeed server. I initially tried the plugin and it broke the site so I moved and used several other caching plugins. While addressing resource issues and gave LiteSpeed Cache plugin another try. I discovered the Presets feature. Selected “ADVANCED”. Like magic, the PageSpeed scores for mobile went from 50s to 89.
  For both ease of use and spectacular results, this is the absolute best caching plugin of the five others I’ve tried.

  —
  [tlemanski](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/advanced-preset-feature-a-game-changer/)
* ### Top-Notch Cache Plugin!

  I’ve been using this plugin on several websites, and I’m genuinely impressed with the results. It’s undoubtedly one of the best cache plugins I’ve come across. LiteSpeed Cache is an all-in-one solution that has greatly improved the performance of my websites. I absolutely love this plugin!

  —
  [Ashim Kumar](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/top-notch-cache-plugin/)
* ### Perhaps The Best Caching plugin

  There are plenty of caching plugins on the market. But this one does a fantastic job when you are running a wp site on a Litespeed based Server. There’s no better alternative.
  Here are a few features I love about this free plugin
  Integration of free CDN with QuicCloud CDN
  Caching and clear caching features. Selective clear cache feature
  Object caching
  Redis integration / Memcache integration
  External CDN integration
  Out of the box, templates of caching settings to use
  Select / Deselect if you want to combine JS and HTML and CSS or keep them seperate
  Debugging: Disable all features temporarily if testing or updating something
  Easiest to use and setup. With Litespeed Server + Quic CDN and a well developed website, it makes it super easy to reach 100% speed test results
  Integration with Quic means you can create HTML based front end that’s stored on CDN servers and serves the user super fast html pages.

  —
  [Mustafa](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/perhaps-the-best-caching-plugin/)
* ### Drastic Difference in Site Speed

  My site was running REALLY slowly, it was driving me crazy. Tried everything I could think of, including all the ‘best’ plugins’ on offer
  No plugin I’ve tried prior has made as drastic an improvement compared to Litespeed. I’m absolutely delighted with it.
  Fantastic plugin, that actually does what it claims to do.

  —
  [jesseq](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/drastic-difference-in-site-speed/)
* ### Perfectly

  I am a layman for these things and I managed to greatly accelerate my website. There are enough guides and instructions available so that it goes fine. My first setting to PageSpeed Insights for mobile phone is 95-78-100-92 and 99-77-100-91 for pc. I recommend. I use a Divi Extra theme.

  —
  [ekofan](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/perfectly-38/)
* ### Love This Plugin!

  I’ve been using LSC for quite a while and the speed of my site now is wonderful! I recently had an issue with a conflict on my site and the support team helped me resolve it very quickly. Great product and excellent support!

  —
  [Shirley Alarie](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/love-this-plugin-1237/)
* ### Best by Test

  Install, connect to quick.cloud and configure DNS/CDN, and my page boost from 39 to 92 PageSpeed without special LiteSpeed-server-host. You will not get any caching plugin that serves that for 0$ at that time and will pay later by quota and use – faire enough! Besides you get DDoS Protection etc. for free. I feel the guys are really interested to secure PageSpeed and “caching product” not only serving a “cashing product”!!
  Thanks

  —
  [ingovogelsang](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/best-by-test/)
* ### Best Speed Optimization Plugin Ever

  Best speed optimization plugin ever. I have been paying for freelancers to speed up my wsebsite. That just ended with Litespeed Cache. Thank you.

  —
  [psiworks](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/best-speed-optimization-plugin-ever-2/)
* ### Maravilloso

  Con las todas las funciones gratuitas que tiene, es más que suficiente si tu web no es de gran escala. Ha mejorado la mía de manera exponencial (al menos en web de escritorio). Un 5/5. *With all the free functions it has, it is more than enough if your website is not large scale. It has improved mine exponentially (at least on the desktop web). A 5/5.*

  —
  [borta37](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/maravilloso-45/)
* ### Muy Buena Paso Mi Web De 55 a 90% en Rendimiento

  Muchas gracias a mejorado mi rendimiento, mi accesibilidad y seo automáticamente, ahora mi sitio tiene muy buenos puntajes en páginas como Pagespeed de Google, 100% recomendado. *Thank you very much for automatically improving my performance, accessibility and SEO, now my site has very good scores on pages like Google Pagespeed, 100% recommended.*

  —
  [pxndres](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/muy-buena-paso-mi-web-de-55-a-90-en-rendimiento/)
* ### For Our Server Clients, It’s The Go To

  Fast, powerful and designed by the LiteSpeed folk to work with their own software.

  —
  [gerard70](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/for-our-server-clients-its-the-go-to/)
* ### Super Awesome

  Super Awesome! Saves me three plugins – cache, CloudFlare, image opt – and does a superior job in each case.

  —
  [aCstudent](https://profiles.wordpress.org/acstudent)
* ### Works Well, Good Documentation, and Fantastic Support Responses

  First, the plugin works great and it’s easy to verify that with the various page speed tools. What impresses me most though is the excellent support responses, both for caching newbies and experts who just need the setup details.

  —
  [icepicksu](https://profiles.wordpress.org/icepicksu)
* ### Powerful

  I am running this on many sites and it does a splendid job all around to compress and cache.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Is the LiteSpeed Cache Plugin for
WordPress free?

Yes, this LSCache plugin will always be free and open source. That said, a LiteSpeed server is required, and there are fees associated with some LiteSpeed server editions. Additionally, some of the premium online services provided through QUIC.cloud (CDN Service, Image Optimization, Critical CSS, Unique CSS, Low-Quality Image Placeholder, etc.) require payment at certain usage levels.

What server software is required for
this plugin?

A LiteSpeed server is required in order to use this plugin. You will need one of the following (any single server or cluster including one of these will work):

1. LiteSpeed Web Server Enterprise with LSCache Module (v5.0.10+)
2. OpenLiteSpeed (v1.4.17+)
3. QUIC.cloud CDN

Many of the optimization features may be used with any web server. A LiteSpeed server is not required for such features.

What is the difference between the
LSCache Module for LSWS (requires a license) and the LSCache Plugin for WordPress (free)?

The LSCache Module is built into your licensed copy of LiteSpeed Web Server. When it comes to caching
dynamic content, the LSCache Module does all of the work.

The LSCache Plugin for WordPress is simply an interface. It allows WordPress to instruct the server
Module on what to cache, how long to cache it, and when to purge. And it allows the site owner to manage
and configure the Module. Without the Module, the Plugin could not function.

A licensed LSCache Module is required in order to use the free LSCache Plugin.

Does this plugin work in a clustered
environment?

The cache entries are stored at the LiteSpeed server level. The simplest solution is to use LiteSpeed
WebADC, as the cache entries will be stored at that level.

If using another load balancer, the cache entries will only be stored at the backend nodes, not at the
load balancer.

The purges will also not be synchronized across the nodes, so this is not recommended.

If a customized solution is required, please contact LiteSpeed Technologies at
This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.

NOTICE: The rewrite rules created by this plugin must be copied to the Load Balancer.

Does LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress work
with OpenLiteSpeed?

Yes it can work well with OpenLiteSpeed, although some features (such as ESI) may not be supported. Any
setting changes that require modifying the .htaccess file will require a server restart.

Is WooCommerce supported?

In short, yes. However, for some woocommerce themes, the cart may not be updated correctly. Please see
this
[blog post](https://blog.litespeedtech.com/2017/05/31/wpw-fixing-lscachewoocommerce-conflicts/ "https://blog.litespeedtech.com/2017/05/31/wpw-fixing-lscachewoocommerce-conflicts/")
for a quick tutorial on how to detect this problem and fix it if necessary.

Are my images optimized?

Images are not optimized automatically, but if you'd like to have it done we provide an
[Image-Optimization](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/imageopt/ "litespeed_wiki:cache:lscwp:image-optimization")
function. Find it at LiteSpeed Cache > Image Optimization.

Does LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress have
a crawler?

Yes. The crawler must be enabled by your hosting provider. Once enabled, the crawler can be configured to
traverse your site on a regular basis, and re-cache any pages that have expired from cache. Visitors are
far less likely to encounter uncached content on a well-crawled site. Pages load fast and deliver a
positive user experience.

How to Install LiteSpeed Cache for
WordPress?

LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress works right out of the box with default settings that are appropriate for
most sites. Please refer to the steps from our
[How to Install LSCWP](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/installation/ "How to Install LSCWP")
page.

How can I check if LiteSpeed Cache is enabled?

Try our [LSCache Check tool](https://check.lscache.io/ "How to Install LSCWP"), which detects LiteSpeed Cache support as well as QUIC.cloud CDN support for any URL.

### Third Party Compatibility

The vast majority of plugins and themes are compatible with LSCache. [Our API](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/api/) is available for those that are not. Use the API to customize smart purging, customize cache rules, create cache varies, and make WP nonce cacheable, among other things.

### Privacy

This plugin includes some suggested text that you can add to your site’s Privacy Policy via the Guide in the WordPress Privacy settings.

**For your own information:** LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress potentially stores a duplicate copy of every web page on display on your site. The pages are stored locally on the system where LiteSpeed server software is installed and are not transferred to or accessed by LiteSpeed employees in any way, except as necessary in providing routine technical support if you request it. All cache files are temporary, and may easily be purged before their natural expiration, if necessary, via a Purge All command. It is up to individual site administrators to come up with their own cache expiration rules.

In addition to caching, our WordPress plugin has online features provided by QUIC.cloud for Image Optimization, CSS Optimization and Low Quality Image Placeholder services. When one of those optimizations are requested, data is transmitted to a remote QUIC.cloud server, processed, and then transmitted back for use on your site. Now if using the QUIC.cloud CDN it uses LSCache technologies to access your site then host your site to others globally and also your data is not transferred to or accessed by QUIC.cloud employees in any way, except as necessary in providing maintenance or technical support. QUIC.cloud keeps copies of that data for up to 7 days and then permanently deletes them. Similarly, the WordPress plugin has a Reporting feature whereby a site owner can transmit an environment report to LiteSpeed so that we may better provide technical support. None of these features collects any visitor data. Only server and site data are involved.

Please see the [QUIC.cloud Privacy Policy](https://quic.cloud/privacy-policy/) for our complete Privacy/GDPR statement.

  Cache Hit Example

## Installation

[View detailed documentation](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/installation/).

#### For Optimization Without a LiteSpeed Web Server

1. Install the LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress plugin and activate it.
2. From the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache > Page Optimization**. Enable the available optimization features in the various tabs.

#### For Caching and Optimization With a LiteSpeed Web Server

1. Install [LiteSpeed Web Server Enterprise](https://www.litespeedtech.com/products/litespeed-web-server) with LSCache Module, [LiteSpeed Web ADC](https://www.litespeedtech.com/products/litespeed-web-adc), or [OpenLiteSpeed](https://www.litespeedtech.com/open-source/openlitespeed) with cache module (Free). Or sign up for [QUIC.cloud CDN](https://quic.cloud).
2. Install the LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress plugin and activate it.
3. From the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache > Cache**, make sure the option **Enable LiteSpeed Cache** is set to `ON`.
4. Enable any desired caching and optimization features in the various tabs.

#### Notes for LiteSpeed Web Server Enterprise

* Make sure that your license includes the LSCache module. A [2-CPU trial license with LSCache module](https://www.litespeedtech.com/products/litespeed-web-server/download/get-a-trial-license "trial license") is available for free for 15 days.
* The server must be configured to have caching enabled. If you are the server admin, [click here](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/start/#configure-cache-root-and-cache-policy) for instructions. Otherwise, please request that the server admin configure the cache root for the server.

#### Notes for OpenLiteSpeed

* This integration utilizes OpenLiteSpeed’s cache module.
* If it is a fresh OLS installation, the easiest way to integrate is to use [ols1clk](https://openlitespeed.org/kb/1-click-install/). If using an existing WordPress installation, use the `--wordpresspath` parameter.
* If OLS and WordPress are both already installed, please follow the instructions in [How To Set Up LSCache For WordPress](https://openlitespeed.org/kb/how-to-setup-lscache-for-wordpress/).

## FAQ

### Why do the cache features require LiteSpeed Server?

This plugin communicates with your LiteSpeed Web Server and its built-in page cache (LSCache) to deliver superior performance to your WordPress site. The plugin’s cache features indicate to the server that a page is cacheable and for how long, or they invalidate particular cached pages using tags.

LSCache is a server-level cache, so it’s faster than PHP-level caches. [Compare with other PHP-based caches](https://www.litespeedtech.com/benchmarks/wordpress).

A page cache allows the server to bypass PHP and database queries altogether. LSCache, in particular, because of its close relationship with the server, can remember things about the cache entries that other plugins cannot, and it can analyze dependencies. It can utilize tags to manage the smart purging of the cache, and it can use vary cookies to serve multiple versions of cached content based on things like mobile vs. desktop, geographic location, and currencies. [See our Caching 101 blog series](https://blog.litespeedtech.com/tag/caching-101/).

If all of that sounds complicated, no need to worry. LSCWP works right out of the box with default settings that are appropriate for most sites. [See the Beginner’s Guide](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/beginner/).

**Don’t have a LiteSpeed server?** Try our QUIC.cloud CDN service. It allows sites on *any server* (NGINX and Apache included) to experience the power of LiteSpeed caching! [Click here](https://quic.cloud) to learn more or to give QUIC.cloud a try.

### What about the optimization features of LSCache?

LSCWP includes additional optimization features, such as Database Optimization, Minification and Combination of CSS and JS files, HTTP/2 Push, CDN Support, Browser Cache, Object Cache, Lazy Load for Images, and Image Optimization! These features do not require the use of a LiteSpeed web server.

### Is the LiteSpeed Cache Plugin for WordPress free?

Yes, LSCWP will always be free and open source. That said, a LiteSpeed server is required for the cache features, and there are fees associated with some LiteSpeed server editions. Some of the premium online services provided through QUIC.cloud (CDN Service, Image Optimization, Critical CSS, Low-Quality Image Placeholder, etc.) require payment at certain usage levels. You can learn more about what these services cost, and what levels of service are free, on [your QUIC.cloud dashboard](https://my.quic.cloud).

### What server software is required for this plugin?

A LiteSpeed solution is required in order to use the **LiteSpeed Exclusive** features of this plugin. Any one of the following will work:

1. LiteSpeed Web Server Enterprise with LSCache Module (v5.0.10+)
2. OpenLiteSpeed (v1.4.17+)
3. LiteSpeed WebADC (v2.0+)
4. QUIC.cloud CDN

The **General Features** may be used with *any* web server. LiteSpeed is not required.

### Does this plugin work in a clustered environment?

The cache entries are stored at the LiteSpeed server level. The simplest solution is to use LiteSpeed WebADC, as the cache entries will be stored at that level.

If using another load balancer, the cache entries will only be stored at the backend nodes, not at the load balancer.

The purges will also not be synchronized across the nodes, so this is not recommended.

If a customized solution is required, please contact LiteSpeed Technologies at `info@litespeedtech.com`

NOTICE: The rewrite rules created by this plugin must be copied to the Load Balancer.

### Where are the cached files stored?

The actual cached pages are stored and managed by LiteSpeed Servers.

Nothing is stored within the WordPress file structure.

### Does LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress work with OpenLiteSpeed?

Yes it can work well with OpenLiteSpeed, although some features may not be supported. See **Plugin Features** above for details. Any setting changes that require modifying the `.htaccess` file will require a server restart.

### Is WooCommerce supported?

In short, yes. However, for some WooCommerce themes, the cart may not be updated correctly. Please [visit our blog](https://blog.litespeedtech.com/2017/05/31/wpw-fixing-lscachewoocommerce-conflicts/) for a quick tutorial on how to detect this problem and fix it if necessary.

### Are my images optimized?

Images are not optimized automatically unless you set **LiteSpeed Cache > Image Optimization > Image Optimization Settings > Auto Request Cron** to `ON`. You may also optimize your images manually. [Learn more](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/imageopt/).

### How do I make a WP nonce cacheable in my third-party plugin?

Our API includes a function that uses ESI to “punch a hole” in a cached page for a nonce. This allows the nonce to be cached separately, regardless of the TTL of the page it is on. Learn more in [the API documentation](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/api/#esi). We also welcome contributions to our predefined list of known third party plugin nonces that users can optionally include via [the plugin’s ESI settings](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/cache/#esi-nonce).

### How do I enable the crawler?

The crawler is disabled by default, and must be enabled by the server admin first.

Once the crawler is enabled on the server side, navigate to **LiteSpeed Cache > Crawler > General Settings** and set **Crawler** to `ON`.

For more detailed information about crawler setup, please see [the Crawler documentation](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/lscache/lscwp/crawler/).
