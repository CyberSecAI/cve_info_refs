Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29600:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient path validation in the `awstats.pl` script. When a configuration file is not found at the default location (`/etc/awstats/awstats.conf`), the script attempts to load a configuration file specified via the `config` parameter in the URL.  It uses `File::Spec->rel2abs` to attempt to sanitize the path, but fails to prevent path traversal when an absolute path is provided, or when a partial absolute path omitting the initial `/etc` is provided.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. The `awstats.pl` script improperly handles user-supplied input via the `config` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary files on the server's filesystem to be parsed as configuration files. This can be done by using an absolute file path or a partial absolute path.
*   **Incomplete Fix:** The vulnerability is a result of an incomplete fix for a previous similar vulnerability (CVE-2017-1000501). The previous fix did not fully address the issue when the default `/etc/awstats/awstats.conf` file was missing.
*   **Configuration Parsing:** The script attempts to parse the specified file as a configuration file, leading to errors but revealing potentially sensitive information about the file's content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could read the content of arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly mentioned as a primary vector, the Debian LTS advisory notes that this vulnerability could be leveraged for arbitrary code execution. This likely means that if an attacker could provide a crafted file that, when parsed, could execute code, it might be possible, but is not the primary impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `awstats.pl` with a manipulated `config` parameter. For example:
    `http://<server>/cgi-bin/awstats.pl?config=/etc/passwd`
    `http://<server>/cgi-bin/awstats.pl?config=../some/other/file`
    `http://<server>/cgi-bin/awstats.pl?config=passwd`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `awstats.pl` script.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication.
*   **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker may need to have some knowledge of the file system structure to exploit the path traversal issue effectively.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The issue is triggered if the default `/etc/awstats/awstats.conf` is not present. The Debian package installs the default config so it is not vulnerable by default. However, if the configuration is removed, the application becomes vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `awstats` version `7.8-1`.
