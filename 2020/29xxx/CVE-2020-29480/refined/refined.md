{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The xenstore implementation lacks permission checks when reporting a xenstore watch event. This allows a guest administrator to watch the root xenstored node and receive notifications for every created, modified, and deleted key.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing permission checks on xenstore watch notifications",
      "Unrestricted access to watch events"
    ],
    "impact": "A guest administrator can observe non-sensitive domain and device lifecycle events relating to other guests. This includes information about other VMs, driver domains, virtual interfaces, block devices, vCPUs, virtual framebuffers, Xen VM UUIDs, and timing information. This information can be commercially interesting or make other attacks easier. However, there is no exposure of sensitive data like VNC passwords, port numbers, file system paths, or cryptographic keys.",
    "attack_vectors": "A guest administrator can exploit the lack of permission checks by setting up watches on the root xenstored node or by using special watches.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a guest administrator within a Xen virtualized environment."
