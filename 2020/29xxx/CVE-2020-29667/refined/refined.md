  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of a hardcoded, predefined cookie value and insufficient session expiration in the Lan ATMService M3 ATM Monitoring System.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Insufficient Session Expiration: The system does not properly manage session lifetimes, allowing sessions to remain active longer than intended.",
        "Predefined Cookie Value: The system uses a default, hardcoded cookie value (PHPSESSID=LANIT-IMANAGER), making it predictable and exploitable."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can gain control over the ATM monitoring system, potentially allowing them to operate and manipulate the state of remote ATM machines. This can lead to a high loss of availability of the ATMs and low loss of integrity",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "Remote access: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.",
        "Predefined cookie usage: By using the hardcoded cookie value, an attacker can bypass normal authentication mechanisms."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a crafted cookie header, which is a standard web request manipulation technique."
