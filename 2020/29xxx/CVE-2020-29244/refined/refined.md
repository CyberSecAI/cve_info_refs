The provided content is related to CVE-2020-29244.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `readTextWithDescrFrame` function within the `id3v2frames.go` file of the `dhowden/tag` library.
- The function does not properly check the size of the input byte slice `b`. Specifically, it attempts to access `b[2]` and `b[3]` without validating if the slice has at least 4 elements, which leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** When the size of the input byte slice `b` is less than 4 (specifically when it's 2 or less), the code tries to access `b[2]` and `b[3]`, resulting in a slice bounds out of range error. This is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The panic caused by the out-of-bounds read leads to a program crash, resulting in a denial of service. Specifically, the program will panic when attempting to parse crafted ID3 tags that trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious crafted ID3 tags:** Attackers can craft malicious ID3 tags that, when parsed by the vulnerable `dhowden/tag` library, will trigger the out-of-bounds read in the `readTextWithDescrFrame` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted audio file with a malformed ID3 tag which will then be parsed by the vulnerable library. This implies that the attacker would need to control the input to the vulnerable application.
