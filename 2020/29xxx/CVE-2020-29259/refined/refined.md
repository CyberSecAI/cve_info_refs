The provided content details a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Online Examination System version 1.0.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the feedback form. Specifically, the "subject" and "feedback" parameters are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent XSS:** Malicious scripts injected into the feedback form are stored in the system and executed when an admin views the feedback.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the "subject" and "feedback" parameters of the feedback form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** An attacker can potentially gain full control of an admin account by stealing the admin's session cookie or redirecting them to an attacker-controlled domain.
- **Malicious Actions:** Once an attacker compromises the admin account, they can potentially perform malicious actions such as modifying data, creating new admin accounts, deleting content, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Feedback Submission:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an unauthenticated user through the feedback form on the homepage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to access the application's feedback form:** An attacker only needs to access the feedback form on the application's homepage to inject the malicious script.
- **No authentication is needed to submit feedback:** The attacker does not need an account or any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- Malicious payload `<script>alert(1)</script>` is injected into the "feedback" and "subject" parameters through a POST request to `/OnlineExaminationSystem/feed.php?q=feedback.php`.
- The injected payload is stored in the system, and when an admin views feedback by clicking on a link like `dash.php?q=3&fid=5fb9cc5991b31`, the injected script is executed within the admin's browser session.
- The provided POST request includes the following vulnerable parameters:
   - `name=xxx`
   - `subject=testing<script>alert(0)</script>`
   - `email=bcb@gmail.om`
   - `feedback=<script>alert(3)</script>`
   - `submit=Submit`
