##### Summary by ExpressVPN

A publicly known bug in the Nginx server used by the ExpressVPN Router version 1.x firmware was reported. ExpressVPN no longer ships or supports that version and all users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of the ExpressVPN Router firmware available on our site, which is not vulnerable to this bug. Additionally, we highly discourage our users from exposing their router control panel to the Internet, as this class of bug would only be exploitable with access to the control panel, which is usually restricted to the local network.

For help or support upgrading your router please visit: <https://www.expressvpn.com/support/>

##### Summary by ja1sh

## What is a VPN?

A **VPN**, or **virtual private network**, is a secure tunnel between your device and the internet. VPNs protect you from snooping, interference, and censorship.

 As you connect to a secure VPN server, your internet traffic goes through an encrypted tunnel that nobody can see intoâincluding hackers, governments, and your internet service provider.

## Benefits and advantages of VPN

![Laptop screens demonstrating the before and after process of changing a user's IP address.](https://xv.imgix.net/photos/xv/Change_your_location-19581a6ef9c7290333423ed0ee97e3d4.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&fit=max&q=60&w=320&s=c6cd457fe108c374ecc604998cb69fd3)

### Change your location

Using a VPN **changes your IP address**, the unique number that identifies you and where you are in the world. A new IP address makes it harder to determine your identity and real location. With ExpressVPN, you can appear to be in the UK, U.S., Canada, Australia, or any of [105 countries](/vpn-server).

![Download VPN provided the best-in-class 256-bit encryption.](https://xv.imgix.net/photos/xv/encryption-2fc801604da35f1879fc2f4d5da4443b.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&fit=max&q=60&w=320&s=bbd79bed04dd6a68062ba328d4e1b8f8)

### Protect your privacy

Changing your IP address with a VPN helps **shield your identity** from websites, apps, and services that want to track you. Good VPNs also prevent your internet provider, mobile carrier, and anyone else who may be listening from seeing your activity, thanks to a layer of strong encryption.

![Router VPN that covers all devices.](https://xv.imgix.net/photos/xv/vpn-router-connect-more-devices-1ce009403a96a923bbf96979cdfa78c7.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&fit=max&q=60&w=320&s=f749263a7c6d3aa0b6b974b24a6cd290)

### Increase your security

Using a VPN **protects you from security breaches** in many forms, including packet sniffing, rogue Wi-Fi networks, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Travelers, remote workers, and all kinds of on-the-go individuals use a VPN whenever theyâre on an untrusted network like free public Wi-Fi.

[Try ExpressVPN Risk-Free](/order)

## When should I use a VPN?

If privacy is important to you, you should use a VPN **every time you connect to the internet**. A VPN app runs in the background of your device so it wonât get in the way while you use other apps and browse the internet. And youâll have peace of mind knowing your privacy is always protected.

But here are some situations in which a VPN is especially useful:

###

![Airplane flying over the world.](https://xv.imgix.net/photos/xv/travel-globe-fdd6b0c4125636e5b2746fb1923f034e.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&fit=max&w=440&q=60&s=f238c84e9838b88329da0f9d47071e39)
##### While traveling

Exploring the world doesnât mean you have to change the way you use the internet. A VPN lets you use the internet as if you were still in your home country, no matter how far you travel.

![Enjoy the content you want: streaming TV and music on a laptop.](https://xv.imgix.net/photos/xv/what-is-vpn-streaming-32683d4913c72a969698f36c5be17ae0.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&fit=max&w=440&q=60&s=5ec9fed65089e3686fa60f5621cff796)
##### While having fun

A VPN lets you enjoy the sites and services you like without ISP throttling that could detract from your experience or outright blocking by your ISP or local Wi-Fi network.

![Stay safe on public Wi-Fi: using a laptop in a coffee shop.](https://xv.imgix.net/photos/xv/wifi-vpn-b9186af152171680050ec847e06b8dbd.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&fit=max&w=440&q=60&s=664ec7cadd03e03c75722491af95c20a)
##### While on public Wi-Fi

Connecting to public Wi-Fi hotspots like those in cafes, airports, and parks could leave your private information vulnerable. Using a VPN on your devices keeps you safe with strong encryption.

![Devices for gaming. ](https://xv.imgix.net/photos/xv/available-on-all-devices-round-628758f011caaaa25772388bc1dacedc.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&fit=max&w=440&q=60&s=b30dfab9fc273d586025b6f44df8578a)
##### While gaming

Using a VPN unlocks games, maps, skins, and other add-ons that might be restricted on your network. It also shields you from DDoS attacks and reduces ping and overall lag.

![Download anonymously. Laptop with download icon.](https://xv.imgix.net/photos/xv/what-is-vpn-torrenting-round-baebef45de40c87a5aa713a7bc894f38.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&fit=max&w=440&q=60&s=ac261889ad6512e66431bd8a685ab344)
##### While file-sharing

P2P file sharing usually means that strangers can see your IP address and possibly track your downloads. A VPN keeps your IP address private, letting you download with increased anonymity.

Some online stores show different prices to people in different countries. With a VPN, you can find the best deals in the world no matter where youâre shopping from.

## How does a VPN work?

To understand how a VPN works, it helps to first understand how your internet connection works without one.

### Without a VPN

When you access a website without a VPN, you are being connected to that site through your internet service provider, or ISP. The ISP assigns you a **unique IP address** that can be used to identify you to the website. Because your ISP is handling and directing all your traffic, it can see which websites you visit. And your activity can be linked to you by that unique IP address.

### With a VPN

When you connect to the internet with a VPN, the VPN app on your device (also called a **VPN client**) establishes a secure connection with a **VPN server**. Your traffic still passes through your ISP, but your ISP can no longer read it or see its final destination. The websites you visit can no longer see your original IP address, only the IP address of the VPN server, which is shared by many other users and changes regularly.

Here are several key concepts related to VPN that will help you understand how a VPN works and the benefits it provides:

### Proxying

The VPN server acts like a **proxy**, or stand-in, for your web activity: Instead of your real IP address and location, websites you visit will only see the IP address and location of the VPN server.

This makes you more **anonymous** on the internet.

### Authentication

Establishing a secure connection is a tricky problem solved by clever mathematics in a process called **authentication**.

Once authenticated, the VPN client and VPN server can be sure they are talking to each other and no one else.

### Tunneling

VPNs also protect the connection between client and server with tunneling and encryption.

Tunneling is a process by which each data packet is **encapsulated** inside another data packet. This makes it harder for third parties to read in transit.

### Encryption

Data inside the tunnel is also **encrypted** in such a way that only the intended recipient can decrypt it. This keeps the contents of your internet traffic completely private. Even your internet service provider wonât see it.

## Types of VPN

![Laptop with a plant and drink.](https://xv.imgix.net/photos/xv/what-is-vpn-commercial-0cfe9d19bf2ef003833167338074949a.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&fit=max&w=440&q=60&s=9f70aaa4adb9e2c7dac7db7edd90d176)
##### Commercial VPN

A commercial VPN, also called a personal VPN or a consumer VPN, is a private service offered directly to individuals, usually for a fee.

ExpressVPN is such a VPN service because it directly caters to the privacy needs of its customers.

![Pie chart. ](https://xv.imgix.net/photos/xv/what-is-vpn-corporate-de01c1c30b6e672cf07aebad9215903f.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&fit=max&w=440&q=60&s=262053a22f94dee5039bb054216655a0)
##### Corporate VPN

A corporate VPN, also called a business VPN, allows an organizationâs remote employees to connect securely to the internet as if they were physically present in the office.

Unlike commercial VPNs, however, corporate VPNs are meant to protect the privacy of the company and not necessarily the individual.

##### Self-setup VPN

Some tech experts and DIY hobbyists choose to set up their own VPN using their own equipment.

Self-setup VPNs, however, do not provide the protection of shared IP addresses, server locations in multiple countries, or many other features enjoyed by commercial VPN users.

##### **How to choose a VPN provider?**

Choosing a VPN provider depends on your needs. Prioritize privacy features like a no-logs policy, encryption, and a kill switch. Look for fast servers and a large number of server locations to ensure smooth streaming, gaming, and bypassing geographic restrictions. For censorship resistance, choose a VPN with proven reliability in restricted regions. Finally, ensure the VPN supports your devices and offers 24/7 customer support.

##### **What are the most important things when it comes to VPN?**

Strong security, fast speeds, wide server locations, and reliable connections are among a VPN's most important features. Look for advanced encryption, a no-logs policy, and a kill switch for privacy. Choose a VPN with high-speed servers and global coverage to ensure smooth browsing and streaming.

##### **Are VPNs legal?**

Yes, VPNs are legal in most countries and are commonly used by individuals and businesses to protect privacy and secure online activity. However, some countries with strict internet regulations may restrict or monitor VPN use. Always check local laws if youâre unsure. Keep in mind, using a VPN doesnât make illegal activities legal.

##### **Is ExpressVPN trustworthy?**

Yes, ExpressVPN is highly trustworthy. Its strict no-logs policy, independently audited by third-party firms, ensures your online activity is never recorded.

For security and performance, a premium VPN is the safer choice.

##### **Can VPN bypass censorship?**

Yes, VPNs can bypass censorship by encrypting your internet traffic and routing it through secure servers in other countries. This masks your real IP address, making it appear as though youâre browsing from a different location. Advanced VPNs also use obfuscation technology to bypass firewalls in heavily restricted regions, ensuring access to blocked websites and apps.
