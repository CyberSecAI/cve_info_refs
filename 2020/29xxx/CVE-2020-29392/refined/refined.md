Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities discussed in the presentation. While the content does not explicitly mention CVE-2020-29392, it does describe two backdoors found in two applications, one on Windows and one on iOS. Here's the breakdown for each.

**Windows Application Backdoor**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A hidden administrative interface was implemented for developer maintenance purposes. The access to this interface relied on a hardcoded seed value combined with the current date/time to generate a password.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Hidden Functionality:** The existence of the admin interface was not obvious to regular users and was activated by a specific key combination.
    *   **Weak Password Generation:**  The password generation mechanism, while dynamic (changes weekly), is deterministic due to the hardcoded seed value. This allows anyone with access to the application code to compute the password.
    *   **Lack of Security by Design:** The application did not enforce proper security controls, relying on the obscurity of the backdoor rather than robust authentication.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could elevate their privileges by accessing the hidden admin interface.
    *   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Once elevated, attackers could execute arbitrary database queries (stored procedures or raw SQL). This allows them to view sensitive data (e.g., user login sessions), change passwords of other users, and potentially manipulate other sensitive information.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local access** Attacker needs to have access to the computer where the application is installed to press the correct key combination during the application startup.
   *   **Reverse Engineering**: Attacker need to reverse engineer the application to extract the hardcoded seed and understand the password generation algorithm.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Basic Reverse Engineering Skills:**  The attacker needs to be able to use tools like IDA or WinDBG to inspect the application binary and understand the password generation logic.
    *   **Local Access:** The attacker would need local access to the machine running the application to initiate the backdoor.

**iOS Application Backdoor**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The password manager app contained a hidden backdoor that allows bypassing password verification using a specific input ("\*#06#\*").
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Hardcoded Backdoor:** The presence of the "*#06#*" input to bypass password checks is a blatant backdoor.
    *   **Unencrypted Storage of Master Password:**  The master password was found stored in an unencrypted plist file.
    *  **Insecure Password Verification:** The primary password check simply compares the input to the correct password, with an alternative backdoor check.
    *   **Lack of Security Awareness:** The developers did not consider the security implications of their design.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Bypass Authentication:**  Attackers could bypass the master password authentication of the password manager using the backdoor.
   *    **Data Breach:** Access to stored passwords within the application, given the master password bypass.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Physical Access:** An attacker needs physical access to the user's iOS device to input the backdoor string, either by entering the backdoor string as the password or via tampering of application data.
    *   **App Data Extraction:** The unencrypted master password stored in plist makes it easier to extract the password without interacting with the application interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Physical Access to the Device:** The attacker needs physical access to the device to exploit the backdoor or extract the application data.
    *  **Basic understanding of iOS application structure:** The attacker needs to understand where the application data is stored and how to retrieve it.

**Summary**

Both backdoors highlight serious security flaws resulting from poor development practices, such as including hidden administrative interfaces, and a lack of security-by-design thinking. The Windows backdoor had a complex attack vector, but a large impact, while the iOS backdoor had an easier attack vector but an equivalent impact. The vulnerabilities are further exacerbated by the fact that one allowed administrative access to a critical application, and the other allowed anyone to bypass the master password in a password manager.
