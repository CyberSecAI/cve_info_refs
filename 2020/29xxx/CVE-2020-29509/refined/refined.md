Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability CVE-2020-29509:

**Description:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Go's `encoding/xml` package.
*   The `encoding/xml` package handles namespace prefixes on XML attributes in a way that causes crafted markup to mutate during round-trips through the `xml.Decoder` and `xml.Encoder` implementations.
*   Encoding and decoding using Go's `encoding/xml` can change the observed namespace as well as the observed local name of a maliciously crafted XML attribute.

**Root Cause:**

*   Misinterpretation of Input (CWE-115). The `encoding/xml` package doesn't correctly handle namespace prefixes on XML attributes, leading to mutations during encoding and decoding cycles.

**Impact:**

*   Mutations caused by encoding round-trips can lead to incorrect or conflicting decisions in affected applications.
*   Equivalent lookups within an XML document can return different results during different stages of the document's lifecycle.
*   Attempting to validate the structure of an XML document can succeed or fail depending on the number of encoding round-trips it has gone through.
*   In SAML implementations, this can lead to authentication bypass and privilege escalation. An affected SAML implementation might interpret an assertion as signed but then read values from an unsigned part of the document due to namespace mutations between signature verification and data access.

**Affected Applications:**

*   Applications that rely on XML integrity for security-sensitive decisions (e.g., SAML and XML-DSig implementations).

**Attack Vector:**

*   Crafted XML markup with malicious namespace prefixes on attributes.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability involves mutating namespace prefixes during XML encoding/decoding. This can change the meaning of attributes and elements, leading to security issues.

**Affected Versions:**

*   All versions of the `encoding/xml` package in Go are affected.

**CVSS Score:**

*   9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) according to the Github advisory
*   5.6 (MEDIUM) CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L according to the NetApp advisory

**Workaround:**

*   The `github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator` module can detect unstable constructs in an XML document, including unstable attribute namespace prefixes. Using this validator to check untrusted markup can prevent exploitation.

**Mitigation (NetApp):**

*   NetApp released a fix in Astra Trident version v21.10.0.
