- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in the configuration backup functionality of the Sagemcom router.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The router allows unauthenticated requests to download the configuration file (`backupsettings.conf`) as long as there is a valid session running in the router's web interface. This bypasses authentication and authorization checks for accessing the backup configuration.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The `backupsettings.conf` file contains sensitive information, including the administration username and password, potentially leading to full compromise of the router. If "Remote Configuration Management" is enabled, the configuration file can be accessed over the WAN via TCP:6080.
- **Attack vectors:** 
    -  An attacker can send an unauthenticated HTTP GET request to `http://<router-ip>/backupsettings.conf` while a valid session is active on the router's web interface.
    - If remote configuration management is active, the request can be made over the WAN at  `http://<router-wan-ip>:6080/backupsettings.conf`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must know the IP address of the router.
    - For LAN exploitation, the attacker must be on the same network as the router and there must be an active session on the router.
    - For WAN exploitation, the "Remote Configuration Management" setting must be enabled on the router.
