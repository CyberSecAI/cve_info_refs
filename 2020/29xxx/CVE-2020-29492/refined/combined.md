#### Workarounds & Mitigations

Below are best practices to address this issue. Dell recommends customers implement one of the following:

* Secure the file server environment when using Dell Wyse ThinOS 8.6 clients – Impacted ThinOS 8.6 customers can secure their environment by updating their file servers to use a secure protocol (HTTPS instead of HTTP or FTP) and by ensuring file servers are set to read-only access.
* Deploy Dell Wyse Management Suite – Impacted ThinOS 8.6 customers can use Wyse Management Suite instead of a file server for imaging and device configuration. Wyse Management Suite communications enforce HTTPS protocol and all configurations are stored in a secure server database instead of editable configuration files.
* Deploy Dell Wyse Management Suite with ThinOS 9 – In addition to deploying Wyse Management Suite, customers with eligible Wyse clients can update their operating system to ThinOS 9 free of charge. ThinOS 9 clients do not support file server configuration, and thus this exploit does not apply to Wyse clients running ThinOS 9.
