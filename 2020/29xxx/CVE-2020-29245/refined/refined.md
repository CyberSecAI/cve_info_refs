{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `readAtomData` function within the `mp4.go` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The code attempts to access a slice with a fixed length of 4 bytes (`[:4]`) without properly checking if the slice's capacity is at least 4. When the input slice `b` has a capacity of 3, this results in a panic due to an out-of-bounds access.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability leads to a panic, which can crash the program. This may result in denial of service and potentially lead to further security issues depending on how the application handles such crashes.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted MP4 file where the size of the data read into the slice `b` results in `len(b)` being less than 4.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to supply a specially crafted MP4 file, where the size of `b` is 3, to the `readAtomData` function within the tag library."
