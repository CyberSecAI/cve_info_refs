Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29059:

**Verification:**

The provided content directly mentions "Backdoor Access with telnet - CVE-2020-29059" and provides details related to it. Thus, this content is relevant to the CVE.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the presence of hardcoded, undocumented credentials for a telnet service that is enabled on the device. These credentials allow unauthorized access to the device's command-line interface (CLI).

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Backdoor Account:** The presence of hardcoded credentials like `suma123/panger123`, `debug/debug124`, `root/root126`, and `guest/[empty]` indicates a deliberate backdoor mechanism.
    *   **Telnet Service Exposure:** The telnet service is exposed on both the WAN interface and the FTTH LAN interface, making it accessible to a wide range of potential attackers.
    *   **Lack of Proper Authentication:** The device allows access with these hardcoded credentials, completely bypassing normal authentication procedures.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete administrator-level access to the device's CLI. This access enables the attacker to:
    *   Overwrite device configuration
    *   Overwrite device firmware
    *   Potentially cause denial-of-service
    *   Access other network resources

*  **Attack Vectors:**
   *   The attack vector is remote via the telnet service. 
   *   The telnet service is reachable from the WAN interface, and the FTTH LAN interface (from the ONTs).

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable device on either the WAN or FTTH LAN interface.
    *   The attacker must know or guess one of the hardcoded username/password pairs.
    *   No prior authentication is needed.

**Additional Information:**

* The content provides specific hardcoded credentials for different firmware versions of the affected devices.
* It highlights that these credentials grant different levels of access, including administrator-level privileges.
* The content indicates that the vulnerability affects a wide range of CDATA OLT models due to code similarities.
