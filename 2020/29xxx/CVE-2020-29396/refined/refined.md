Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient sanitization of the default sandbox environment within Odoo when running with Python 3.6 or later. This sandbox is used for interpreting dynamic business logic components.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate sandboxing: The sandbox designed to isolate dynamic code execution was not properly secured, allowing for escape.
- Code injection: Malicious users can inject code specifically crafted to bypass sandbox restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Privilege escalation: The attacker can execute code with the privileges of the user running the Odoo service, potentially gaining access to local files, services and sensitive information such as passwords.
- System compromise: This can lead to further compromise of the hosting machine itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network exploitation: The vulnerability is network exploitable.
- Code injection through dynamic expressions used in workflows, automated actions or report templates

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to have an internal user account on the Odoo database.
- Knowledge of code injection: The attacker needs to be able to craft code expressions designed to escape the sandbox.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Odoo Community and Enterprise editions from versions 11.0 through 13.0 when running with Python 3.6 or later.
- Odoo S.A. is not aware of any in-the-wild exploitation.
- Patches are available for each affected version, and upgrading to the latest revision is recommended.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 9.9, classified as critical. The CVSS vector is: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L, and according to another source CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
- The issue is tracked by GitHub Security Advisory GHSA-fg5r-c9qq-q3wm.
