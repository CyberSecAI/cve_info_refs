Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-29550

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the storage of the Microsoft Office 365 Integration Service user account password in plaintext.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the cleartext storage of sensitive information (CWE-312) which leads to exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor (CWE-200)
*   **Impact:** An attacker gaining access to the configuration files, database, or HTML code could obtain the plaintext password, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the integrated MS Office 365 service and/or the URVE system itself.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Direct access to the server file system. The advisory lists specific files where the password is stored.
    *   Access to the database.
    *   Web interface access. The password is included in the HTML source of a specific page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs access to the server's file system, database, or be able to access the affected web interface to view the HTML source.
    *   No special privileges are explicitly required, but access to server resources or the application's web interface would be necessary.

**Technical Details:**

*   The affected software is URVE Software, specifically build "24.03.2020."
*   The plaintext password is found in the following files:
    *   `Profiles/urve/files/sql_db.backup`
    *   `Server/data/pg_wal/000000010000000A000000DD`
    *   `Server/data/base/16384/18617`
    *   `Server/data/base/17202/8708746`
*   The password is also exposed in the HTML code of the following URL: `/urve/roomsreservationimport/roomsreservationimport/update-HTML5?id=<id>`, within an input tag: `<input id="roomsreservationimport_password" [...] value="clearTextPassword">`.
* The recommended solution is to store the password as a cryptographic hash value.

**Additional Information:**
*   The advisory was created by Erik Steltzner and Christoph Ritter of SySS GmbH.
*   The vendor (Eveo Sp. z o.o.) was notified on 2020-11-10 and released a patch on 2020-11-18. The public disclosure was on 2020-12-23.
