Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-29144:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the Ericsson BSCS iX R18 Billing & Rating platform, specifically within the ADMX and MX modules. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored on the server and executed when other users (including administrators) view the affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** The injected XSS can be used to steal user session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim user.
- **Account Takeover:** By stealing session cookies, the attacker could gain full control over user accounts.
- **Admin Browser Exploitation:** The attacker could exploit the browsers of administrators using frameworks like BeEF, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, XSS can be leveraged to perform a wide variety of attacks, including potentially executing arbitrary code within the context of the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **ADMX Module:** An attacker can inject XSS payload into the description field of a newly created "Access Rights Group" under the "Reference Data" section.
- **MX Module:** An attacker can inject XSS payload into the "comment" section of any alert within the "Alert Dashboard".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the Ericsson BSCS iX R18 platform to access the vulnerable modules and inject the malicious payloads.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the application to trigger the vulnerability.
