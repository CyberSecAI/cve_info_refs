      "vulnerability": "STARTTLS command injection vulnerability",
      "cwe": "CWE-74 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')",
       "description": "The provided content references CVE-2020-29548 which was assigned to SmarterMail due to a STARTTLS command injection vulnerability. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject plaintext commands with the STARTTLS command to the server in the same TCP segment. The server interprets these commands as part of the encrypted connection. This vulnerability can be used to steal credentials, perform cross-protocol attacks, and potentially forge mailbox content. The vulnerability stems from how the server processes the commands during the transition from an insecure to a secure connection via STARTTLS.",
      "impact": "An attacker can steal login credentials, inject commands, perform cross-protocol attacks, and forge mailbox content.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a Meddler-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack that intercepts and modifies network traffic between an email client and server. The attacker injects commands along with the STARTTLS command before the TLS handshake.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires the ability to perform a MitM attack on network traffic, and can modify network traffic between the email client and server. The attacker also requires login credentials for their own account on the same server in order to exploit this vulnerability.",
