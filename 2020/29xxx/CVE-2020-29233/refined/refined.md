Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29233:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "Page description" field of WonderCMS, specifically in version 3.1.3.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious script into the application's database/storage. This is a stored XSS vulnerability, as opposed to reflected XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of the user's browser when they visit the website.
- This can lead to stealing cookies, session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- The attacker can gain unauthorized access to user accounts and perform malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects the malicious script through the vulnerable "Page description" field.
- The attacker utilizes the website's built-in editor interface.
- The injected script is then stored and executed every time a user visits the website, potentially affecting all users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the page description in the affected WonderCMS installation.
- No special privilege is required as long as the attacker can access the website's editing interface.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit demonstrates the vulnerability with a specific payload: `HemantSoloHacker"><img src=x onerror=confirm(1)>`. This payload utilizes an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` event handler, which triggers JavaScript execution, demonstrating the ability to run arbitrary scripts.

The vulnerable parameter is the `content` parameter in a `POST` request sent to the server when updating the page description.
