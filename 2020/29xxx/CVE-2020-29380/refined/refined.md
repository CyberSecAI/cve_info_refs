This document describes multiple vulnerabilities found in V-SOL OLTs.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Backdoor Access with Telnet:**
    *   **Root cause:** The devices have a telnet server running that is accessible from both the WAN interface and the FTTH LAN interface (from the ONTs).
    *   **Weaknesses:** Hardcoded credentials (`login: admin`, `password: !j@l#y$z%x6x7q8c9z)`) allow low-privilege CLI access.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the device.
    *   **Attack vector:** Network access to the telnet port
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access to the telnet port, knowledge of hardcoded credentials.
2.  **Enable Backdoor:**
    *   **Root cause:**  The same password used for initial login (`!j@l#y$z%x6x7q8c9z)`) can be used to elevate privileges to a complete administrator CLI access using the `enable` command.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Hardcoded password for privilege escalation.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can gain full administrative control, allowing for complete configuration overwrites and firmware modifications.
    *   **Attack vector:** Exploitation of the Telnet backdoor, using the enable command.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:**  Low-privilege access via telnet, knowledge of the hardcoded enable password.
3.  **Hardcoded RSA Keys:**
    *   **Root cause:** The firmware images contain hardcoded RSA keys used for SSL encryption of the web server.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Use of hardcoded keys.
    *  **Impact:**  An attacker can intercept passwords sent in clear text and perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks on the management interface.
    *   **Attack vector:** Interception of network traffic
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to intercept network traffic, knowledge of the hardcoded RSA key.
4.  **Potential Command Injection:**
    *   **Root cause:** The `upload tftp` command utilizes user-supplied input without sanitization.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Vulnerability to command injection in TFTP file transfer functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands as root on the device.
    *   **Attack vector:** Exploitation of the `upload tftp` command.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Low-privilege CLI access.
5.  **Code Quality:**
    *   **Root cause:** The `init.sh` script starts `telnetd` without authentication during updates.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insecure `telnetd` startup during updates.
    *   **Impact:** Creates a window of opportunity for unauthorized access during updates.
    *   **Attack vector:** Network access during the update process.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Timing the attack with an update.
6.  **Backdoor Used for Account Creation:**
    *   **Root cause:** A specific string (`4ef9cea10b2362f15ba4558b1d5c081f`) is used as a backdoor password when creating new users.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Backdoor account creation functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Allows creation of admin users from non-admin accounts.
    *   **Attack vector:**  Exploitation of the user creation functionality.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Knowledge of backdoor string.
7.  **Backdoor specific to V1600D model:**
    *   **Root cause:** A hardcoded string `K0LTdi@gnos312$` is used as a backdoor password.
    *  **Weaknesses:** Hardcoded credentials.
    *  **Impact:** Allows unauthorized access.
    *   **Attack vector:** Network access
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Knowledge of the hardcoded password.
8. **Insecure management interfaces:**
    *   **Root cause:** Management interfaces default to HTTP, HTTPS, telnet and SNMP, with hardcoded keys used for SSL.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insecure protocols and hardcoded keys.
    *   **Impact:** Vulnerable to password sniffing and MITM attacks, compromising the management of the device.
    *   **Attack vector:** Network interception.
    *  **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to intercept network traffic.

The advisory states that full-disclosure is applied due to the belief that some backdoors are intentionally placed by the vendor.
The identified vulnerabilities allow for unauthorized access, privilege escalation, command injection, and MITM attacks, potentially leading to complete control over the affected devices.
