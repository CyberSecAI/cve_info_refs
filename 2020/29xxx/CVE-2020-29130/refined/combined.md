Subject: CVE-2020-29129 CVE-2020-29130 QEMU: slirp: out-of-bounds access
 while processing ARP/NCSI packets

   Hello,

An out-of-bounds access issue was found in the SLiRP user networking
implementation of QEMU. It could occur while processing ARP/NCSI packets, if
the packet length was shorter than required to accommodate respective protocol
headers and payload. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to potentially
leak host information bytes.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> <https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/slirp/2020-November/000115.html>

* This issue was reported by Qiuhao Li (cc'd).

* CVE-2020-29129 CVE-2020-29130 assigned via -> <https://cveform.mitre.org/>

Thank you.

#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

From: Prasad J Pandit <[pjp at fedoraproject.org](https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/slirp)>

While processing ARP/NCSI packets in 'arp_input' or 'ncsi_input'
routines, ensure that pkt_len is large enough to accommodate the
respective protocol headers, lest it should do an OOB access.
Add check to avoid it.

Package        : qemu
Version        : 1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u13
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-15469 CVE-2020-15859 CVE-2020-25084 CVE-2020-28916
                 CVE-2020-29130 CVE-2020-29443 CVE-2021-20181 CVE-2021-20221
Debian Bug     : 970253 965978 970539 974687 976388

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in QEMU, a fast processor
emulator (notably used in KVM and Xen HVM virtualization). An attacker
could trigger a denial-of-service (DoS), information leak, and
possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU
process on the host.

CVE-2020-15469

    A MemoryRegionOps object may lack read/write callback methods,
    leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2020-15859

    QEMU has a use-after-free in hw/net/e1000e_core.c because a guest
    OS user can trigger an e1000e packet with the data's address set
    to the e1000e's MMIO address.

CVE-2020-25084

    QEMU has a use-after-free in hw/usb/hcd-xhci.c because the
    usb_packet_map return value is not checked.

CVE-2020-28916

    hw/net/e1000e_core.c has an infinite loop via an RX descriptor
    with a NULL buffer address.

CVE-2020-29130

    slirp.c has a buffer over-read because it tries to read a certain
    amount of header data even if that exceeds the total packet
    length.

CVE-2020-29443

    ide_atapi_cmd_reply_end in hw/ide/atapi.c allows out-of-bounds
    read access because a buffer index is not validated.

CVE-2021-20181

    9pfs: ZDI-CAN-10904: QEMU Plan 9 file system TOCTOU privilege
    escalation vulnerability.

CVE-2021-20221

    aarch64: GIC: out-of-bound heap buffer access via an interrupt ID
    field.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u13.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

For the detailed security status of qemu please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/qemu>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Package        : qemu
Version        : 1:3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u10
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-14394 CVE-2020-29130 CVE-2021-3592 CVE-2021-3593
                 CVE-2021-3594 CVE-2021-3595 CVE-2022-0216 CVE-2022-1050
Debian Bug     : 970937 979677 986795 989993 989994 989995 989996 1014589 1014590

Multiple security issues were discovered in QEMU, a fast processor
emulator, which could result in denial of service, information leak,
or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2020-14394

    An infinite loop flaw was found in the USB xHCI controller
    emulation of QEMU while computing the length of the Transfer
    Request Block (TRB) Ring. This flaw allows a privileged guest user
    to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of
    service.

CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2021-3409

    A heap-based buffer overflow was found in QEMU in the SDHCI device
    emulation support. It could occur while doing a multi block SDMA
    transfer via the sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks() routine in
    hw/sd/sdhci.c. A guest user or process could use this flaw to
    crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of
    service condition, or potentially execute arbitrary code with
    privileges of the QEMU process on the host.

CVE-2020-29130

    slirp.c has a buffer over-read because it tries to read a certain
    amount of header data even if that exceeds the total packet
    length.

CVE-2021-3592

    An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP
    networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the
    bootp_input() function and could occur while processing a udp
    packet that is smaller than the size of the 'bootp_t' structure. A
    malicious guest could use this flaw to leak 10 bytes of
    uninitialized heap memory from the host.

CVE-2021-3593

    An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP
    networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the
    udp6_input() function and could occur while processing a udp
    packet that is smaller than the size of the 'udphdr'
    structure. This issue may lead to out-of-bounds read access or
    indirect host memory disclosure to the guest.

CVE-2021-3594

    An invalid pointer initialization issue was found
    in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in
    the udp_input() function and could occur while processing a udp
    packet that is smaller than the size of the 'udphdr'
    structure. This issue may lead to out-of-bounds read access or
    indirect host memory disclosure to the guest.

CVE-2021-3595

    An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP
    networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the
    tftp_input() function and could occur while processing a udp
    packet that is smaller than the size of the 'tftp_t'
    structure. This issue may lead to out-of-bounds read access or
    indirect host memory disclosure to the guest.

CVE-2022-0216

    A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the LSI53C895A SCSI
    Host Bus Adapter emulation of QEMU. The flaw occurs while
    processing repeated messages to cancel the current SCSI request
    via the lsi_do_msgout function. This flaw allows a malicious
    privileged user within the guest to crash the QEMU process on the
    host, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2022-1050

    A flaw was found in the QEMU implementation of VMWare's
    paravirtual RDMA device. This flaw allows a crafted guest driver
    to execute HW commands when shared buffers are not yet allocated,
    potentially leading to a use-after-free condition.
    Note: PVRDMA is disabled in buster, but this was fixed
    preventively in case this changes in the future.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u10.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

its security tracker page at:
