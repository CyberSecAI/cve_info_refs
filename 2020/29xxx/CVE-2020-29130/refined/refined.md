{
  "CVE-2020-29130": {
    "root_cause": "The SLiRP user networking implementation of QEMU has a vulnerability where it does not properly validate packet lengths before accessing data.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged guest user may use this flaw to potentially leak host information bytes or cause a denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing specially crafted ARP/NCSI packets that are shorter than required."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "A privileged guest user can send malicious packets."
    ],
     "details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `arp_input` or `ncsi_input` routines within the slirp.c file of QEMU. When processing ARP/NCSI packets, the code attempts to read header information without first ensuring that the packet is large enough to contain the header data. This leads to an out-of-bounds read access. Specifically the code tries to read past the end of packet.  A patch was introduced to check `pkt_len` before accessing the header data."
