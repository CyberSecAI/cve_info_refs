Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-29607:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the file upload functionality of Pluck CMS, specifically the "manage files" feature.
- The application uses a blacklist approach to prevent the upload of malicious files. It attempts to block certain extensions, however this blacklist is incomplete and can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incomplete Blacklist:** The primary weakness is the use of a blacklist to filter file extensions, which is easily bypassed by using extensions not on the blacklist. Specifically, the `.phar` extension is not blocked, allowing an attacker to upload PHP code.
-   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application does not properly restrict the type of files that can be uploaded to the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file (e.g., a web shell) with a `.phar` extension, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
-   **Full System Compromise:** Successful RCE can lead to a complete compromise of the affected server, allowing the attacker to gain control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the web interface of Pluck CMS.
-   **File Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered when an authenticated user uploads a malicious file through the "manage files" section.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authentication:** The attacker must have administrative access to the Pluck CMS admin panel.
-   **Web Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Pluck CMS instance.
-   **Upload Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to access the "manage files" functionality to upload arbitrary files.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `files.php`, specifically lines 44-45, where the blacklist filtering is implemented.
- A python script was provided to demonstrate the exploit. This script first authenticates to the CMS, and then uploads a file named `shell.phar`. This file is a PHP webshell that provides code execution.
- The exploit uses `multipart/form-data` to upload the malicious file.
- The attacker would subsequently access the uploaded file via `http://<server>/files/shell.phar` to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Mitigation:**
- The report suggests implementing a whitelist approach rather than a blacklist for file extensions.
- It also recommends renaming uploaded files with random filenames and removing the file extension to prevent direct execution.
- Finally, it suggests implementing `.htaccess` rules to prevent PHP file execution in the upload directory.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is a bypass of a previously discovered file upload vulnerability.
- The provided exploit is authenticated and requires a valid admin password.
- The tested and vulnerable versions include Pluck CMS version 4.7.13 and earlier.
