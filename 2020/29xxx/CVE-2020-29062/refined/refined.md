The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in CDATA OLTs, including one related to CVE-2020-29062:

**CVE-2020-29062: Backdoor Access with telnet**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The OLT devices have a telnet server running that is accessible from both the WAN interface and the FTTH LAN interface.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hardcoded, undocumented credentials (backdoors) are present in the firmware, which grant an attacker full administrative CLI access. These credentials vary depending on the firmware version. Examples include `suma123/panger123`, `debug/debug124`, `root/root126`, and `guest/[empty]`.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with these credentials can completely overwrite the configuration and firmware of the device.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker can connect to the telnet server from either the WAN interface or the FTTH LAN interface and log in using the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the OLT's telnet server on port 23 and the knowledge of the hardcoded credentials associated with the specific firmware version.
