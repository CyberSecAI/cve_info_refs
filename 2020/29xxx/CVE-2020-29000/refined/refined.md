Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the RTSP service of the Geeni GNC-CW013 doorbell device. This flaw allows a remote attacker to gain full control over the device by sending a crafted message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The device's RTSP service does not properly control access, allowing a remote attacker to execute commands with high privileges.
*   **Remote Command Execution:** By sending a crafted message, the attacker can initiate a reverse telnet session on the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Device Control:** A successful exploit grants the attacker complete control of the doorbell device with a high-privileged account.
*   **Access to Camera System:** The attacker gains access to the camera system, potentially allowing them to view live feeds and recordings.
*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability enables the attacker to remotely log in to the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack is carried out remotely over the network.
*   **Crafted UDP Message:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted UDP message to the device.
*   **DNS Control:** An attacker who controls DNS can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send UDP messages to the vulnerable device.
*   **DNS Control (Optional):** If the attacker controls the DNS, they can potentially more easily locate and target the device, however this is not a hard requirement.
*   **Crafted Message Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to craft the specific UDP message to trigger the vulnerability.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability described in CVE-2020-29000 allows a remote attacker to take complete control of a Geeni GNC-CW013 doorbell through a flaw in its RTSP service. By sending a crafted UDP message, the attacker can initiate a telnet session and gain high-privileged access to the device, including its camera system. This vulnerability is remotely exploitable and requires the attacker to have network access to the device and the ability to craft the malicious message. Control over DNS would make exploitation easier.
