Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-29142:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the ineffective use of the `add_escape_custom()` function within the `interface/usergroup/usergroup_admin.php` file. This function is intended to sanitize input but fails to properly enclose the escaped input with quotes, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability due to the improper sanitization of user-supplied data before it's used in a SQL query. Specifically, the `add_escape_custom()` function escapes characters but doesn't wrap the result in quotes, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, modifying data, or taking control of the database. The provided examples demonstrate the ability to extract the database user or version information.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/interface/usergroup/usergroup_admin.php` endpoint. The attacker manipulates the `schedule_facility[]` parameter to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Administrator access:** The attacker must have administrator-level access to the OpenEMR application. Additionally, the global setting `restrict_user_facility` must be enabled.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the OpenEMR server.
- **Knowledge of the target:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable parameters and the proper format of SQL injection to exploit the flaw.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `interface/usergroup/usergroup_admin.php` at line 150:
  ```php
  and facility_id not in (" . add_escape_custom(implode(",", $_POST['schedule_facility'])) . ")", array($_POST["id"]));
  ```
- The `add_escape_custom()` function is a wrapper for `mysqli_real_escape_string()`.
- The exploit involves sending a POST request with a manipulated `schedule_facility[]` parameter to inject SQL into the query. The provided examples use `extractvalue(0x0a,concat(0x0a,(user())))` and `extractvalue(0x0a,concat(0x0a,(version())))` to extract user and version information.
- The vulnerability is confirmed to exist in OpenEMR versions 6.0.0-dev and 5.0.2(5).
- To enable the vulnerability, the attacker must first execute the following SQL query:
  ```sql
  UPDATE `globals` SET `gl_value` = '1' WHERE `globals`.`gl_name` = 'restrict_user_facility'
  ```
