{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the 'Full Name' field during user registration. This unsanitized input is then displayed on the admin 'Manage User' page, causing the stored XSS vulnerability.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. When an administrator views the 'Manage User' section, the malicious code executes in their browser within the context of the admin's session. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions against the admin user.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the user registration process where a user, or malicious actor, enters a crafted XSS payload into the 'Full Name' field. This payload is then stored in the application's database and displayed on the admin side.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the user registration page and submit the crafted XSS payload. The attack then targets admin users who access the manage user section."
    }
