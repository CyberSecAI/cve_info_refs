- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `w` parameter in `index.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `w` parameter and tricks a user into visiting that URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and induce the victim to open it.
