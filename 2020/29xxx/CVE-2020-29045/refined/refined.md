Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-29045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `unserialize()` function in the `includes/class-cart-manager.php` file of the "Five Star Restaurant Menu" WordPress plugin. This function is used to process data from the `fdm_cart` cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Deserialization:** The plugin directly deserializes data from the `fdm_cart` cookie without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized PHP objects into the cookie.
- **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a malicious serialized object, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server. This is possible because the deserialized object can trigger code execution through PHP's magic methods (e.g., `__wakeup`, `__destruct`) in conjunction with other "gadget" classes present in the application or its dependencies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the WordPress site. This can lead to:
    - Complete control of the website.
    - Data breaches.
    - Malware injection.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Server compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Cookie:** The primary attack vector is through a crafted `fdm_cart` cookie sent in an HTTP request to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the target WordPress site to send HTTP requests containing the malicious cookie.
- **Knowledge of PHP unserialization vulnerabilities:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft a malicious serialized PHP object that can be used to achieve RCE within the context of the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Nick Blundell of AppCheck Ltd on 2020-11-17.
- The vendor was contacted multiple times, but did not respond initially.
- The WordPress Security Team was informed, and a fix was released on 2021-01-11 in version 2.2.1 of the plugin.
- The vulnerable versions are <= 2.2.0.

In summary, this is a critical vulnerability that allows unauthenticated attackers to gain complete control over a WordPress site running a vulnerable version of the "Five Star Restaurant Menu" plugin. This is due to unsafe deserialization of user-controlled data, leading to arbitrary code execution.
