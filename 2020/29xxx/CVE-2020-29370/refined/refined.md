    "cve": "CVE-2020-29370",
    "description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate Linux Kernel. Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.5.11 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "affected_products": [
      "NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault)",
      "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C",
      "NetApp HCI Compute Node (Bootstrap OS)",
      "NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node",
      "NetApp SolidFire Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)",
      "NetApp SolidFire, Enterprise SDS & HCI Storage Node (Element Software)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.5.11 where `kmem_cache_alloc_bulk()` does not properly bump the thread ID (TID) before calling `___slab_alloc()`, leading to a race condition.  Specifically, when kmem_cache_alloc_bulk attempts to allocate N objects from a percpu freelist of length M, and N > M > 0, it will first remove the M elements from the percpu freelist, then call ___slab_alloc() to allocate the next element and repopulate the percpu freelist. ___slab_alloc() can re-enable IRQs via allocate_slab(), so the TID must be bumped before ___slab_alloc() to properly commit the freelist head change.",

        "Improper handling of thread ID"

    "additional_details": {
        "affected_kernel_version": "Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.5.11",
         "fix_detail": "The fix involves unconditionally bumping the TID within `kmem_cache_alloc_bulk()` when entering the slowpath."
