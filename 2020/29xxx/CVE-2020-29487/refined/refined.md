Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-29487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how xenopsd (a Xen toolstack component) watches certain xenstore keys that provide feedback from the guest. When any of these watched keys are updated, xenopsd sends an RPC update containing all the data. The logic has O(N^2) time complexity where N is the number of watched keys and message-switch retains recent RPC messages leading to O(M*N) space complexity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inefficient update mechanism:** Xenopsd's handling of xenstore key updates has quadratic time complexity, leading to excessive resource consumption as the number of watched keys grows.
*   **Excessive memory usage:** The message-switch component retains recent RPC messages for diagnostic purposes, further contributing to the memory footprint. This, combined with inefficient update mechanism, leads to excessive memory consumption, especially when a guest modifies numerous xenstore keys.
*   **Lack of proper quota management:**  While xenstore has a quota mechanism, it is described as fairly large (believed to be over 1GB per guest), allowing a malicious guest to exploit the inefficient update mechanism significantly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Host Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious guest can trigger excessive memory usage in the host (dom0) by rapidly updating many xenstore keys. This can lead to message-switch thrashing against swap or completely running out of memory (OOM), resulting in a denial of service on the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Guest-triggered:** The attack vector involves a malicious or buggy guest manipulating its xenstore keys to trigger the inefficient update mechanism within xenopsd.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest Access:** The attacker needs to have control of a guest virtual machine on the vulnerable Xen hypervisor.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the XAPI toolstack.
*   Systems not using XAPI are not vulnerable.
*   The provided text includes patches to address the vulnerability, suggesting that the fix involves implementing quotas within xenopsd to limit the keys that trigger RPC traffic.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 202107-30) lists this CVE along with other Xen vulnerabilities, and indicates that the fix is to upgrade Xen to the specified version.
