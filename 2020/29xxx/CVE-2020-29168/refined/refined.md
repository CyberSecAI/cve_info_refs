Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application's `getuser.php` file directly uses the value of the `q` GET parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `q` parameter in the `getuser.php` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, allowing them to potentially:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., database schema, usernames, passwords).
    - Modify or delete data within the database.
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the application or the underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a malicious HTTP GET request to the `getuser.php` endpoint, including SQL injection payloads within the `q` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, since the injection is present in the vulnerable `getuser.php` file.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit payload demonstrates how to extract the database name using a `UNION ALL SELECT` injection.
- The vulnerable application is identified as "Online Doctor Appointment Booking System PHP and Mysql 1.0".
- The vulnerable code snippet is `mysqli_query($con,"SELECT * FROM doctorschedule WHERE scheduleDate='$q'");`, showing how the unsanitized `$q` parameter is directly used in the query.
- The content from Exploit-DB provides more detailed information and proof-of-concept on how to exploit this vulnerability.
