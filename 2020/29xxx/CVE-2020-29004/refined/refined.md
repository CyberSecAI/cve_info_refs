Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-29004:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `ApiPush` extension in MediaWiki does not properly validate the `targets` parameter. Additionally, the login request transmits the username and password in plain text.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Lack of target parameter validation:** The `ApiPush` extension doesn't verify the `targets` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary URLs.
*   **Plain text password transmission:** The login request sends username and password without encryption.
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** is tagged to the vulnerability, indicating that an attacker might be able to trick users into making unintended requests.
*   **Information Leak:** This is explicitly labeled as a vulnerability tag indicating the username and password in plain text is a source of leakage.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can create a malicious script and set the URL of this script as a target parameter to `ApiPush`. When the login request is performed by a user, the attacker's script can capture the user's credentials (username and password) in plain text.
*   The user's plain text credentials can be sent to an arbitrary location that the attacker controls.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing their script as the target in an API push request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted API push request with a controlled target URL.
*   The attacker does not need to be logged into the target system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker can then intercept the login credentials when the victim uses the vulnerable functionality.
