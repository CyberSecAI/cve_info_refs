{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Horizon's workflow forms lacked proper validation on the \"next\" parameter, allowing a malicious URL to be supplied, leading to an automatic redirect to that URL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Open redirect vulnerability due to lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when clicked, redirects the user to an arbitrary website, which could be used for phishing or other malicious activities. The malicious request can be a POST request, potentially sending sensitive data from the form to the attacker's server. This can be combined with XSS to bypass same-origin policies.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a manipulated \"next\" parameter and distribute it to users. The user may be socially engineered into clicking on it or the URL could be used in conjunction with an XSS vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the \"next\" parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled server. No special privileges are needed, only the ability to get a user to click the crafted link."
