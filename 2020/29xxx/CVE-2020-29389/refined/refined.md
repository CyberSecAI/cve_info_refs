Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29389:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The official Crux Linux Docker images, versions 3.0 through 3.4, were released with a blank password for the root user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- An empty/blank password for the root user is set in the `/etc/shadow` file within the affected Docker images.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could gain root access to systems using the vulnerable Crux Linux Docker containers.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Docker image itself.
- Attackers would exploit the blank root password to gain unauthorized access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to access the system using the vulnerable Docker container. This implies the attacker has network access to the host system running a vulnerable container.
- No authentication is needed since the password is blank.
