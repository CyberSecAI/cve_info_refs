Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the text file associated with CVE-2020-29001:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the presence of a static username and password compiled directly into the `ppsapp` RESTful application of the affected devices. This means the same credentials are used across all devices, making it a universal backdoor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The core weakness is the inclusion of static credentials within the application code.
*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The static credentials allow unauthorized access to high-privileged functions of the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Control of Device:** A remote attacker can gain complete control over the camera or doorbell.
*   **Password Hash Theft:** Attackers can steal password hashes, potentially gaining access to other user accounts related to the device.
*   **Telnet Service Enablement:** The attacker can enable the telnet service, likely for more direct interaction with the device's operating system.
*   **Access to Audio/Video Files:** The attacker can access stored audio and video files on the device, violating user privacy.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **RESTful API Exploitation:** The primary attack vector is through the RESTful Services API exposed by the affected devices.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs knowledge of the RESTful API endpoints and parameters used by the device's application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability allows access with default, static credentials, bypassing normal authentication.
**Affected Devices**
*   Geeni GNC-CW028 Camera 2.7.2
*   Geeni GNC-CW025 Doorbell 2.9.5
*   Merkury MI-CW024 Doorbell 2.9.6
*   Merkury MI-CW017 Camera 2.9.6
