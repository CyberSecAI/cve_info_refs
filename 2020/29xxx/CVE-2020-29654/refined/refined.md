- **Root cause of vulnerability**: DLL hijacking vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Western Digital Dashboard version 3.1.2.5 was susceptible to DLL hijacking. This occurs when an application loads a malicious DLL file instead of the intended one.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with system user privileges, potentially allowing a malicious user to escalate privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious user could place a specially crafted DLL file in a location where the Western Digital Dashboard would load it, leading to the execution of malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL file in a location that the vulnerable application searches during its loading process. This typically involves having some level of access to the target system.
