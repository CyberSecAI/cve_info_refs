# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

gup: document and work around "COW can break either way" issueDoing a "get\_user\_pages()" on a copy-on-write page for reading can be
ambiguous: the page can be COW'ed at any time afterwards, and the
direction of a COW event isn't defined.
Yes, whoever writes to it will generally do the COW, but if the thread
that did the get\_user\_pages() unmapped the page before the write (and
that could happen due to memory pressure in addition to any outright
action), the writer could also just take over the old page instead.
End result: the get\_user\_pages() call might result in a page pointer
that is no longer associated with the original VM, and is associated
with - and controlled by - another VM having taken it over instead.
So when doing a get\_user\_pages() on a COW mapping, the only really safe
thing to do would be to break the COW when getting the page, even when
only getting it for reading.
At the same time, some users simply don't even care.
For example, the perf code wants to look up the page not because it
cares about the page, but because the code simply wants to look up the
physical address of the access for informational purposes, and doesn't
really care about races when a page might be unmapped and remapped
elsewhere.
This adds logic to force a COW event by setting FOLL\_WRITE on any
copy-on-write mapping when FOLL\_GET (or FOLL\_PIN) is used to get a page
pointer as a result.
The current semantics end up being:
- \_\_get\_user\_pages\_fast(): no change. If you don't ask for a write,
you won't break COW. You'd better know what you're doing.
- get\_user\_pages\_fast(): the fast-case "look it up in the page tables
without anything getting mmap\_sem" now refuses to follow a read-only
page, since it might need COW breaking. Which happens in the slow
path - the fast path doesn't know if the memory might be COW or not.
- get\_user\_pages() (including the slow-path fallback for gup\_fast()):
for a COW mapping, turn on FOLL\_WRITE for FOLL\_GET/FOLL\_PIN, with
very similar semantics to FOLL\_FORCE.
If it turns out that we want finer granularity (ie "only break COW when
it might actually matter" - things like the zero page are special and
don't need to be broken) we might need to push these semantics deeper
into the lookup fault path. So if people care enough, it's possible
that we might end up adding a new internal FOLL\_BREAK\_COW flag to go
with the internal FOLL\_COW flag we already have for tracking "I had a
COW".
Alternatively, if it turns out that different callers might want to
explicitly control the forced COW break behavior, we might even want to
make such a flag visible to the users of get\_user\_pages() instead of
using the above default semantics.
But for now, this is mostly commentary on the issue (this commit message
being a lot bigger than the patch, and that patch in turn is almost all
comments), with that minimal "enable COW breaking early" logic using the
existing FOLL\_WRITE behavior.
[ It might be worth noting that we've always had this ambiguity, and it
could arguably be seen as a user-space issue.
You only get private COW mappings that could break either way in
situations where user space is doing cooperative things (ie fork()
before an execve() etc), but it \_is\_ surprising and very subtle, and
fork() is supposed to give you independent address spaces.
So let's treat this as a kernel issue and make the semantics of
get\_user\_pages() easier to understand. Note that obviously a true
shared mapping will still get a page that can change under us, so this
does \_not\_ mean that get\_user\_pages() somehow returns any "stable"
page ]

Debian Bug     : 986949 988352 989451

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service, or information leaks.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly
    of fragmented packets.  In some circumstances, an attacker within
    range of a network could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary
    packets and/or to access sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the "is
    aggregated" packet header flag.  An attacker within range of a
    network could exploit this to forge arbitrary packets on that
    network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

    kiyin (尹亮) of TenCent discovered several reference counting bugs
    in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to use-after-free.
    A local user could exploit these for denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered that
    the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that could
    result in use-after-free and double-free.  This has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

    kiyin (尹亮) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the NFC LLCP
    implementation.  A local user could exploit this for denial of
    service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211.  When operating in AP mode, they would
    forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender
    was not yet authenticated.  An attacker within range of a network
    could use this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting
    other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

    Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
    Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of
    it.  An attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they
    pair using Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the
    shared secret (Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices
    to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2021-3483

    马哲宇 (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the "nosy" driver for TI
    PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list corruption
    and a use-after-free.  On a system that uses this driver, local
    users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3506

    The ADLab of venustech discovered a bug in the F2FS driver which
    could lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing a crafted
    filesystem.  A local user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystems
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash) or other
    security impact.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

    The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the
    Bluetooth subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or
    double-free.  A local user could exploit these to caue a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

    Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential null
    pointer dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation.  A local user
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-23133

    Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the
    SCTP implementation, which can lead to list corruption.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

    It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930
    (XSA-365) introduced a potential resource leak.  A malicious guest
    could presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (resource exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

    Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which
    can lead to an assertion failure.  On systems using Btrfs, a local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

    Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for
    Intel PEBS.  A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs
    codenamed "Haswell" and earlier could lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  On systems with the affected CPUs, if users are
    permitted to access performance events, a local user may exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users do not have access to performance
    events, which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

    It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler
    for x86_64 generated incorrect branch instructions in some
    cases.  On systems where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could
    exploit this to execute arbitrary code in the kernel.

    By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.  This is
    controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29155, CVE-2021-31829

    Piotr Krysiuk and Benedict Schlueter discovered that the Extended
    BPF (eBPF) verifier did not completely protect against information
    leaks due to speculative execution.  A local user could exploit
    these to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2021-29264

    It was discovered that the "gianfar" Ethernet driver used with
    some Freescale SoCs did not correctly handle a Rx queue overrun
    when jumbo packets were enabled.  On systems using this driver and
    jumbo packets, an attacker on the network could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-29647

    The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC
    Router (qrtr) implementation.

    This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

    It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem
    could lead to a null pointer dereference during replacement of a
    table.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    namespace could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users cannot create user namespaces,
    which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-31916

    Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
    device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
    overrun.  However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
    (i.e. root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not
    have any security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

    The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.194-1~deb9u1.  This update additionally fixes Debian bug
#986949, #988352, and #989451; and includes many more bug fixes from

Which seems to be due to the fact that after allocating the uap
structure, nothing initializes the spinlock.
Its a little confusing, as uart\_port\_spin\_lock\_init() is one
place where the lock is supposed to be initialized, but it has
an exception for the case where the port is a console.
This makes it seem like a deeper fix is needed to properly
register the console, but I'm not sure what that entails, and
Andy suggested that this approach is less invasive.
Thus, this patch resolves the issue by initializing the spinlock
in the driver, and resolves the resulting warning.

KVM: arm64: Synchronize sysreg state on injecting an AArch32 exception
commit 0370964dd3ff7d3d406f292cb443a927952cbd05 upstream.
On a VHE system, the EL1 state is left in the CPU most of the time,
and only syncronized back to memory when vcpu\_put() is called (most
of the time on preemption).
Which means that when injecting an exception, we'd better have a way
to either:
(1) write directly to the EL1 sysregs
(2) synchronize the state back to memory, and do the changes there
For an AArch64, we already do (1), so we are safe. Unfortunately,
doing the same thing for AArch32 would be pretty invasive. Instead,
we can easily implement (2) by calling the put/load architectural
backends, and keep preemption disabled. We can then reload the
state back into EL1.

KVM: arm64: Save the host's PtrAuth keys in non-preemptible context
commit ef3e40a7ea8dbe2abd0a345032cd7d5023b9684f upstream.
When using the PtrAuth feature in a guest, we need to save the host's
keys before allowing the guest to program them. For that, we dump
them in a per-CPU data structure (the so called host context).
But both call sites that do this are in preemptible context,
which may end up in disaster should the vcpu thread get preempted
before reentering the guest.
Instead, save the keys eagerly on each vcpu\_load(). This has an
increased overhead, but is at least safe.

platform/x86: sony-laptop: SNC calls should handle BUFFER types
commit 47828d22539f76c8c9dcf2a55f18ea3a8039d8ef upstream.
After commit 6d232b29cfce ("ACPICA: Dispatcher: always generate buffer
objects for ASL create\_field() operator") ACPICA creates buffers even
when new fields are small enough to fit into an integer.
Many SNC calls counted on the old behaviour.
Since sony-laptop already handles the INTEGER/BUFFER case in
sony\_nc\_buffer\_call, switch sony\_nc\_int\_call to use its more generic
function instead.

block/floppy: fix contended case in floppy\_queue\_rq()
commit 263c61581a38d0a5ad1f5f4a9143b27d68caeffd upstream.
Since the switch of floppy driver to blk-mq, the contended (fdc\_busy) case
in floppy\_queue\_rq() is not handled correctly.
In case we reach floppy\_queue\_rq() with fdc\_busy set (i.e. with the floppy
locked due to another request still being in-flight), we put the request
on the list of requests and return BLK\_STS\_OK to the block core, without
actually scheduling delayed work / doing further processing of the
request. This means that processing of this request is postponed until
another request comes and passess uncontended.
Which in some cases might actually never happen and we keep waiting
indefinitely. The simple testcase is
for i in `seq 1 2000`; do echo -en $i '\r'; blkid --info /dev/fd0 2> /dev/null; done
run in quemu. That reliably causes blkid eventually indefinitely hanging
in \_\_floppy\_read\_block\_0() waiting for completion, as the BIO callback
never happens, and no further IO is ever submitted on the (non-existent)
floppy device. This was observed reliably on qemu-emulated device.
Fix that by not queuing the request in the contended case, and return
BLK\_STS\_RESOURCE instead, so that blk core handles the request
rescheduling and let it pass properly non-contended later.

mmc: sdio: Fix several potential memory leaks in mmc\_sdio\_init\_card()
commit a94a59f43749b4f8cd81b8be87c95f9ef898d19d upstream.
Over the years, the code in mmc\_sdio\_init\_card() has grown to become quite
messy. Unfortunate this has also lead to that several paths are leaking
memory in form of an allocated struct mmc\_card, which includes additional
data, such as initialized struct device for example.
Unfortunate, it's a too complex task find each offending commit. Therefore,
this change fixes all memory leaks at once.

mmc: sdio: Fix potential NULL pointer error in mmc\_sdio\_init\_card()
commit f04086c225da11ad16d7f9a2fbca6483ab16dded upstream.
During some scenarios mmc\_sdio\_init\_card() runs a retry path for the UHS-I
specific initialization, which leads to removal of the previously allocated
card. A new card is then re-allocated while retrying.
However, in one of the corresponding error paths we may end up to remove an
already removed card, which likely leads to a NULL pointer exception. So,
let's fix this.

commit 5d1f42e14b135773c0cc1d82e904c5b223783a9d upstream.
Currently, tmio\_mmc\_irq() handler is registered before the host is
fully initialized by tmio\_mmc\_host\_probe(). I did not previously notice
this problem.
The boot ROM of a new Socionext SoC unmasks interrupts (CTL\_IRQ\_MASK)
somehow. The handler is invoked before tmio\_mmc\_host\_probe(), then
emits noisy call trace.
Move devm\_request\_irq() below tmio\_mmc\_host\_probe().

mmc: tmio: Further fixup runtime PM management at remove
commit 4bd784411aca022622e484eb262f5a0540ae732c upstream.
Before calling tmio\_mmc\_host\_probe(), the caller is required to enable
clocks for its device, as to make it accessible when reading/writing
registers during probe.
Therefore, the responsibility to disable these clocks, in the error path of
->probe() and during ->remove(), is better managed outside
tmio\_mmc\_host\_remove(). As a matter of fact, callers of
tmio\_mmc\_host\_remove() already expects this to be the behaviour.
However, there's a problem with tmio\_mmc\_host\_remove() when the Kconfig
option, CONFIG\_PM, is set. More precisely, tmio\_mmc\_host\_remove() may then
disable the clock via runtime PM, which leads to clock enable/disable
imbalance problems, when the caller of tmio\_mmc\_host\_remove() also tries to
disable the same clocks.
To solve the problem, let's make sure tmio\_mmc\_host\_remove() leaves the
device with clocks enabled, but also make sure to disable the IRQs, as we
normally do at ->runtime\_suspend().

DMA api debug brings to light leaking dma-mappings, dma\_map\_sg and
dma\_unmap\_sg are not correctly balanced.
If a request is prepared, the dma\_map/unmap are done in asynchronous call
pre\_req (prep\_data) and post\_req (unprep\_data). In this case the
dma-mapping is right balanced.
But if the request was not prepared, the data->host\_cookie is define to
zero and the dma\_map/unmap must be done in the request. The dma\_map is
called by mmci\_dma\_start (prep\_data), but there is no dma\_unmap in this
case.
This patch adds dma\_unmap\_sg when the dma is finalized and the data cookie
is zero (request not prepared).

After changing the timing between GTT updates and execution on the GPU,
we started seeing sporadic failures on Ironlake. These were narrowed
down to being an insufficiently strong enough barrier/delay after
updating the GTT and scheduling execution on the GPU. By forcing the
uncached read, and adding the missing barrier for the singular
insert\_page (relocation paths), the sporadic failures go away.

commit 2ed6edd33a214bca02bd2b45e3fc3038a059436b upstream.
Under rare circumstances, task\_function\_call() can repeatedly fail and

There is a slight race where the process is no longer running on the cpu
we targeted by the time remote\_function() runs. The code will simply
try again. If we are very unlucky, this will continue to fail, until a
watchdog fires. This can happen in a heavily loaded, multi-core virtual
machine.

mm/slub: fix a memory leak in sysfs\_slab\_add()
commit dde3c6b72a16c2db826f54b2d49bdea26c3534a2 upstream.
syzkaller reports for memory leak when kobject\_init\_and\_add() returns an
error in the function sysfs\_slab\_add() [1]
When this happened, the function kobject\_put() is not called for the
corresponding kobject, which potentially leads to memory leak.
This patch fixes the issue by calling kobject\_put() even if
kobject\_init\_and\_add() fails.

KVM: arm64: Make vcpu\_cp1x() work on Big Endian hosts
commit 3204be4109ad681523e3461ce64454c79278450a upstream.
AArch32 CP1x registers are overlayed on their AArch64 counterparts
in the vcpu struct. This leads to an interesting problem as they
are stored in their CPU-local format, and thus a CP1x register
doesn't "hit" the lower 32bit portion of the AArch64 register on
a BE host.
To workaround this unfortunate situation, introduce a bias trick
in the vcpu\_cp1x() accessors which picks the correct half of the
64bit register.

KVM: arm64: Stop writing aarch32's CSSELR into ACTLR
commit 7c582bf4ed84f3eb58bdd1f63024a14c17551e7d upstream.
aarch32 has pairs of registers to access the high and low parts of 64bit
registers. KVM has a union of 64bit sys\_regs[] and 32bit copro[]. The
32bit accessors read the high or low part of the 64bit sys\_reg[] value
through the union.
Both sys\_reg\_descs[] and cp15\_regs[] list access\_csselr() as the accessor
for CSSELR{,\_EL1}. access\_csselr() is only aware of the 64bit sys\_regs[],
and expects r->reg to be 'CSSELR\_EL1' in the enum, index 2 of the 64bit
array.
cp15\_regs[] uses the 32bit copro[] alias of sys\_regs[]. Here CSSELR is
c0\_CSSELR which is the same location in sys\_reg[]. r->reg is 'c0\_CSSELR',
index 4 in the 32bit array.
access\_csselr() uses the 32bit r->reg value to access the 64bit array,
so reads and write the wrong value. sys\_regs[4], is ACTLR\_EL1, which
is subsequently save/restored when we enter the guest.
ACTLR\_EL1 is supposed to be read-only for the guest. This register
only affects execution at EL1, and the host's value is restored before
we return to host EL1.
Convert the 32bit register index back to the 64bit version.

KVM: MIPS: Fix VPN2\_MASK definition for variable cpu\_vmbits
commit 5816c76dea116a458f1932eefe064e35403248eb upstream.
If a CPU support more than 32bit vmbits (which is true for 64bit CPUs),
VPN2\_MASK set to fixed 0xffffe000 will lead to a wrong EntryHi in some
functions such as \_kvm\_mips\_host\_tlb\_inv().
The cpu\_vmbits definition of 32bit CPU in cpu-features.h is 31, so we
still use the old definition.

KVM: nVMX: Consult only the "basic" exit reason when routing nested exit
commit 2ebac8bb3c2d35f5135466490fc8eeaf3f3e2d37 upstream.
Consult only the basic exit reason, i.e. bits 15:0 of vmcs.EXIT\_REASON,
when determining whether a nested VM-Exit should be reflected into L1 or
handled by KVM in L0.
For better or worse, the switch statement in nested\_vmx\_exit\_reflected()
currently defaults to "true", i.e. reflects any nested VM-Exit without
dedicated logic. Because the case statements only contain the basic
exit reason, any VM-Exit with modifier bits set will be reflected to L1,
even if KVM intended to handle it in L0.
Practically speaking, this only affects EXIT\_REASON\_MCE\_DURING\_VMENTRY,
i.e. a #MC that occurs on nested VM-Enter would be incorrectly routed to
L1, as "failed VM-Entry" is the only modifier that KVM can currently
encounter. The SMM modifiers will never be generated as KVM doesn't
support/employ a SMI Transfer Monitor. Ditto for "exit from enclave",
as KVM doesn't yet support virtualizing SGX, i.e. it's impossible to
enter an enclave in a KVM guest (L1 or L2).

KVM: nVMX: Skip IBPB when switching between vmcs01 and vmcs02
commit 5c911beff20aa8639e7a1f28988736c13e03ed54 upstream.
Skip the Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier that is triggered on a VMCS
switch when running with spectre\_v2\_user=on/auto if the switch is
between two VMCSes in the same guest, i.e. between vmcs01 and vmcs02.
The IBPB is intended to prevent one guest from attacking another, which
is unnecessary in the nested case as it's the same guest from KVM's
perspective.
This all but eliminates the overhead observed for nested VMX transitions
when running with CONFIG\_RETPOLINE=y and spectre\_v2\_user=on/auto, which
can be significant, e.g. roughly 3x on current systems.

media: videobuf2-dma-contig: fix bad kfree in vb2\_dma\_contig\_clear\_max\_seg\_size
commit 0d9668721311607353d4861e6c32afeb272813dc upstream.
Commit 9495b7e92f716ab2bd6814fab5e97ab4a39adfdd ("driver core: platform:
Initialize dma\_parms for platform devices") in v5.7-rc5 causes
vb2\_dma\_contig\_clear\_max\_seg\_size() to kfree memory that was not
allocated by vb2\_dma\_contig\_set\_max\_seg\_size().
The assumption in vb2\_dma\_contig\_set\_max\_seg\_size() seems to be that
dev->dma\_parms is always NULL when the driver is probed, and the case
where dev->dma\_parms has bee initialized by someone else than the driver
(by calling vb2\_dma\_contig\_set\_max\_seg\_size) will cause a failure.
All the current users of these functions are platform devices, which now
always have dma\_parms set by the driver core. To fix the issue for v5.7,
make vb2\_dma\_contig\_set\_max\_seg\_size() return an error if dma\_parms is
NULL to be on the safe side, and remove the kfree code from
vb2\_dma\_contig\_clear\_max\_seg\_size().
For v5.8 we should remove the two functions and move the
dma\_set\_max\_seg\_size() calls into the drivers.

commit 18722d48a6bb9c2e8d046214c0a5fd19d0a7c9f6 upstream.
Some memory is vmalloc'ed in the 'w100fb\_save\_vidmem' function and freed in
the 'w100fb\_restore\_vidmem' function. (these functions are called
respectively from the 'suspend' and the 'resume' functions)
However, it is also freed in the 'remove' function.
In order to avoid a potential double free, set the corresponding pointer
to NULL once freed in the 'w100fb\_restore\_vidmem' function.

remoteproc: Fix and restore the parenting hierarchy for vdev
commit c774ad010873bb89dcc0cdcb1e96aef6664d8caf upstream.
The commit 086d08725d34 ("remoteproc: create vdev subdevice with specific
dma memory pool") has introduced a new vdev subdevice for each vdev
declared in the firmware resource table and made it as the parent for the
created virtio rpmsg devices instead of the previous remoteproc device.
This changed the overall parenting hierarchy for the rpmsg devices, which
were children of virtio devices, and does not allow the corresponding
rpmsg drivers to retrieve the parent rproc device through the
rproc\_get\_by\_child() API.
Fix this by restoring the remoteproc device as the parent. The new vdev
subdevice can continue to inherit the DMA attributes from the remoteproc's
parent device (actual platform device).

remoteproc: Fall back to using parent memory pool if no dedicated available
commit db9178a4f8c4e523f824892cb8bab00961b07385 upstream.
In some cases, like with OMAP remoteproc, we are not creating dedicated
memory pool for the virtio device. Instead, we use the same memory pool
for all shared memories. The current virtio memory pool handling forces
a split between these two, as a separate device is created for it,
causing memory to be allocated from bad location if the dedicated pool
is not available. Fix this by falling back to using the parent device
memory pool if dedicated is not available.

proc: Use new\_inode not new\_inode\_pseudo
commit ef1548adada51a2f32ed7faef50aa465e1b4c5da upstream.
Recently syzbot reported that unmounting proc when there is an ongoing
inotify watch on the root directory of proc could result in a use
after free when the watch is removed after the unmount of proc
when the watcher exits.
Commit 69879c01a0c3 ("proc: Remove the now unnecessary internal mount
of proc") made it easier to unmount proc and allowed syzbot to see the
problem, but looking at the code it has been around for a long time.
Looking at the code the fsnotify watch should have been removed by
fsnotify\_sb\_delete in generic\_shutdown\_super. Unfortunately the inode
was allocated with new\_inode\_pseudo instead of new\_inode so the inode
was not on the sb->s\_inodes list. Which prevented
fsnotify\_unmount\_inodes from finding the inode and removing the watch
as well as made it so the "VFS: Busy inodes after unmount" warning
could not find the inodes to warn about them.
Make all of the inodes in proc visible to generic\_shutdown\_super,
and fsnotify\_sb\_delete by using new\_inode instead of new\_inode\_pseudo.
The only functional difference is that new\_inode places the inodes
on the sb->s\_inodes list.
I wrote a small test program and I can verify that without changes it
can trigger this issue, and by replacing new\_inode\_pseudo with
new\_inode the issues goes away.

exfat\_free() should call exfat\_free\_iocharset(), to prevent a leak
in case we fail after parsing iocharset= but before calling

Additionally, there's no point copying param->string in
exfat\_parse\_param() - just steal it, leaving NULL in param->string.
That's independent from the leak or fix thereof - it's simply
avoiding an extra copy.

ovl: initialize error in ovl\_copy\_xattr
commit 520da69d265a91c6536c63851cbb8a53946974f0 upstream.
In ovl\_copy\_xattr, if all the xattrs to be copied are overlayfs private
xattrs, the copy loop will terminate without assigning anything to the
error variable, thus returning an uninitialized value.
If ovl\_copy\_xattr is called from ovl\_clear\_empty, this uninitialized error
value is put into a pointer by ERR\_PTR(), causing potential invalid memory
accesses down the line.
This commit initialize error with 0. This is the correct value because when
there's no xattr to copy, because all xattrs are private, ovl\_copy\_xattr
should succeed.
This bug is discovered with the help of INIT\_STACK\_ALL and clang.

ionic: wait on queue start until after IFF\_UP
[ Upstream commit 976ee3b21119dcf5c6d96233d688a1453f29fa83 ]
The netif\_running() test looks at \_\_LINK\_STATE\_START which
gets set before ndo\_open() is called, there is a window of
time between that and when the queues are actually ready to
be run. If ionic\_check\_link\_status() notices that the link is
up very soon after netif\_running() becomes true, it might try
to run the queues before they are ready, causing all manner of
potential issues. Since the netdev->flags IFF\_UP isn't set
until after ndo\_open() returns, we can wait for that before
we allow ionic\_check\_link\_status() to start the queues.
On the way back to close, \_\_LINK\_STATE\_START is cleared before
calling ndo\_stop(), and IFF\_UP is cleared after. Both of
these need to be true in order to safely stop the queues
from ionic\_check\_link\_status().

net/mlx5: Disable reload while removing the device
[ Upstream commit 60904cd349abc98cb888fc28d1ca55a8e2cf87b3 ]
While unregistration is in progress, user might be reloading the
interface.
This can race with unregistration in below flow which uses the
resources which are getting disabled by reload flow.
Hence, disable the devlink reloading first when removing the device.

net: macb: Only disable NAPI on the actual error path
[ Upstream commit 939a5bf7c9b7a1ad9c5d3481c93766a522773531 ]
A recent change added a disable to NAPI into macb\_open, this was
intended to only happen on the error path but accidentally applies
to all paths. This causes NAPI to be disabled on the success path, which
leads to the network to no longer functioning.

net/mlx5e: Fix repeated XSK usage on one channel
[ Upstream commit 36d45fb9d2fdf348d778bfe73f0427db1c6f9bc7 ]
After an XSK is closed, the relevant structures in the channel are not
zeroed. If an XSK is opened the second time on the same channel without
recreating channels, the stray values in the structures will lead to
incorrect operation of queues, which causes CQE errors, and the new
socket doesn't work at all.
This patch fixes the issue by explicitly zeroing XSK-related structs in
the channel on XSK close. Note that those structs are zeroed on channel
creation, and usually a configuration change (XDP program is set)
happens on XSK open, which leads to recreating channels, so typical XSK
usecases don't suffer from this issue. However, if XSKs are opened and
closed on the same channel without removing the XDP program, this bug
reproduces.

net/mlx5: Fix fatal error handling during device load
[ Upstream commit b6e0b6bebe0732d5cac51f0791f269d2413b8980 ]
Currently, in case of fatal error during mlx5\_load\_one(), we cannot
enter error state until mlx5\_load\_one() is finished, what can take
several minutes until commands will get timeouts, because these commands
can't be processed due to the fatal error.
Fix it by setting dev->state as MLX5\_DEVICE\_STATE\_INTERNAL\_ERROR before
requesting the lock.

[ Upstream commit 42ea9f1b5c625fad225d4ac96a7e757dd4199d9c ]
In case there is a work in the health WQ when we teardown the driver,
in driver load error flow, the health work will try to read dev->iseg,
which was already unmap in mlx5\_pci\_close().
Fix it by draining the health workqueue first thing in mlx5\_pci\_close().

firmware: imx: scu: Fix corruption of header
[ Upstream commit f5f27b79eab80de0287c243a22169e4876b08d5e ]
The header of the message to send can be changed if the
response is longer than the request:
- 1st word, the header is sent
- the remaining words of the message are sent
- the response is received asynchronously during the
execution of the loop, changing the size field in
the header
- the for loop test the termination condition using
the corrupted header
It is the case for the API build\_info which has just a
header as request but 3 words in response.
This issue is fixed storing the header locally instead of
using a pointer on it.

x86/{mce,mm}: Unmap the entire page if the whole page is affected and poisoned
commit 17fae1294ad9d711b2c3dd0edef479d40c76a5e8 upstream.
An interesting thing happened when a guest Linux instance took a machine
check. The VMM unmapped the bad page from guest physical space and
passed the machine check to the guest.
Linux took all the normal actions to offline the page from the process
that was using it. But then guest Linux crashed because it said there
was a second machine check inside the kernel with this stack trace:
do\_memory\_failure
set\_mce\_nospec
set\_memory\_uc
\_set\_memory\_uc
change\_page\_attr\_set\_clr
cpa\_flush
clflush\_cache\_range\_opt
This was odd, because a CLFLUSH instruction shouldn't raise a machine
check (it isn't consuming the data). Further investigation showed that
the VMM had passed in another machine check because is appeared that the
guest was accessing the bad page.
Fix is to check the scope of the poison by checking the MCi\_MISC register.
If the entire page is affected, then unmap the page. If only part of the
page is affected, then mark the page as uncacheable.
This assumes that VMMs will do the logical thing and pass in the "whole
page scope" via the MCi\_MISC register (since they unmapped the entire
page).

crypto: virtio: Fix use-after-free in virtio\_crypto\_skcipher\_finalize\_req()
commit 8c855f0720ff006d75d0a2512c7f6c4f60ff60ee upstream.
The system'll crash when the users insmod crypto/tcrypto.ko with mode=155
( testing "authenc(hmac(sha1),cbc(aes))" ). It's caused by reuse the memory
of request structure.
In crypto\_authenc\_init\_tfm(), the reqsize is set to:
[PART 1] sizeof(authenc\_request\_ctx) +
[PART 2] ictx->reqoff +
[PART 3] MAX(ahash part, skcipher part)
and the 'PART 3' is used by both ahash and skcipher in turn.
When the virtio\_crypto driver finish skcipher req, it'll call ->complete
callback(in crypto\_finalize\_skcipher\_request) and then free its
resources whose pointers are recorded in 'skcipher parts'.
However, the ->complete is 'crypto\_authenc\_encrypt\_done' in this case,
it will use the 'ahash part' of the request and change its content,
so virtio\_crypto driver will get the wrong pointer after ->complete
finish and mistakenly free some other's memory. So the system will crash
when these memory will be used again.
The resources which need to be cleaned up are not used any more. But the
pointers of these resources may be changed in the function
"crypto\_finalize\_skcipher\_request". Thus release specific resources before
calling this function.

crypto: algapi - Avoid spurious modprobe on LOADED
commit beeb460cd12ac9b91640b484b6a52dcba9d9fc8f upstream.
Currently after any algorithm is registered and tested, there's an
unnecessary request\_module("cryptomgr") even if it's already loaded.
Also, CRYPTO\_MSG\_ALG\_LOADED is sent twice, and thus if the algorithm is
"crct10dif", lib/crc-t10dif.c replaces the tfm twice rather than once.
This occurs because CRYPTO\_MSG\_ALG\_LOADED is sent using
crypto\_probing\_notify(), which tries to load "cryptomgr" if the
notification is not handled (NOTIFY\_DONE). This doesn't make sense
because "cryptomgr" doesn't handle this notification.
Fix this by using crypto\_notify() instead of crypto\_probing\_notify().

gup: document and work around "COW can break either way" issue
commit 17839856fd588f4ab6b789f482ed3ffd7c403e1f upstream.
Doing a "get\_user\_pages()" on a copy-on-write page for reading can be
ambiguous: the page can be COW'ed at any time afterwards, and the
direction of a COW event isn't defined.
Yes, whoever writes to it will generally do the COW, but if the thread
that did the get\_user\_pages() unmapped the page before the write (and
that could happen due to memory pressure in addition to any outright
action), the writer could also just take over the old page instead.
End result: the get\_user\_pages() call might result in a page pointer
that is no longer associated with the original VM, and is associated
with - and controlled by - another VM having taken it over instead.
So when doing a get\_user\_pages() on a COW mapping, the only really safe
thing to do would be to break the COW when getting the page, even when
only getting it for reading.
At the same time, some users simply don't even care.
For example, the perf code wants to look up the page not because it
cares about the page, but because the code simply wants to look up the
physical address of the access for informational purposes, and doesn't
really care about races when a page might be unmapped and remapped
elsewhere.
This adds logic to force a COW event by setting FOLL\_WRITE on any
copy-on-write mapping when FOLL\_GET (or FOLL\_PIN) is used to get a page
pointer as a result.
The current semantics end up being:
- \_\_get\_user\_pages\_fast(): no change. If you don't ask for a write,
you won't break COW. You'd better know what you're doing.
- get\_user\_pages\_fast(): the fast-case "look it up in the page tables
without anything getting mmap\_sem" now refuses to follow a read-only
page, since it might need COW breaking. Which happens in the slow
path - the fast path doesn't know if the memory might be COW or not.
- get\_user\_pages() (including the slow-path fallback for gup\_fast()):
for a COW mapping, turn on FOLL\_WRITE for FOLL\_GET/FOLL\_PIN, with
very similar semantics to FOLL\_FORCE.
If it turns out that we want finer granularity (ie "only break COW when
it might actually matter" - things like the zero page are special and
don't need to be broken) we might need to push these semantics deeper
into the lookup fault path. So if people care enough, it's possible
that we might end up adding a new internal FOLL\_BREAK\_COW flag to go
with the internal FOLL\_COW flag we already have for tracking "I had a
COW".
Alternatively, if it turns out that different callers might want to
explicitly control the forced COW break behavior, we might even want to
make such a flag visible to the users of get\_user\_pages() instead of
using the above default semantics.
But for now, this is mostly commentary on the issue (this commit message
being a lot bigger than the patch, and that patch in turn is almost all
comments), with that minimal "enable COW breaking early" logic using the
existing FOLL\_WRITE behavior.
[ It might be worth noting that we've always had this ambiguity, and it
could arguably be seen as a user-space issue.
You only get private COW mappings that could break either way in
situations where user space is doing cooperative things (ie fork()
before an execve() etc), but it \_is\_ surprising and very subtle, and
fork() is supposed to give you independent address spaces.
So let's treat this as a kernel issue and make the semantics of
get\_user\_pages() easier to understand. Note that obviously a true
shared mapping will still get a page that can change under us, so this
does \_not\_ mean that get\_user\_pages() somehow returns any "stable"
page ]

The BCM2835aux SPI driver uses devm\_spi\_register\_master() on bind.
As a consequence, on unbind, \_\_device\_release\_driver() first invokes
bcm2835aux\_spi\_remove() before unregistering the SPI controller via
devres\_release\_all().
This order is incorrect: bcm2835aux\_spi\_remove() turns off the SPI
controller, including its interrupts and clock. The SPI controller
is thus no longer usable.
When the SPI controller is subsequently unregistered, it unbinds all
its slave devices. If their drivers need to access the SPI bus,
e.g. to quiesce their interrupts, unbinding will fail.
As a rule, devm\_spi\_register\_master() must not be used if the
->remove() hook performs teardown steps which shall be performed
after unbinding of slaves.
Fix by using the non-devm variant spi\_register\_master(). Note that the
struct spi\_master as well as the driver-private data are not freed until
after bcm2835aux\_spi\_remove() has finished, so accessing them is safe.

spi: pxa2xx: Fix controller unregister order
commit 32e5b57232c0411e7dea96625c415510430ac079 upstream.
The PXA2xx SPI driver uses devm\_spi\_register\_controller() on bind.
As a consequence, on unbind, \_\_device\_release\_driver() first invokes
pxa2xx\_spi\_remove() before unregistering the SPI controller via
devres\_release\_all().
This order is incorrect: pxa2xx\_spi\_remove() disables the chip,
rendering the SPI bus inaccessible even though the SPI controller is
still registered. When the SPI controller is subsequently unregistered,
it unbinds all its slave devices. Because their drivers cannot access
the SPI bus, e.g. to quiesce interrupts, the slave devices may be left
in an improper state.
As a rule, devm\_spi\_register\_controller() must not be used if the
->remove() hook performs teardown steps which shall be performed after
unregistering the controller and specifically after unbinding of slaves.
Fix by reverting to the non-devm variant of spi\_register\_controller().
An alternative approach would be to use device-managed functions for all
steps in pxa2xx\_spi\_remove(), e.g. by calling devm\_add\_action\_or\_reset()
on probe. However that approach would add more LoC to the driver and

The improper use of devm\_spi\_register\_controller() was introduced in 2013
by commit a807fcd090d6 ("spi: pxa2xx: use devm\_spi\_register\_master()"),
but all earlier versions of the driver going back to 2006 were likewise
broken because they invoked spi\_unregister\_master() at the end of
pxa2xx\_spi\_remove(), rather than at the beginning.

spi: Fix controller unregister order
commit 84855678add8aba927faf76bc2f130a40f94b6f7 upstream.
When an SPI controller unregisters, it unbinds all its slave devices.
For this, their drivers may need to access the SPI bus, e.g. to quiesce
interrupts.
However since commit ffbbdd21329f ("spi: create a message queueing
infrastructure"), spi\_destroy\_queue() is executed before unbinding the
slaves. It sets ctlr->running = false, thereby preventing SPI bus
access and causing unbinding of slave devices to fail.
Fix by unbinding slaves before calling spi\_destroy\_queue().

spi: dw: Fix controller unregister order
commit ca8b19d61e3fce5d2d7790cde27a0b57bcb3f341 upstream.
The Designware SPI driver uses devm\_spi\_register\_controller() on bind.
As a consequence, on unbind, \_\_device\_release\_driver() first invokes
dw\_spi\_remove\_host() before unregistering the SPI controller via
devres\_release\_all().
This order is incorrect: dw\_spi\_remove\_host() shuts down the chip,
rendering the SPI bus inaccessible even though the SPI controller is
still registered. When the SPI controller is subsequently unregistered,
it unbinds all its slave devices. Because their drivers cannot access
the SPI bus, e.g. to quiesce interrupts, the slave devices may be left
in an improper state.
As a rule, devm\_spi\_register\_controller() must not be used if the
->remove() hook performs teardown steps which shall be performed after
unregistering the controller and specifically after unbinding of slaves.
Fix by reverting to the non-devm variant of spi\_register\_controller().
An alternative approach would be to use device-managed functions for all
steps in dw\_spi\_remove\_host(), e.g. by calling devm\_add\_action\_or\_reset()
on probe. However that approach would add more LoC to the driver and
it wouldn't lend itself as well to backporting to stable.

lib/lzo: fix ambiguous encoding bug in lzo-rle
commit b5265c813ce4efbfa2e46fd27cdf9a7f44a35d2e upstream.
In some rare cases, for input data over 32 KB, lzo-rle could encode two
different inputs to the same compressed representation, so that
decompression is then ambiguous (i.e. data may be corrupted - although
zram is not affected because it operates over 4 KB pages).
This modifies the compressor without changing the decompressor or the
bitstream format, such that:
- there is no change to how data produced by the old compressor is
decompressed
- an old decompressor will correctly decode data from the updated
compressor
- performance and compression ratio are not affected
- we avoid introducing a new bitstream format
In testing over 12.8M real-world files totalling 903 GB, three files
were affected by this bug. I also constructed 37M semi-random 64 KB
files totalling 2.27 TB, and saw no affected files. Finally I tested
over files constructed to contain each of the ~1024 possible bad input
sequences; for all of these cases, updated lzo-rle worked correctly.
There is no significant impact to performance or compression ratio.

ACPI: PM: Avoid using power resources if there are none for D0
commit 956ad9d98b73f59e442cc119c98ba1e04e94fe6d upstream.
As recently reported, some platforms provide a list of power
resources for device power state D3hot, through the \_PR3 object,
but they do not provide a list of power resources for device power
state D0.
Among other things, this causes acpi\_device\_get\_power() to return
D3hot as the current state of the device in question if all of the
D3hot power resources are "on", because it sees the power\_resources
flag set and calls acpi\_power\_get\_inferred\_state() which finds that
D3hot is the shallowest power state with all of the associated power
resources turned "on", so that's what it returns. Moreover, that
value takes precedence over the acpi\_dev\_pm\_explicit\_get() return
value, because it means a deeper power state. The device may very
well be in D0 physically at that point, however.
Moreover, the presence of \_PR3 without \_PR0 for a given device
means that only one D3-level power state can be supported by it.
Namely, because there are no power resources to turn "off" when
transitioning the device from D0 into D3cold (which should be
supported since \_PR3 is present), the evaluation of \_PS3 should
be sufficient to put it straight into D3cold, but this means that
the effect of turning "on" the \_PR3 power resources is unclear,
so it is better to avoid doing that altogether. Consequently,
there is no practical way do distinguish D3cold from D3hot for
the device in question and the power states of it can be labeled
so that D3hot is the deepest supported one (and Linux assumes
that putting a device into D3hot via ACPI may cause power to be
removed from it anyway, for legacy reasons).
To work around the problem described above modify the ACPI
enumeration of devices so that power resources are only used
for device power management if the list of D0 power resources
is not empty and make it mart D3cold as supported only if that
is the case and the D3hot list of power resources is not empty
too.

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix inconsistent card PM state after resume
commit 862b2509d157c629dd26d7ac6c6cdbf043d332eb upstream.
When a USB-audio interface gets runtime-suspended via auto-pm feature,
the driver suspends all functionality and increment
chip->num\_suspended\_intf. Later on, when the system gets suspended to
S3, the driver increments chip->num\_suspended\_intf again, skips the
device changes, and sets the card power state to
SNDRV\_CTL\_POWER\_D3hot. In return, when the system gets resumed from
S3, the resume callback decrements chip->num\_suspended\_intf. Since
this refcount is still not zero (it's been runtime-suspended), the
whole resume is skipped. But there is a small pitfall here.
The problem is that the driver doesn't restore the card power state
after this resume call, leaving it as SNDRV\_CTL\_POWER\_D3hot. So,
even after the system resume finishes, the card instance still appears
as if it were system-suspended, and this confuses many ioctl accesses
that are blocked unexpectedly.
In details, we have two issues behind the scene: one is that the card
power state is changed only when the refcount becomes zero, and
another is that the prior auto-suspend check is kept in a boolean
flag. Although the latter problem is almost negligible since the
auto-pm feature is imposed only on the primary interface, but this can
be a potential problem on the devices with multiple interfaces.
This patch addresses those issues by the following:
- Replace chip->autosuspended boolean flag with chip->system\_suspend
counter
- At the first system-suspend, chip->num\_suspended\_intf is recorded to
chip->system\_suspend
- At system-resume, the card power state is restored when the
chip->num\_suspended\_intf refcount reaches to chip->system\_suspend,
i.e. the state returns to the auto-suspended
Also, the patch fixes yet another hidden problem by the code
refactoring along with the fixes above: namely, when some resume
procedure failed, the driver left chip->num\_suspended\_intf that was
already decreased, and it might lead to the refcount unbalance.
In the new code, the refcount decrement is done after the whole resume
procedure, and the problem is avoided as well.

ALSA: fireface: fix configuration error for nominal sampling transfer frequency
commit bbd6aac3ae15bef762af03bf62e35ace5c4292bd upstream.
128000 and 192000 are congruence modulo 32000, thus it's wrong to
distinguish them as multiple of 32000 and 48000 by modulo 32000 at
first.
Additionally, used condition statement to detect quadruple speed can
cause missing bit flag.
Furthermore, counter to ensure the configuration is wrong and it
causes false positive.
This commit fixes the above three bugs.

The commit a3cb39d258ef
("serial: core: Allow detach and attach serial device for console")
changed a bit logic behind lock initialization since for most of the console
driver it's supposed to have lock already initialized even if console is not
enabled. However, it's not the case for Freescale IMX console.
Initialize lock explicitly in the ->probe().
Note, there is still an open question should or shouldn't not this driver
register console properly.

commit ebf57440ec59a36e1fc5fe91e31d66ae0d1662d0 upstream.
Some of tests in xfstests failed with cifsd kernel server since commit
e80ddeb2f70e. cifsd kernel server validates credit charge from client
by calculating it base on max((InputCount + OutputCount) and
(MaxInputResponse + MaxOutputResponse)) according to specification.
MS-SMB2 specification describe credit charge calculation of smb2 ioctl :
If Connection.SupportsMultiCredit is TRUE, the server MUST validate
CreditCharge based on the maximum of (InputCount + OutputCount) and
(MaxInputResponse + MaxOutputResponse), as specified in section 3.3.5.2.5.
If the validation fails, it MUST fail the IOCTL request with
STATUS\_INVALID\_PARAMETER.
This patch add indatalen that can be a non-zero value to calculation of
credit charge in SMB2\_ioctl\_init().

KVM: x86: Fix APIC page invalidation race
commit e649b3f0188f8fd34dd0dde8d43fd3312b902fb2 upstream.
Commit b1394e745b94 ("KVM: x86: fix APIC page invalidation") tried
to fix inappropriate APIC page invalidation by re-introducing arch
specific kvm\_arch\_mmu\_notifier\_invalidate\_range() and calling it from
kvm\_mmu\_notifier\_invalidate\_range\_start. However, the patch left a
possible race where the VMCS APIC address cache is updated \*before\*
it is unmapped:
(Invalidator) kvm\_mmu\_notifier\_invalidate\_range\_start()
(Invalidator) kvm\_make\_all\_cpus\_request(kvm, KVM\_REQ\_APIC\_PAGE\_RELOAD)
(KVM VCPU) vcpu\_enter\_guest()
(KVM VCPU) kvm\_vcpu\_reload\_apic\_access\_page()
(Invalidator) actually unmap page
Because of the above race, there can be a mismatch between the
host physical address stored in the APIC\_ACCESS\_PAGE VMCS field and
the host physical address stored in the EPT entry for the APIC GPA
(0xfee0000). When this happens, the processor will not trap APIC
accesses, and will instead show the raw contents of the APIC-access page.
Because Windows OS periodically checks for unexpected modifications to
the LAPIC register, this will show up as a BSOD crash with BugCheck
CRITICAL\_STRUCTURE\_CORRUPTION (109) we are currently seeing in
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1751017.
The root cause of the issue is that kvm\_arch\_mmu\_notifier\_invalidate\_range()
cannot guarantee that no additional references are taken to the pages in
the range before kvm\_mmu\_notifier\_invalidate\_range\_end(). Fortunately,
this case is supported by the MMU notifier API, as documented in
include/linux/mmu\_notifier.h:
\* If the subsystem
\* can't guarantee that no additional references are taken to
\* the pages in the range, it has to implement the
\* invalidate\_range() notifier to remove any references taken
\* after invalidate\_range\_start().
The fix therefore is to reload the APIC-access page field in the VMCS
from kvm\_mmu\_notifier\_invalidate\_range() instead of ...\_range\_start().

KVM: x86: respect singlestep when emulating instruction
commit 384dea1c9183880be183cfaae161d99aafd16df6 upstream.
When userspace configures KVM\_GUESTDBG\_SINGLESTEP, KVM will manage the
presence of X86\_EFLAGS\_TF via kvm\_set/get\_rflags on vcpus. The actual
rflag bit is therefore hidden from callers.
That includes init\_emulate\_ctxt() which uses the value returned from
kvm\_get\_flags() to set ctxt->tf. As a result, x86\_emulate\_instruction()
will skip a single step, leaving singlestep\_rip stale and not returning
to userspace.
This resolves the issue by observing the vcpu guest\_debug configuration
alongside ctxt->tf in x86\_emulate\_instruction(), performing the single
step if set.

x86/vdso: Unbreak paravirt VDSO clocks
commit 7778d8417b74aded842eeb372961cfc460417fa0 upstream.
The conversion of x86 VDSO to the generic clock mode storage broke the
paravirt and hyperv clocksource logic. These clock sources have their own
internal sequence counter to validate the clocksource at the point of
reading it. This is necessary because the hypervisor can invalidate the
clocksource asynchronously so a check during the VDSO data update is not
sufficient. If the internal check during read invalidates the clocksource
the read return U64\_MAX. The original code checked this efficiently by
testing whether the result (casted to signed) is negative, i.e. bit 63 is
set. This was done that way because an extra indicator for the validity had
more overhead.
The conversion broke this check because the check was replaced by a check
for a valid VDSO clock mode.
The wreckage manifests itself when the paravirt clock is installed as a
valid VDSO clock and during runtime invalidated by the hypervisor,
e.g. after a host suspend/resume cycle. After the invalidation the read
function returns U64\_MAX which is used as cycles and makes the clock jump
by ~2200 seconds, and become stale until the 2200 seconds have elapsed
where it starts to jump again. The period of this effect depends on the
shift/mult pair of the clocksource and the jumps and staleness are an
artifact of undefined but reproducible behaviour of math overflow.
Implement an x86 version of the new vdso\_cycles\_ok() inline which adds this

x86/speculation: PR\_SPEC\_FORCE\_DISABLE enforcement for indirect branches.
commit 4d8df8cbb9156b0a0ab3f802b80cb5db57acc0bf upstream.
Currently, it is possible to enable indirect branch speculation even after
it was force-disabled using the PR\_SPEC\_FORCE\_DISABLE option. Moreover, the
PR\_GET\_SPECULATION\_CTRL command gives afterwards an incorrect result
(force-disabled when it is in fact enabled). This also is inconsistent
vs. STIBP and the documention which cleary states that
PR\_SPEC\_FORCE\_DISABLE cannot be undone.
Fix this by actually enforcing force-disabled indirect branch
speculation. PR\_SPEC\_ENABLE called after PR\_SPEC\_FORCE\_DISABLE now fails
with -EPERM as described in the documentation.

x86/speculation: Avoid force-disabling IBPB based on STIBP and enhanced IBRS.
commit 21998a351512eba4ed5969006f0c55882d995ada upstream.
When STIBP is unavailable or enhanced IBRS is available, Linux
force-disables the IBPB mitigation of Spectre-BTB even when simultaneous
multithreading is disabled. While attempts to enable IBPB using
prctl(PR\_SET\_SPECULATION\_CTRL, PR\_SPEC\_INDIRECT\_BRANCH, ...) fail with
EPERM, the seccomp syscall (or its prctl(PR\_SET\_SECCOMP, ...) equivalent)
which are used e.g. by Chromium or OpenSSH succeed with no errors but the
application remains silently vulnerable to cross-process Spectre v2 attacks
(classical BTB poisoning). At the same time the SYSFS reporting
(/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre\_v2) displays that IBPB is
conditionally enabled when in fact it is unconditionally disabled.
STIBP is useful only when SMT is enabled. When SMT is disabled and STIBP is
unavailable, it makes no sense to force-disable also IBPB, because IBPB
protects against cross-process Spectre-BTB attacks regardless of the SMT
state. At the same time since missing STIBP was only observed on AMD CPUs,
AMD does not recommend using STIBP, but recommends using IBPB, so disabling
IBPB because of missing STIBP goes directly against AMD's advice:
https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/Architecture\_Guidelines\_Update\_Indirect\_Branch\_Control.pdf
Similarly, enhanced IBRS is designed to protect cross-core BTB poisoning
and BTB-poisoning attacks from user space against kernel (and
BTB-poisoning attacks from guest against hypervisor), it is not designed
to prevent cross-process (or cross-VM) BTB poisoning between processes (or
VMs) running on the same core. Therefore, even with enhanced IBRS it is
necessary to flush the BTB during context-switches, so there is no reason
to force disable IBPB when enhanced IBRS is available.
Enable the prctl control of IBPB even when STIBP is unavailable or enhanced
IBRS is available.

x86/speculation: Prevent rogue cross-process SSBD shutdown
commit dbbe2ad02e9df26e372f38cc3e70dab9222c832e upstream.
On context switch the change of TIF\_SSBD and TIF\_SPEC\_IB are evaluated
to adjust the mitigations accordingly. This is optimized to avoid the
expensive MSR write if not needed.
This optimization is buggy and allows an attacker to shutdown the SSBD
protection of a victim process.
The update logic reads the cached base value for the speculation control
MSR which has neither the SSBD nor the STIBP bit set. It then OR's the
SSBD bit only when TIF\_SSBD is different and requests the MSR update.
That means if TIF\_SSBD of the previous and next task are the same, then
the base value is not updated, even if TIF\_SSBD is set. The MSR write is
not requested.
Subsequently if the TIF\_STIBP bit differs then the STIBP bit is updated
in the base value and the MSR is written with a wrong SSBD value.
This was introduced when the per task/process conditional STIPB
switching was added on top of the existing SSBD switching.
It is exploitable if the attacker creates a process which enforces SSBD
and has the contrary value of STIBP than the victim process (i.e. if the
victim process enforces STIBP, the attacker process must not enforce it;
if the victim process does not enforce STIBP, the attacker process must
enforce it) and schedule it on the same core as the victim process. If
the victim runs after the attacker the victim becomes vulnerable to
Spectre V4.
To fix this, update the MSR value independent of the TIF\_SSBD difference
and dependent on the SSBD mitigation method available. This ensures that
a subsequent STIPB initiated MSR write has the correct state of SSBD.

x86: mm: ptdump: calculate effective permissions correctly
commit 1494e0c38ee903e83aefb58caf54a9217273d49a upstream.
Patch series "Fix W+X debug feature on x86"
Jan alerted me[1] that the W+X detection debug feature was broken in x86
by my change[2] to switch x86 to use the generic ptdump infrastructure.
Fundamentally the approach of trying to move the calculation of
effective permissions into note\_page() was broken because note\_page() is
only called for 'leaf' entries and the effective permissions are passed
down via the internal nodes of the page tree. The solution I've taken
here is to create a new (optional) callback which is called for all
nodes of the page tree and therefore can calculate the effective
permissions.
Secondly on some configurations (32 bit with PAE) "unsigned long" is not
large enough to store the table entries. The fix here is simple - let's
just use a u64.

[2] 2ae27137b2db ("x86: mm: convert dump\_pagetables to use walk\_page\_range")
This patch (of 2):
By switching the x86 page table dump code to use the generic code the
effective permissions are no longer calculated correctly because the
note\_page() function is only called for \*leaf\* entries. To calculate
the actual effective permissions it is necessary to observe the full
hierarchy of the page tree.
Introduce a new callback for ptdump which is called for every entry and
can therefore update the prot\_levels array correctly. note\_page() can
then simply access the appropriate element in the array.

x86\_64: Fix jiffies ODR violation
commit d8ad6d39c35d2b44b3d48b787df7f3359381dcbf upstream.
'jiffies' and 'jiffies\_64' are meant to alias (two different symbols that
share the same address). Most architectures make the symbols alias to the
same address via a linker script assignment in their
arch//kernel/vmlinux.lds.S:
jiffies = jiffies\_64;
which is effectively a definition of jiffies.
jiffies and jiffies\_64 are both forward declared for all architectures in
include/linux/jiffies.h. jiffies\_64 is defined in kernel/time/timer.c.
x86\_64 was peculiar in that it wasn't doing the above linker script
assignment, but rather was:
1. defining jiffies in arch/x86/kernel/time.c instead via the linker script.
2. overriding the symbol jiffies\_64 from kernel/time/timer.c in
arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds.s via 'jiffies\_64 = jiffies;'.
As Fangrui notes:
In LLD, symbol assignments in linker scripts override definitions in
object files. GNU ld appears to have the same behavior. It would
probably make sense for LLD to error "duplicate symbol" but GNU ld
is unlikely to adopt for compatibility reasons.
This results in an ODR violation (UB), which seems to have survived
thus far. Where it becomes harmful is when;
1. -fno-semantic-interposition is used:
As Fangrui notes:
Clang after LLVM commit 5b22bcc2b70d
("[X86][ELF] Prefer to lower MC\_GlobalAddress operands to .Lfoo$local")
defaults to -fno-semantic-interposition similar semantics which help
-fpic/-fPIC code avoid GOT/PLT when the referenced symbol is defined
within the same translation unit. Unlike GCC
-fno-semantic-interposition, Clang emits such relocations referencing
local symbols for non-pic code as well.
This causes references to jiffies to refer to '.Ljiffies$local' when
jiffies is defined in the same translation unit. Likewise, references to
jiffies\_64 become references to '.Ljiffies\_64$local' in translation units
that define jiffies\_64. Because these differ from the names used in the
linker script, they will not be rewritten to alias one another.
2. Full LTO
Full LTO effectively treats all source files as one translation
unit, causing these local references to be produced everywhere. When
the linker processes the linker script, there are no longer any
references to jiffies\_64' anywhere to replace with 'jiffies'. And
thus '.Ljiffies$local' and '.Ljiffies\_64$local' no longer alias
at all.
In the process of porting patches enabling Full LTO from arm64 to x86\_64,
spooky bugs have been observed where the kernel appeared to boot, but init
doesn't get scheduled.
Avoid the ODR violation by matching other architectures and define jiffies
only by linker script. For -fno-semantic-interposition + Full LTO, there
is no longer a global definition of jiffies for the compiler to produce a
local symbol which the linker script won't ensure aliases to jiffies\_64.

usercopy: mark dma-kmalloc caches as usercopy caches
commit 49f2d2419d60a103752e5fbaf158cf8d07c0d884 upstream.
We have seen a "usercopy: Kernel memory overwrite attempt detected to
SLUB object 'dma-kmalloc-1 k' (offset 0, size 11)!" error on s390x, as
IUCV uses kmalloc() with \_\_GFP\_DMA because of memory address
restrictions. The issue has been discussed [2] and it has been noted
that if all the kmalloc caches are marked as usercopy, there's little
reason not to mark dma-kmalloc caches too. The 'dma' part merely means
that \_\_GFP\_DMA is used to restrict memory address range.
As Jann Horn put it [3]:
"I think dma-kmalloc slabs should be handled the same way as normal
kmalloc slabs. When a dma-kmalloc allocation is freshly created, it is
just normal kernel memory - even if it might later be used for DMA -,
and it should be perfectly fine to copy\_from\_user() into such
allocations at that point, and to copy\_to\_user() out of them at the
end. If you look at the places where such allocations are created, you
can see things like kmemdup(), memcpy() and so on - all normal
operations that shouldn't conceptually be different from usercopy in
any relevant way."
Thus this patch marks the dma-kmalloc-\* caches as usercopy.

aio: fix async fsync creds
commit 530f32fc370fd1431ea9802dbc53ab5601dfccdb upstream.
Avi Kivity reports that on fuse filesystems running in a user namespace
asyncronous fsync fails with EOVERFLOW.
The reason is that f\_ops->fsync() is called with the creds of the kthread
performing aio work instead of the creds of the process originally
submitting IOCB\_CMD\_FSYNC.
Fuse sends the creds of the caller in the request header and it needs to
translate the uid and gid into the server's user namespace. Since the
kthread is running in init\_user\_ns, the translation will fail and the
operation returns an error.
It can be argued that fsync doesn't actually need any creds, but just
zeroing out those fields in the header (as with requests that currently
don't take creds) is a backward compatibility risk.
Instead of working around this issue in fuse, solve the core of the problem
by calling the filesystem with the proper creds.

KVM: x86: only do L1TF workaround on affected processors
commit d43e2675e96fc6ae1a633b6a69d296394448cc32 upstream.
KVM stores the gfn in MMIO SPTEs as a caching optimization. These are split
in two parts, as in "[high 11111 low]", to thwart any attempt to use these bits
in an L1TF attack. This works as long as there are 5 free bits between
MAXPHYADDR and bit 50 (inclusive), leaving bit 51 free so that the MMIO
access triggers a reserved-bit-set page fault.
The bit positions however were computed wrongly for AMD processors that have
encryption support. In this case, x86\_phys\_bits is reduced (for example
from 48 to 43, to account for the C bit at position 47 and four bits used
internally to store the SEV ASID and other stuff) while x86\_cache\_bits in
would remain set to 48, and \_all\_ bits between the reduced MAXPHYADDR
and bit 51 are set. Then low\_phys\_bits would also cover some of the
bits that are set in the shadow\_mmio\_value, terribly confusing the gfn
caching mechanism.
To fix this, avoid splitting gfns as long as the processor does not have
the L1TF bug (which includes all AMD processors). When there is no
splitting, low\_phys\_bits can be set to the reduced MAXPHYADDR removing
the overlap. This fixes "npt=0" operation on EPYC processors.
Thanks to Maxim Levitsky for bisecting this bug.

spi: dw: Fix native CS being unset
[ Upstream commit 9aea644ca17b94f82ad7fa767cbc4509642f4420 ]
Commit 6e0a32d6f376 ("spi: dw: Fix default polarity of native
chipselect") attempted to fix the problem when GPIO active-high
chip-select is utilized to communicate with some SPI slave. It fixed
the problem, but broke the normal native CS support. At the same time
the reversion commit ada9e3fcc175 ("spi: dw: Correct handling of native
chipselect") didn't solve the problem either, since it just inverted
the set\_cs() polarity perception without taking into account that
CS-high might be applicable. Here is what is done to finally fix the
problem.
DW SPI controller demands any native CS being set in order to proceed
with data transfer. So in order to activate the SPI communications we
must set any bit in the Slave Select DW SPI controller register no
matter whether the platform requests the GPIO- or native CS. Preferably
it should be the bit corresponding to the SPI slave CS number. But
currently the dw\_spi\_set\_cs() method activates the chip-select
only if the second argument is false. Since the second argument of the
set\_cs callback is expected to be a boolean with "is-high" semantics
(actual chip-select pin state value), the bit in the DW SPI Slave
Select register will be set only if SPI core requests the driver
to set the CS in the low state. So this will work for active-low
GPIO-based CS case, and won't work for active-high CS setting
the bit when SPI core actually needs to deactivate the CS.
This commit fixes the problem for all described cases. So no matter
whether an SPI slave needs GPIO- or native-based CS with active-high
or low signal the corresponding bit will be set in SER.

powerpc/xive: Clear the page tables for the ESB IO mapping
[ Upstream commit a101950fcb78b0ba20cd487be6627dea58d55c2b ]
Commit 1ca3dec2b2df ("powerpc/xive: Prevent page fault issues in the
machine crash handler") fixed an issue in the FW assisted dump of
machines using hash MMU and the XIVE interrupt mode under the POWER
hypervisor. It forced the mapping of the ESB page of interrupts being
mapped in the Linux IRQ number space to make sure the 'crash kexec'
sequence worked during such an event. But it didn't handle the
un-mapping.
This mapping is now blocking the removal of a passthrough IO adapter
under the POWER hypervisor because it expects the guest OS to have
cleared all page table entries related to the adapter. If some are
still present, the RTAS call which isolates the PCI slot returns error
9001 "valid outstanding translations".
Remove these mapping in the IRQ data cleanup routine.
Under KVM, this cleanup is not required because the ESB pages for the
adapter interrupts are un-mapped from the guest by the hypervisor in
the KVM XIVE native device. This is now redundant but it's harmless.

fanotify: fix ignore mask logic for events on child and on dir
[ Upstream commit 2f02fd3fa13e51713b630164f8a8e5b42de8283b ]
The comments in fanotify\_group\_event\_mask() say:
"If the event is on dir/child and this mark doesn't care about
events on dir/child, don't send it!"
Specifically, mount and filesystem marks do not care about events
on child, but they can still specify an ignore mask for those events.
For example, a group that has:
- A mount mark with mask 0 and ignore\_mask FAN\_OPEN
- An inode mark on a directory with mask FAN\_OPEN | FAN\_OPEN\_EXEC
with flag FAN\_EVENT\_ON\_CHILD
A child file open for exec would be reported to group with the FAN\_OPEN
event despite the fact that FAN\_OPEN is in ignore mask of mount mark,
because the mark iteration loop skips over non-inode marks for events
on child when calculating the ignore mask.
Move ignore mask calculation to the top of the iteration loop block
before excluding marks for events on dir/child.

driver core: Update device link status correctly for SYNC\_STATE\_ONLY links
[ Upstream commit 8c3e315d4296421cd26b3300ee0ac117f0877f20 ]
When SYNC\_STATE\_ONLY support was added in commit 05ef983e0d65 ("driver
core: Add device link support for SYNC\_STATE\_ONLY flag"),
SYNC\_STATE\_ONLY links were treated similar to STATELESS links in terms
of not blocking consumer probe if the supplier hasn't probed yet.
That caused a SYNC\_STATE\_ONLY device link's status to not get updated.
Since SYNC\_STATE\_ONLY device link is no longer useful once the
consumer probes, commit 21c27f06587d ("driver core: Fix
SYNC\_STATE\_ONLY device link implementation") addresses the status
update issue by deleting the SYNC\_STATE\_ONLY device link instead of
complicating the status update code.
However, there are still some cases where we need to update the status
of a SYNC\_STATE\_ONLY device link. This is because a SYNC\_STATE\_ONLY
device link can later get converted into a normal MANAGED device link
when a normal MANAGED device link is created between a supplier and
consumer that already have a SYNC\_STATE\_ONLY device link between them.
If a SYNC\_STATE\_ONLY device link's status isn't maintained correctly
till it's converted to a normal MANAGED device link, then the normal
MANAGED device link will end up with a wrong link status. This can cause
a warning stack trace[1] when the consumer device probes successfully.
This commit fixes the SYNC\_STATE\_ONLY device link status update issue
where it wouldn't transition correctly from DL\_STATE\_DORMANT or
DL\_STATE\_AVAILABLE to DL\_STATE\_CONSUMER\_PROBE. It also resets the status
back to DL\_STATE\_DORMANT or DL\_STATE\_AVAILABLE if the consumer probe
fails.

perf probe: Accept the instance number of kretprobe event

Since the commit 6a13a0d7b4d1 ("ftrace/kprobe: Show the maxactive number

events, the length of the 1st format of the kprobe event will not 1, but
it can be longer. This caused a parser error in perf-probe.
Skip the length check the 1st format of the kprobe event to accept this

# perf probe -a vfs\_read%return
Added new event:
probe:vfs\_read\_\_return (on vfs\_read%return)
You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:
perf record -e probe:vfs\_read\_\_return -aR sleep 1
# perf probe -l
Semantic error :Failed to parse event name: r16:probe/vfs\_read\_\_return
Error: Failed to show event list.

mm: add kvfree\_sensitive() for freeing sensitive data objects

For kvmalloc'ed data object that contains sensitive information like
cryptographic keys, we need to make sure that the buffer is always cleared
before freeing it. Using memset() alone for buffer clearing may not
provide certainty as the compiler may compile it away. To be sure, the
special memzero\_explicit() has to be used.
This patch introduces a new kvfree\_sensitive() for freeing those sensitive
data objects allocated by kvmalloc(). The relevant places where
kvfree\_sensitive() can be used are modified to use it.

staging: mt7621-pci: properly power off dual-ported pcie phy
[ Upstream commit 5fcded5e857cf66c9592e4be28c4dab4520c9177 ]
Pcie phy for pcie0 and pcie1 is shared using a dual ported
one. Current code was assuming that if nothing is connected
in pcie0 it won't be also nothing connected in pcie1. This
assumtion is wrong for some devices such us 'Mikrotik rbm33g'
and 'ZyXEL LTE3301-PLUS' where only connecting a card to the
second bus on the phy is possible. For such devices kernel
hangs in the same point because of the wrong poweroff of the
phy getting the following trace:
mt7621-pci-phy 1e149000.pcie-phy: PHY for 0xbe149000 (dual port = 1)
mt7621-pci-phy 1e14a000.pcie-phy: PHY for 0xbe14a000 (dual port = 0)
mt7621-pci-phy 1e149000.pcie-phy: Xtal is 40MHz
mt7621-pci-phy 1e14a000.pcie-phy: Xtal is 40MHz
mt7621-pci 1e140000.pcie: pcie0 no card, disable it (RST & CLK)
[hangs]
The wrong assumption is located in the 'mt7621\_pcie\_init\_ports'
function where we are just making a power off of the phy for
slots 0 and 2 if nothing is connected in them. Hence, only
poweroff the phy if nothing is connected in both slot 0 and
slot 1 avoiding the kernel to hang.

elfnote: mark all .note sections SHF\_ALLOC
commit 51da9dfb7f20911ae4e79e9b412a9c2d4c373d4b upstream.
ELFNOTE\_START allows callers to specify flags for .pushsection assembler
directives. All callsites but ELF\_NOTE use "a" for SHF\_ALLOC. For vdso's
that explicitly use ELF\_NOTE\_START and BUILD\_SALT, the same section is
specified twice after preprocessing, once with "a" flag, once without.
Example:
.pushsection .note.Linux, "a", @note ;
.pushsection .note.Linux, "", @note ;
While GNU as allows this ordering, it warns for the opposite ordering,
making these directives position dependent. We'd prefer not to precisely
match this behavior in Clang's integrated assembler. Instead, the non
\_\_ASSEMBLY\_\_ definition of ELF\_NOTE uses
\_\_attribute\_\_((section(".note.Linux"))) which is created with SHF\_ALLOC,
so let's make the \_\_ASSEMBLY\_\_ definition of ELF\_NOTE consistent with C
and just always use "a" flag.
This allows Clang to assemble a working mainline (5.6) kernel via:

This bug was bisected to commit 0a3e060f340d ("tipc: add test for Nagle
algorithm effectiveness"). However, it is not the case, the trouble was
from the base in the case of zero data length message sending, we would
unexpectedly make an empty 'txq' queue after the 'tipc\_msg\_append()' in
Nagle mode.
A similar crash can be generated even without the bisected patch but at
the link layer when it accesses the empty queue.
We solve the issues by building at least one buffer to go with socket's
header and an optional data section that may be empty like what we had
with the 'tipc\_msg\_build()'.
Note: the previous commit 4c21daae3dbc ("tipc: Fix NULL pointer
dereference in \_\_tipc\_sendstream()") is obsoleted by this one since the
'txq' will be never empty and the check of 'skb != NULL' is unnecessary

net: dsa: qca8k: Fix "Unexpected gfp" kernel exception
[ Upstream commit 67122a7910bf2135dc7f7ececfcf16a5bdb362c1 ]
Commit 7e99e3470172 ("net: dsa: remove dsa\_switch\_alloc helper")
replaced the dsa\_switch\_alloc helper by devm\_kzalloc in all DSA
drivers. Unfortunately it introduced a typo in qca8k.c driver and
wrong argument is passed to the devm\_kzalloc function.
This fix mitigates the following kernel exception:

genetlink: fix memory leaks in genl\_family\_rcv\_msg\_dumpit()
[ Upstream commit c36f05559104b66bcd7f617e931e38c680227b74 ]
There are two kinds of memory leaks in genl\_family\_rcv\_msg\_dumpit():
1. Before we call ops->start(), whenever an error happens, we forget
to free the memory allocated in genl\_family\_rcv\_msg\_dumpit().
2. When ops->start() fails, the 'info' has been already installed on
the per socket control block, so we should not free it here. More
importantly, nlk->cb\_running is still false at this point, so
netlink\_sock\_destruct() cannot free it either.
The first kind of memory leaks is easier to resolve, but the second
one requires some deeper thoughts.
After reviewing how netfilter handles this, the most elegant solution
I find is just to use a similar way to allocate the memory, that is,
moving memory allocations from caller into ops->start(). With this,
we can solve both kinds of memory leaks: for 1), no memory allocation
happens before ops->start(); for 2), ops->start() handles its own
failures and 'info' is installed to the socket control block only
when success. The only ugliness here is we have to pass all local
variables on stack via a struct, but this is not hard to understand.
Alternatively, we can introduce a ops->free() to solve this too,
but it is overkill as only genetlink has this problem so far.

net: ena: xdp: update napi budget for DROP and ABORTED
[ Upstream commit 3921a81c31df6057183aeb7f7d204003bf699d6f ]
This patch fixes two issues with XDP:
1. If the XDP verdict is XDP\_ABORTED we break the loop, which results in
us handling one buffer per napi cycle instead of the total budget
(usually 64). To overcome this simply change the xdp\_verdict check to
!= XDP\_PASS. When the verdict is XDP\_PASS, the skb is not expected to
be NULL.
2. Update the residual budget for XDP\_DROP and XDP\_ABORTED, since
packets are handled in these cases.

When proxy mode is enabled the vxlan device might reply to Neighbor
Solicitation (NS) messages on behalf of remote hosts.
In case the NS message includes the "Source link-layer address" option
[1], the vxlan device will use the specified address as the link-layer
destination address in its reply.
To avoid an infinite loop, break out of the options parsing loop when
encountering an option with length zero and disregard the NS message.
This is consistent with the IPv6 ndisc code and RFC 4886 which states
that "Nodes MUST silently discard an ND packet that contains an option

tun: correct header offsets in napi frags mode
[ Upstream commit 96aa1b22bd6bb9fccf62f6261f390ed6f3e7967f ]
Tun in IFF\_NAPI\_FRAGS mode calls napi\_gro\_frags. Unlike netif\_rx and
netif\_gro\_receive, this expects skb->data to point to the mac layer.
But skb\_probe\_transport\_header, \_\_skb\_get\_hash\_symmetric, and
xdp\_do\_generic in tun\_get\_user need skb->data to point to the network
header. Flow dissection also needs skb->protocol set, so
eth\_type\_trans has to be called.
Ensure the link layer header lies in linear as eth\_type\_trans pulls
ETH\_HLEN. Then take the same code paths for frags as for not frags.
Push the link layer header back just before calling napi\_gro\_frags.
By pulling up to ETH\_HLEN from frag0 into linear, this disables the
frag0 optimization in the special case when IFF\_NAPI\_FRAGS is used
with zero length iov[0] (and thus empty skb->linear).

mlxsw: core: Use different get\_trend() callbacks for different thermal zones
[ Upstream commit 2dc2f760052da4925482ecdcdc5c94d4a599153c ]
The driver registers three different types of thermal zones: For the
ASIC itself, for port modules and for gearboxes.
Currently, all three types use the same get\_trend() callback which does
not work correctly for the ASIC thermal zone. The callback assumes that
the device data is of type 'struct mlxsw\_thermal\_module', whereas for
the ASIC thermal zone 'struct mlxsw\_thermal' is passed as device data.
Fix this by using one get\_trend() callback for the ASIC thermal zone and
another for the other two types.

ipv6: fix IPV6\_ADDRFORM operation logic
[ Upstream commit 79a1f0ccdbb4ad700590f61b00525b390cb53905 ]
Socket option IPV6\_ADDRFORM supports UDP/UDPLITE and TCP at present.
Previously the checking logic looks like:
if (sk->sk\_protocol == IPPROTO\_UDP || sk->sk\_protocol == IPPROTO\_UDPLITE)
do\_some\_check;
else if (sk->sk\_protocol != IPPROTO\_TCP)
break;
After commit b6f6118901d1 ("ipv6: restrict IPV6\_ADDRFORM operation"), TCP
was blocked as the logic changed to:
if (sk->sk\_protocol == IPPROTO\_UDP || sk->sk\_protocol == IPPROTO\_UDPLITE)
do\_some\_check;
else if (sk->sk\_protocol == IPPROTO\_TCP)
do\_some\_check;
break;
else
break;
Then after commit 82c9ae440857 ("ipv6: fix restrict IPV6\_ADDRFORM operation")
UDP/UDPLITE were blocked as the logic changed to:
if (sk->sk\_protocol == IPPROTO\_UDP || sk->sk\_protocol == IPPROTO\_UDPLITE)
do\_some\_check;
if (sk->sk\_protocol == IPPROTO\_TCP)
do\_some\_check;
if (sk->sk\_protocol != IPPROTO\_TCP)
break;
Fix it by using Eric's code and simply remove the break in TCP check, which
looks like:
if (sk->sk\_protocol == IPPROTO\_UDP || sk->sk\_protocol == IPPROTO\_UDPLITE)
do\_some\_check;
else if (sk->sk\_protocol == IPPROTO\_TCP)
do\_some\_check;
else

Debian Bug     : 988044 989285 990411 994050

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

    This issue was already fixed for most architectures, but not on
    MIPS and System z.  This update corrects that.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

    The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
    implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
    invalid attributes for a file.  A local user permitted to run a
    FUSE server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    The original fix for this introduced a different potential denial
    of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2021-3640

    Lin Ma discovered a race condiiton in the Bluetooth protocol
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3744, CVE-2021-3764

    minihanshen reported bugs in the ccp driver for AMD
    Cryptographic Coprocessors that could lead to a resource leak.
    On systems using this driver, a local user could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-3752

    Likang Luo of NSFOCUS Security Team discovered a flaw in the
    Bluetooth L2CAP implementation that can lead to a user-after-free.
    A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3760, CVE-2021-4202

    Lin Ma discovered race conditions in the NCI (NFC Controller
    Interface) driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-3772

    A flaw was found in the SCTP protocol implementation, which would
    allow a networked attacker to break an SCTP association.  The
    attacker would only need to know or guess the IP addresses and
    ports for the association.

CVE-2021-4002

    It was discovered that hugetlbfs, the virtual filesystem used by
    applications to allocate huge pages in RAM, did not flush the
    CPU's TLB in one case where it was necessary.  In some
    circumstances a local user would be able to read and write huge
    pages after they are freed and reallocated to a different process.
    This could lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or
    information leaks.

CVE-2021-4083

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    garbage collector, that can lead to use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-4135

    A flaw was found in the netdevsim driver which would lead to an
    information leak.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-4155

    Kirill Tkhai discovered a data leak in the way the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP
    IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for a size increase of files
    with unaligned size. A local attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem.

CVE-2021-4203

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to leak sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2021-20317

    It was discovered that the timer queue structure could become
    corrupt, leading to waiting tasks never being woken up.  A local
    user with certain privileges could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (system hang).

CVE-2021-20321

    A race condition was discovered in the overlayfs filesystem

CVE-2021-39713

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling
    subsystem which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-41864

    An integer overflow was discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF)
    subsystem.  A local user could exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-42739

    A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the firedtv driver for
    FireWire-connected DVB receivers.  A local user with access to a
    firedtv device could exploit this for denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43389

    The Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a flaw in the CMTP
    subsystem as used by Bluetooth, which could lead to an
    out-of-bounds read and object type confusion.  A local user with

    of this flaw for denial of service.

CVE-2021-45480

    A memory leak flaw was discovered in the __rds_conn_create()
    function in the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol subsystem.

CVE-2022-0001 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
    Intel processors can be exploited to create information side-
    channels with speculative execution.  This issue is similar to
    Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
    processors.

    This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
    different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
    or from a KVM guest to the kernel.

CVE-2022-0002 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    This is a similar issue to CVE-2022-0001, but covers exploitation
    within a security context, such as from JIT-compiled code in a
    sandbox to hosting code in the same process.

    This can be partly mitigated by disabling eBPF for unprivileged
    users with the sysctl: kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=2.  This
    update does that by default.

CVE-2022-0322

    Eiichi Tsukata discovered a flaw in the sctp_make_strreset_req()
    function in the SCTP network protocol implementation which can
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-0330

    networking module for the Transparent Inter-Process Communication
    (TIPC) protocol, resulting in denial of service or potentially the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-0487

    A use-after-free was discovered in the MOXART SD/MMC Host Controller
    support driver. This flaw does not impact the Debian binary packages
    as CONFIG_MMC_MOXART is not set.

CVE-2022-0492

    Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang reported that the cgroup-v1 subsystem does
    not properly restrict access to the release-agent feature. A local
    user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation and
    bypass of namespace isolation.

CVE-2022-0617

    butt3rflyh4ck discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the UDF
    filesystem. A local user that can mount a specially crafted UDF
    image can use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2022-0644

    Hao Sun reported a missing check for file read permission in the
    finit_module() and kexec_file_load() system calls.  The security
    impact of this is unclear, since these system calls are usually
    only available to the root user.

CVE-2022-22942

    It was discovered that wrong file file descriptor handling in the
    VMware Virtual GPU driver (vmwgfx) could result in information leak
    or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-24448

Debian Bug     : 988044 989285 990411 994050

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

    This issue was already fixed for most architectures, but not on
    MIPS and System z.  This update corrects that.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

    The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
    implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
    invalid attributes for a file.  A local user permitted to run a
    FUSE server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    The original fix for this introduced a different potential denial
    of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2021-3640

    Lin Ma discovered a race condiiton in the Bluetooth protocol
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3744, CVE-2021-3764

    minihanshen reported bugs in the ccp driver for AMD
    Cryptographic Coprocessors that could lead to a resource leak.
    On systems using this driver, a local user could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-3752

    Likang Luo of NSFOCUS Security Team discovered a flaw in the
    Bluetooth L2CAP implementation that can lead to a user-after-free.
    A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3760, CVE-2021-4202

    Lin Ma discovered race conditions in the NCI (NFC Controller
    Interface) driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-3772

    A flaw was found in the SCTP protocol implementation, which would
    allow a networked attacker to break an SCTP association.  The
    attacker would only need to know or guess the IP addresses and
    ports for the association.

CVE-2021-4002

    It was discovered that hugetlbfs, the virtual filesystem used by
    applications to allocate huge pages in RAM, did not flush the
    CPU's TLB in one case where it was necessary.  In some
    circumstances a local user would be able to read and write huge
    pages after they are freed and reallocated to a different process.
    This could lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or
    information leaks.

CVE-2021-4083

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    garbage collector, that can lead to use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-4135

    A flaw was found in the netdevsim driver which would lead to an
    information leak.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-4155

    Kirill Tkhai discovered a data leak in the way the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP
    IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for a size increase of files
    with unaligned size. A local attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem.

CVE-2021-4203

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to leak sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2021-20317

    It was discovered that the timer queue structure could become
    corrupt, leading to waiting tasks never being woken up.  A local
    user with certain privileges could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (system hang).

CVE-2021-20321

    A race condition was discovered in the overlayfs filesystem
    driver.  A local user with access to an overlayfs mount and to its
    underlying upper directory could exploit this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-20322

    An information leak was discovered in the IPv4 implementation.  A
    remote attacker could exploit this to quickly discover which UDP
    ports a system is using, making it easier for them to carry out a
    DNS poisoning attack against that system.

CVE-2021-22600

    The syzbot tool found a flaw in the packet socket (AF_PACKET)
    implementation which could lead to incorrectly freeing memory.  A
    local user with CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any user namespace)
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-0322

    Eiichi Tsukata discovered a flaw in the sctp_make_strreset_req()
    function in the SCTP network protocol implementation which can
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-0330

    Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered a missing GPU TLB flush in the
    i915 driver, resulting in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-0435

    Samuel Page and Eric Dumazet reported a stack overflow in the
    networking module for the Transparent Inter-Process Communication
    (TIPC) protocol, resulting in denial of service or potentially the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-0487

    A use-after-free was discovered in the MOXART SD/MMC Host Controller
    support driver. This flaw does not impact the Debian binary packages
    as CONFIG_MMC_MOXART is not set.

CVE-2022-0492

    Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang reported that the cgroup-v1 subsystem does
    not properly restrict access to the release-agent feature. A local
    user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation and
    bypass of namespace isolation.

CVE-2022-0617

    butt3rflyh4ck discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the UDF
    filesystem. A local user that can mount a specially crafted UDF
    image can use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2022-0644

    Hao Sun reported a missing check for file read permission in the
    finit_module() and kexec_file_load() system calls.  The security
    impact of this is unclear, since these system calls are usually
    only available to the root user.

CVE-2022-22942

    It was discovered that wrong file file descriptor handling in the
    VMware Virtual GPU driver (vmwgfx) could result in information leak
    or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-24448

    Lyu Tao reported a flaw in the NFS implementation in the Linux
    kernel when handling requests to open a directory on a regular file,
    which could result in a information leak.

CVE-2022-24959

    A memory leak was discovered in the yam_siocdevprivate() function of
    the YAM driver for AX.25, which could result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-25258

    Szymon Heidrich reported the USB Gadget subsystem lacks certain
    validation of interface OS descriptor requests, resulting in memory
    corruption.

CVE-2022-25375

    Szymon Heidrich reported that the RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation
    of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command, resulting in information
    leak from kernel memory.

                 CVE-2021-33034

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service, or information leaks.

This update is not yet available for the armel (ARM EABI soft-float)
architecture.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly
    of fragmented packets.  In some circumstances, an attacker within
    range of a network could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary
    packets and/or to access sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the "is
    aggregated" packet header flag.  An attacker within range of a
    network could exploit this to forge arbitrary packets on that
    network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

    kiyin (尹亮) of TenCent discovered several reference counting bugs
    in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to use-after-free.
    A local user could exploit these for denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered that
    the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that could
    result in use-after-free and double-free.  This has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

    kiyin (尹亮) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the NFC LLCP
    implementation.  A local user could exploit this for denial of
    service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211.  When operating in AP mode, they would
    forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender
    was not yet authenticated.  An attacker within range of a network
    could use this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting
    other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

    Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
    Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of
    it.  An attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they
    pair using Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the
    shared secret (Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices
    to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

    The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
    implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
    invalid attributes for a file.  A local user permitted to run a
    FUSE server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    The original fix for this introduced a different potential denial
    of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2021-3428

    Wolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the ext4
    filesystem driver. A user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem
    images could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3483

    马哲宇 (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the "nosy" driver for TI
    PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list corruption
    and a use-after-free.  On a system that uses this driver, local
    users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

    The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the
    Bluetooth subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or
    double-free.  A local user could exploit these to caue a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

    Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential null
    pointer dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation.  A local user
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

    It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
    drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
    drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure.  A local
    user on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    for privilege escalation.  The API has been changed to match
    driver expectations.

CVE-2021-23133

    Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the
    SCTP implementation, which can lead to list corruption.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

    It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
    limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker
    within WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a
    vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

    It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930
    (XSA-365) introduced a potential resource leak.  A malicious guest
    could presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (resource exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

    Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which
    can lead to an assertion failure.  On systems using Btrfs, a local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

    Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for
    Intel PEBS.  A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs
    codenamed "Haswell" and earlier could lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  On systems with the affected CPUs, if users are
    permitted to access performance events, a local user may exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users do not have access to performance
    events, which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

    It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler
    for x86_64 generated incorrect branch instructions in some
    cases.  On systems where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could
    exploit this to execute arbitrary code in the kernel.

    By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.  This is
    controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host
    (server) implementation which can lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  On a system acting as a USB/IP host, a client
    can exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

    The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC
    Router (qrtr) implementation.

    This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

    It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem
    could lead to a null pointer dereference during replacement of a
    table.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    namespace could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users cannot create user namespaces,
    which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-30002

    Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
    Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem.  A local user permitted to access
    video devices (by default, any member of the "video" group) could
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

    Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
    device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
    overrun.  However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
    (i.e. root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not
    have any security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

    The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.272-1.  This update additionally includes many more bug fixes from
stable updates 4.9.259-4.9.272 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
