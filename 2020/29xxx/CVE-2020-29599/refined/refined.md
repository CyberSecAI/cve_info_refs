Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29599:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how ImageMagick handles the `-authenticate` option, which is used to set a password for password-protected PDF files. The user-supplied password is not properly escaped or sanitized before being passed to the underlying Ghostscript command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Shell Injection:** The lack of proper escaping allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands by crafting a malicious password string containing shell metacharacters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful attack allows the execution of arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the user running ImageMagick. This can lead to a full compromise of the system.
- **Denial of Service (potentially):** While not the primary impact, the injected command could also lead to a denial of service depending on the attacker's intentions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a crafted image file, specifically a PDF file that requires a password, or MSL file, which sets the `-authenticate` option
- The attacker needs to control the password supplied to the `-authenticate` option. This can be achieved via:
   - Command-line option to `convert`, when a user invokes the ImageMagick `convert` command directly.
   - An MSL (ImageMagick Scripting Language) file, allowing to specify the authenticate option
   -  A polyglot file which uses the SVG parser to trigger the MSL coder

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide the input (image or script) file to ImageMagick and control or influence the `-authenticate` option. This can be achieved in several ways, such as:
   -  A user opening a malicious PDF file with ImageMagick.
   -  An attacker uploading a crafted image file to a website that uses ImageMagick for processing, either directly via command line parameter or via MSL script.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was initially discovered by Alexander Inf√ºhr, and reported to ZDI and the ImageMagick team.
- The fix involves properly sanitizing the user-provided password before passing it to the underlying system call.
- The vulnerability is present in both ImageMagick 6 and 7 before specific versions (6.9.11-40 and 7.0.10-40).
- A mitigation exists by disabling the PDF coder in ImageMagick's policy.xml file.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2020-29599.
- The `system` call is only used in case one of the following characters is present in the sanitized command: &;<>|
