# CVE-2020-29128: XXE in petl < 1.68

## Summary

[petl](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl) is a Python library that provides functions for extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data.

`petl` before 1.68, in some configurations, allows resolution of entities in XML input.

An attacker who is able to submit XML input to an application using `petl` can disclose arbitrary files on the file system in the context of the user under which the application is running.

## Affected Applications

Applications that:

* accept user-supplied XML input that is processed using `petl` < 1.68
* configure `lxml` as the underlying XML processing library used by `petl`

## Impact

Information Disclosure

## Mitigation

* Update to `petl` >= 1.68

## Analysis

The `fromxml` function in the `petl.io.xml` module converts an XML document to a tabular structure using an XML parsing library. `petl` supports using Python's built-in `xml` library or `lxml` for parsing XML. `lxml` is the recommended option.

In `petl` < 1.68, the `fromxml` function creates an `lxml` parser with default settings. By default, `lxml` is configured to resolve local entities.

Example application that would be vulnerable using `petl` < 1.68 with `lxml`:

```
from petl.io.xml import fromxml

petl_table = fromxml('input.xml', 'tr', 'td')

```

To disclose the `/etc/passwd` file running on the application's host, an attacker could supply a crafted XML file like this:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
 <!DOCTYPE foo [
   <!ELEMENT table ANY >
   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
    <table>
    <tr>
        <td>a</td><td>&xxe;</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

```

## Version 1.3.0[¶](#version-1-3-0 "Permalink to this headline")

Note

The parameters to the [`petl.io.xlsx.fromxlsx()`](io.html#petl.io.xlsx.fromxlsx "petl.io.xlsx.fromxlsx") function have changed
in this release. The parameters `row_offset` and `col_offset` are no longer
supported. Please use `min_row`, `min_col`, `max_row` and `max_col` instead.

* A new configuration option failonerror has been added to the [`petl.config`](config.html#module-petl.config "petl.config")
  module. This option affects various transformation functions including
  [`petl.transform.conversions.convert()`](transform.html#petl.transform.conversions.convert "petl.transform.conversions.convert"), [`petl.transform.maps.fieldmap()`](transform.html#petl.transform.maps.fieldmap "petl.transform.maps.fieldmap"),
  [`petl.transform.maps.rowmap()`](transform.html#petl.transform.maps.rowmap "petl.transform.maps.rowmap") and [`petl.transform.maps.rowmapmany()`](transform.html#petl.transform.maps.rowmapmany "petl.transform.maps.rowmapmany").
  The option can have values True (raise any exceptions encountered during conversion),
  False (silently use a given errorvalue if any exceptions arise during conversion) or
  “inline” (use any exceptions as the output value). The default value is False which
  maintains compatibility with previous releases. By [@bmaggard](https://github.com/bmaggard), [#460](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/460),
  [#406](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/406), [#365](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/365).
* A new function [`petl.util.timing.log_progress()`](util.html#petl.util.timing.log_progress "petl.util.timing.log_progress") has been added, which behaves
  in a similar way to [`petl.util.timing.progress()`](util.html#petl.util.timing.progress "petl.util.timing.progress") but writes to a Python logger.
  By [@dusktreader](https://github.com/dusktreader), [#408](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/408), [#407](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/407).

* Added new function [`petl.io.xlsx.appendxlsx()`](io.html#petl.io.xlsx.appendxlsx "petl.io.xlsx.appendxlsx"). By [@victormpa](https://github.com/victormpa) and [@alimanfoo](https://github.com/alimanfoo),
  [#424](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/424), [#475](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/475).
* Fixes for upstream API changes in openpyxl and intervaltree modules. N.B., the arguments
  to [`petl.io.xlsx.fromxlsx()`](io.html#petl.io.xlsx.fromxlsx "petl.io.xlsx.fromxlsx") have changed for specifying row and column offsets
  to match openpyxl. ([#472](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/472) - [@alimanfoo](https://github.com/alimanfoo)).
* Exposed read\_only argument in [`petl.io.xlsx.fromxlsx()`](io.html#petl.io.xlsx.fromxlsx "petl.io.xlsx.fromxlsx") and set default to
  False to prevent truncation of files created by LibreOffice. By [@mbelmadani](https://github.com/mbelmadani),
  [#457](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/457).
* Added support for reading from remote sources with gzip or bz2 compression

  [@dusktreader](https://github.com/dusktreader)).
* Added ability to make constraints optional, i.e., support validation on
  optional fields ([#399](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/399), [#400](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/400) - [@dusktreader](https://github.com/dusktreader)).

  [@PabloCastellano](https://github.com/PabloCastellano)).

## Version 1.1.0[¶](#version-1-1-0 "Permalink to this headline")

* Fixed [`petl.transform.reshape.melt()`](transform.html#petl.transform.reshape.melt "petl.transform.reshape.melt") to work with non-string key
  argument ([#209](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/209)).
* Added example to docstring of [`petl.transform.dedup.conflicts()`](transform.html#petl.transform.dedup.conflicts "petl.transform.dedup.conflicts") to
  illustrate how to analyse the source of conflicts when rows are merged from
  multiple tables
  ([#256](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/256)).
* Added functions for working with bcolz ctables, see [`petl.io.bcolz`](io.html#module-petl.io.bcolz "petl.io.bcolz")
  ([#310](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/310)).
* Added [`petl.io.base.fromcolumns()`](io.html#petl.io.base.fromcolumns "petl.io.base.fromcolumns")
  ([#316](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/316)).
* Added [`petl.transform.reductions.groupselectlast()`](transform.html#petl.transform.reductions.groupselectlast "petl.transform.reductions.groupselectlast").

  alternative to [`petl.transform.basics.cat()`](transform.html#petl.transform.basics.cat "petl.transform.basics.cat"). Also behaviour of
  [`petl.transform.basics.cat()`](transform.html#petl.transform.basics.cat "petl.transform.basics.cat") has changed for tables where the header
  row contains duplicate fields. This was part of addressing a bug in
  [`petl.transform.basics.addfield()`](transform.html#petl.transform.basics.addfield "petl.transform.basics.addfield") for tables where the header

  obtaining two tables, one with rows matching a condition, the other with
  rows not matching the condition
  ([#339](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/339)).
* Changed [`petl.io.json.fromdicts()`](io.html#petl.io.json.fromdicts "petl.io.json.fromdicts") to avoid making two passes through
  the data
  ([#341](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl/issues/341)).

## Version 1.0[¶](#version-1-0 "Permalink to this headline")

Version 1.0 is a new major release of [`petl`](index.html#module-petl "petl"). The main purpose of
version 1.0 is to introduce support for Python 3.4, in addition to the
existing support for Python 2.6 and 2.7. Much of the functionality
available in [`petl`](index.html#module-petl "petl") versions 0.x has remained unchanged in
version 1.0, and most existing code that uses [`petl`](index.html#module-petl "petl") should work
unchanged with version 1.0 or with minor changes. However there have
been a number of API changes, and some functionality has been migrated
from the [petlx](http://petlx.readthedocs.org) package, described below.

If you have any questions about migrating to version 1.0 or find any
problems or issues please email python-etl@googlegroups.com.

### Text file encoding[¶](#text-file-encoding "Permalink to this headline")

Version 1.0 unifies the API for working with ASCII and non-ASCII
encoded text files, including CSV and HTML.

The following functions now accept an ‘encoding’ argument, which
defaults to the value of `locale.getpreferredencoding()` (usually
‘utf-8’): fromcsv, tocsv, appendcsv, teecsv, fromtsv,
totsv, appendtsv, teetsv, fromtext, totext, appendtext,
tohtml, teehtml.

The following functions have been removed as they are now redundant:
fromucsv, toucsv, appenducsv, teeucsv, fromutsv, toutsv,
appendutsv, teeutsv, fromutext, toutext, appendutext,
touhtml, teeuhtml.

To migrate code, in most cases it should be possible to simply replace
‘fromucsv’ with ‘fromcsv’, etc.

### pelt.fluent and petl.interactive[¶](#pelt-fluent-and-petl-interactive "Permalink to this headline")

The functionality previously available through the petl.fluent and
petl.interactive modules is now available through the root petl
module.

This means two things.

First, is is now possible to use either functional or fluent (i.e.,
object-oriented) styles of programming with the root [`petl`](index.html#module-petl "petl")
module, as described in introductory section on
[Functional and object-oriented programming styles](intro.html#intro-programming-styles).

Second, the default representation of table objects uses the
[`petl.util.vis.look()`](util.html#petl.util.vis.look "petl.util.vis.look") function, so you can simply return a table
from the prompt to inspect it, as described in the introductory
section on [Interactive use](intro.html#intro-interactive-use).

The petl.fluent and petl.interactive modules have been removed as
they are now redundant.

To migrate code, it should be possible to simply replace “import
petl.fluent as etl” or “import petl.interactive as etl” with “import
petl as etl”.

Note that the automatic caching behaviour of the petl.interactive
module has **not** been retained. If you want to enable caching
behaviour for a particular table, make an explicit call to the
[`petl.util.materialise.cache()`](util.html#petl.util.materialise.cache "petl.util.materialise.cache") function. See also
[Caching](intro.html#intro-caching).

### IPython notebook integration[¶](#ipython-notebook-integration "Permalink to this headline")

In version 1.0 [`petl`](index.html#module-petl "petl") table container objects implement
\_repr\_html\_() so can be returned from a cell in an IPython notebook
and will automatically format as an HTML table.

Also, the [`petl.util.vis.display()`](util.html#petl.util.vis.display "petl.util.vis.display") and
[`petl.util.vis.displayall()`](util.html#petl.util.vis.displayall "petl.util.vis.displayall") functions have been migrated across
from the petlx.ipython package. If you are working within the
IPython notebook these functions give greater control over how tables
are rendered. For some examples, see:

> <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/petl-developers/petl/blob/v1.0/repr_html.ipynb>

### Database extract/load functions[¶](#database-extract-load-functions "Permalink to this headline")

The [`petl.io.db.todb()`](io.html#petl.io.db.todb "petl.io.db.todb") function now supports automatic table
creation, inferring a schema from data in the table to be loaded. This
functionality has been migrated across from the [petlx](http://petlx.readthedocs.org) package, and
requires [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to be installed.

The functions fromsqlite3, tosqlite3 and appendsqlite3 have been
removed as they duplicate functionality available from the existing
functions [`petl.io.db.fromdb()`](io.html#petl.io.db.fromdb "petl.io.db.fromdb"), [`petl.io.db.todb()`](io.html#petl.io.db.todb "petl.io.db.todb") and
[`petl.io.db.appenddb()`](io.html#petl.io.db.appenddb "petl.io.db.appenddb"). These existing functions have been
modified so that if a string is provided as the dbo argument it is
interpreted as the name of an `sqlite3` file. It should be
possible to migrate code by simply replacing ‘fromsqlite3’ with
‘fromdb’, etc.

### Other functions removed or renamed[¶](#other-functions-removed-or-renamed "Permalink to this headline")

The following functions have been removed because they are overly
complicated and/or hardly ever used. If you use any of these functions
and would like to see them re-instated then please email
python-etl@googlegroups.com: rangefacet, rangerowreduce,
rangeaggregate, rangecounts, multirangeaggregate, lenstats.

The following functions were marked as deprecated in petl 0.x and have
been removed in version 1.0: dataslice (use data instead),
fieldconvert (use convert instead), fieldselect (use select instead),
parsenumber (use numparser instead), recordmap (use rowmap instead),
recordmapmany (use rowmapmany instead), recordreduce (use rowreduce
instead), recordselect (use rowselect instead), valueset (use
`table.values(‘foo’).set()` instead).

The following functions are no longer available in the root
[`petl`](index.html#module-petl "petl") namespace, but are still available from a subpackage if
you really need them: iterdata (use data instead), iterdicts
(use dicts instead), iternamedtuples (use namedtuples instead),
iterrecords (use records instead), itervalues (use values
instead).

The following functions have been renamed: isordered (renamed to
issorted), StringSource (renamed to MemorySource).

The function selectre has been removed as it duplicates
functionality, use search instead.

### Sorting and comparison[¶](#sorting-and-comparison "Permalink to this headline")

A major difference between Python 2 and Python 3 involves comparison
and sorting of objects of different types. Python 3 is a lot stricter
about what you can compare with what, e.g., `None < 1 < 'foo'` works
in Python 2.x but raises an exception in Python 3. The strict
comparison behaviour of Python 3 is generally a problem for typical
usages of [`petl`](index.html#module-petl "petl"), where data can be highly heterogeneous and a
column in a table may have a mixture of values of many different
types, including None for missing.

To maintain the usability of [`petl`](index.html#module-petl "petl") in this type of scenario, and
to ensure that the behaviour of [`petl`](index.html#module-petl "petl") is as consistent as
possible across different Python versions, the
[`petl.transform.sorts.sort()`](transform.html#petl.transform.sorts.sort "petl.transform.sorts.sort") function and anything that depends
on it (as well as any other functions making use of rich comparisons)
emulate the relaxed comparison behaviour that is available under
Python 2.x. In fact [`petl`](index.html#module-petl "petl") goes further than this, allowing
comparison of a wider range of types than is possible under Python 2.x
(e.g., `datetime` with `None`).

As the underlying code to achieve this has been completely reworked,
there may be inconsistencies or unexpected behaviour, so it’s worth
testing carefully the results of any code previously run using
[`petl`](index.html#module-petl "petl") 0.x, especially if you are also migrating from Python 2 to
Python 3.

The different comparison behaviour under different Python versions may
also give unexpected results when selecting rows of a table. E.g., the
following will work under Python 2.x but raise an exception under
Python 3.4:

```
>>> import petl as etl
>>> table = [['foo', 'bar'],
...          ['a', 1],
...          ['b', None]]
>>> # raises exception under Python 3
... etl.select(table, 'bar', lambda v: v > 0)

```

To get the more relaxed behaviour under Python 3.4,
use the [`petl.transform.selects.selectgt`](transform.html#petl.transform.selects.selectgt "petl.transform.selects.selectgt") function, or wrap
values with `petl.comparison.Comparable`, e.g.:

```
>>> # works under Python 3
... etl.selectgt(table, 'bar', 0)
+-----+-----+
| foo | bar |
+=====+=====+
| 'a' |   1 |
+-----+-----+

>>> # or ...
... etl.select(table, 'bar', lambda v: v > etl.Comparable(0))
+-----+-----+
| foo | bar |
+=====+=====+
| 'a' |   1 |
+-----+-----+

```

### New extract/load modules[¶](#new-extract-load-modules "Permalink to this headline")

Several new extract/load modules have been added, migrating
functionality previously available from the [petlx](http://petlx.readthedocs.org) package:

* [Excel .xls files (xlrd/xlwt)](io.html#io-xls)
* [Excel .xlsx files (openpyxl)](io.html#io-xlsx)
* [Arrays (NumPy)](io.html#io-numpy)
* [DataFrames (pandas)](io.html#io-pandas)
* [HDF5 files (PyTables)](io.html#io-pytables)
* [Text indexes (Whoosh)](io.html#io-whoosh)

These modules all have dependencies on third party packages, but these
have been kept as optional dependencies so are not required for
installing [`petl`](index.html#module-petl "petl").

### New validate function[¶](#new-validate-function "Permalink to this headline")

A new [`petl.transform.validation.validate()`](transform.html#petl.transform.validation.validate "petl.transform.validation.validate") function has been
added to provide a convenient interface when validating a table
against a set of constraints.

### New intervals module[¶](#new-intervals-module "Permalink to this headline")

A new module has been added providing transformation functions based
on intervals, migrating functionality previously available from the
[petlx](http://petlx.readthedocs.org) package:

* [Intervals (intervaltree)](transform.html#transform-intervals)

This module requires the [intervaltree](https://github.com/chaimleib/intervaltree) module.

### New configuration module[¶](#new-configuration-module "Permalink to this headline")

All configuration variables have been brought together into a new
[`petl.config`](config.html#module-petl.config "petl.config") module. See the source code for the variables
available, they should be self-explanatory.

### `petl.push` moved to `petlx`[¶](#petl-push-moved-to-petlx "Permalink to this headline")

The `petl.push` module remains in an experimental state and has
been moved to the [petlx](http://petlx.readthedocs.org) extensions project.

### Argument names and other minor changes[¶](#argument-names-and-other-minor-changes "Permalink to this headline")

Argument names for a small number of functions have been changed to
create consistency across the API.

There are some other minor changes as well. If you are migrating from
[`petl`](index.html#module-petl "petl") version 0.x the best thing is to run your code and inspect
any errors. Email python-etl@googlegroups.com if you have any
questions.

### Source code reorganisation[¶](#source-code-reorganisation "Permalink to this headline")

The source code has been substantially reorganised. This should not
affect users of the [`petl`](index.html#module-petl "petl") package however as all functions in
the public API are available through the root [`petl`](index.html#module-petl "petl") namespace.

# CVE-2020-29128: XXE in petl < 1.68

Low

[juarezr](/juarezr)
published
GHSA-f5gc-p5m3-v347
Nov 27, 2020

## Package

petl
(pip, conda)

## Affected versions

< 1.68

## Patched versions

1.68

## Description

### Impact

Information Disclosure

### Summary

[petl](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl) is a Python library that provides functions for extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data.

petl before 1.68, in some configurations, allows resolution of entities in XML input.

An attacker who is able to submit XML input to an application using petl can disclose arbitrary files on the file system in the context of the user under which the application is running.

### Affected Applications

Applications that:

* accept attacker-supplied XML input that is processed using petl < 1.68
* return the response generated by petl back to the attacker
* configure lxml as the underlying XML processing library used by petl
* have read privileges in filesystem files with sensitive information

### Mitigation

Update to petl >= 1.68

### Workarounds

* Assure there is no user/external access to the application using [petl](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl)
* Assure your application is not using the function [fromxml()](https://petl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/io.html#petl.io.xml.fromxml)
