Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-29660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause lies in a locking inconsistency within the Linux kernel's tty subsystem, specifically in the `drivers/tty/tty_io.c` and `drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c` files. The `->session` member of the `tty_struct` was not consistently protected by locks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Locking Inconsistency:** The primary weakness is the inconsistent locking of the `->session` member. Some parts of the code protected it with the tty mutex, while others did not, leading to a race condition.
- **Read-After-Free:** This inconsistency could lead to a read-after-free vulnerability. A race could occur where the `->session` pointer is freed by one thread while another thread is still trying to read from it using the `TIOCGSID` ioctl.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leak:**  A local attacker can exploit this flaw to read 4 bytes of freed kernel memory using the `TIOCGSID` ioctl.
- **Potential for other issues**: The lack of locking could potentially result in other issues, such as memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **`TIOCGSID` ioctl:** The vulnerability is triggered by using the `TIOCGSID` ioctl.
- **Race Condition:** The attacker has to trigger a specific race condition within the locking of the tty subsystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user.
- **Unprivileged User:** According to some sources, the vulnerability can be exploited by an unprivileged user on a `PREEMPT=y` system. Some sources specify the need for `CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG` privileges on RHEL7 and RHEL8 without user namespaces.
- **Timing/Preemption:** Exploitation relies on precise timing or preemption of threads during the race condition.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Files:** `drivers/tty/tty_io.c` and `drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c` were specifically mentioned
- **Fix:** The fix involves ensuring that the `tty_lock()` is held by all writers of `->session`,  the `ctrl_lock` is held by all writers, and all readers that aren't holding `tty_lock()` hold `ctrl_lock`.
- **Upstream Patch:** The commit `c8bcd9c5be24fb9e6132e97da5a35e55a83e36b9` in the Linux kernel source tree fixes this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2020-29660 describes a locking inconsistency in the tty subsystem that leads to a read-after-free vulnerability, potentially allowing a local unprivileged user to leak kernel memory.
