Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29003:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the PollNY extension for MediaWiki. Specifically, the 'choice' option for polls was not being properly escaped before being displayed, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. Malicious JavaScript code could be injected into the poll's answer options. This code would then be executed in the browsers of other users who viewed the poll.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The PollNY extension failed to properly sanitize user-provided input when rendering poll choices. Specifically, HTML special characters in the poll choices were not encoded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser.
- **Account Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information, leading to account compromise.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could manipulate displayed content or redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could use the XSS to distribute malware to users visiting the page.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could deface the content of the poll or the page on which the poll is embedded.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Poll Creation/Editing:** Attackers could create a new poll via Special:CreatePoll or edit an existing one via Special:UpdatePoll.
- **Malicious Input:** They would insert malicious JavaScript code, such as `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, into the poll's answer options.
- **Poll Views:** The malicious code would then execute when users viewed the poll directly in the `NS_POLL` namespace or when the poll was embedded on another wiki page using the `pollembed` parser tag.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker would need to be a user authorized to create or edit polls.
- **Access to Poll Creation/Editing Interface:** They require access to the `Special:CreatePoll` or `Special:UpdatePoll` interface.
- **Understanding of HTML/JavaScript:** They need basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript to craft the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided patch includes the use of `htmlspecialchars()` to encode the HTML special characters within poll options, which prevents the execution of malicious javascript code when the poll is displayed to users.
- The issue was present in both the master branch and the `REL1_35` branch of the `mediawiki/extensions/PollNY` repository.
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-27957, which was present in the RandomGameUnit extension but this one was specific to PollNY.
- The fix involved not only encoding the HTML characters but also ensuring all injected parameters were integers.
