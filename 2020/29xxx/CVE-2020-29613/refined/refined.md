- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic issue in the handling of enterprise application installation prompts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is described as a "logic issue". Specifically, the application installation prompt may display the wrong domain. This indicates a flaw in the way the system manages the state of the application installation process, leading to the display of an incorrect domain name within the prompt.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially mislead a user by displaying the wrong domain during the installation of an enterprise application. This could lead users to install malicious applications, believing they are from a trusted source.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the installation of enterprise applications, likely utilizing a crafted installation package that exploits the logic flaw.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft or control enterprise application installation prompts in order to exploit this vulnerability. They would need to have the capability to deliver a malicious application package.
