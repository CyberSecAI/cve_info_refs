Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect path access check within the `ConfluenceResourceDownloadRewriteRule` class in Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper access control: The path access check logic was flawed, allowing access to files that should have been restricted.
- Arbitrary file read: This flaw enabled the ability to read files within `WEB-INF` and `META-INF` directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive information by reading configuration files, application code, or other internal resources within the `WEB-INF` and `META-INF` directories. This could lead to further attacks or compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated access: The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without any prior authentication.
- HTTP requests: Exploitation likely involves crafting specific HTTP requests to trigger the vulnerability within the `ConfluenceResourceDownloadRewriteRule` class.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Confluence server.
- No authentication required:  The attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.3, rated as "Medium" severity.
- The vulnerability affects versions prior to 6.13.18, versions 6.14.0 to 7.4.6, and versions 7.5.0 to 7.8.3 of Confluence server.
- Fixed versions include 6.13.18, 7.4.6, 7.8.3 and 7.9.0.
- The vulnerability is related to other similar file read vulnerabilities in Atlassian products: CWD-5685 (Crowd), JRASERVER-72695 (Jira), and CONFSERVER-67893 (Confluence).
