| | Proprietary Code CVE(s) | Description | CVSSBase Score | CVSS Vector String | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | CVE-2020-29493 | DELL EMC Avamar Server, versions 19.1, 19.2, 19.3, contain a SQL Injection Vulnerability in Fitness Analyzer. A remote unauthenticated attacker may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of certain SQL commands on the application's backend database, causing unauthorized read and write access to application data. Exploitation may lead to leakage or deletion of sensitive backup data; hence the severity is Critical. Dell EMC recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity. | 10.0 | CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H | | CVE-2020-29494 | Dell EMC Avamar Server, versions 19.1, 19.2, 19.3, contain a Path Traversal Vulnerability in PDM. A remote user may potentially exploit this vulnerability, to gain unauthorized write access to the arbitrary files stored on the server filesystem, causing deletion of arbitrary files. | 8.7 | CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H | | CVE-2020-29495 | DELL EMC Avamar Server, versions 19.1, 19.2, 19.3, contain an OS Command Injection Vulnerability in Fitness Analyzer. A remote unauthenticated attacker may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands on the application's underlying OS with high privileges. This vulnerability is considered critical as it can be leveraged to completely compromise the vulnerable application as well as the underlying operating system. Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity. | 10.0 | CVSS:3.1/ AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H | |  |  |  |
