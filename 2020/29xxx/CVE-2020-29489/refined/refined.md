- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the storage of user credentials, including those with Unisphere admin privileges, in plaintext within a system file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Plaintext password storage.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local authenticated attacker can leverage the exposed password to gain access with the same privileges as the compromised user. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system manipulation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have authenticated access to the system and the ability to access system files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local authenticated attacker with access to system files.
