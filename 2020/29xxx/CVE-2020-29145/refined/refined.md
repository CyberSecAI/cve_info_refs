Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-29145:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization within the Ericsson BSCS iX R18 Billing & Rating platform, specifically in the ADMX and MX web modules. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into data fields that are later displayed to other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** Exploiting the XSS vulnerability allows for the potential hijacking of user sessions.
*   **Account Takeover:** Successful session hijacking can lead to full account takeover.
*   **Browser Exploitation:** Attackers can use the XSS vulnerability to exploit the browsers of administrators or other users.
*   **Malware delivery:** Attackers can redirect to malicious sites or trigger downloads via scripts.
*   **Information Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive data displayed in the application via the XSS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **ADMX Module:**
    *   An attacker must log in to the ADMX portal.
    *   They navigate to the "Reference Data" section by visiting `/ADMX/solutionUnitServlet?SuName=UserReferenceDataSU` or manually clicking "Security Tab" and then "Reference Data Tab".
    *   A new "Access Rights Group" is created.
    *   A malicious XSS payload is entered in the description field of the new "Access Rights Group".
    *   Upon saving, the stored XSS payload is executed.
*   **MX Module:**
    *   The attacker must access the MX portal.
    *   They navigate to the "Alert Dashboard" section.
    *   They double-click on any alert on the dashboard.
    *   A malicious XSS payload is entered into the comment section of the alert.
    *   Clicking "OK" will store the XSS payload permanently, and the payload gets executed when other users view it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Ericsson BSCS iX R18 Billing & Rating platform:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the platform to access the vulnerable modules.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable input fields:** The attacker needs to know where to inject the malicious payload within the ADMX and MX modules to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not seem to need special privileges to exploit the stored XSS vulnerability other than normal access to the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The blog post provides detailed steps and screenshots (though the images are not retrievable) to demonstrate how to exploit the vulnerability in both the ADMX and MX modules.
*   The exploit can be used to execute malicious JavaScript code within the browsers of users interacting with the vulnerable sections.
*   The impact is amplified due to the possibility of session hijacking and full account takeover.
*   The blog post mentions the use of the BeEF framework, suggesting that attackers can use this for more advanced browser exploitation.
