A buffer overflow in the dlt\_filter\_load function in dlt\_common.c in dlt-daemon allows arbitrary code execution via an unsafe usage of fscanf, because it does not limit the number of characters to be read in a format argument.

Fixed: [#274](https://github.com/COVESA/dlt-daemon/issues/274)

Package        : dlt-daemon
Version        : 2.18.0-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-29394 CVE-2020-36244 CVE-2022-31291
Debian Bug     : 976228 1014534

dlt-daemon, a Diagnostic Log and Trace logging daemon, had the following
vulnerabilities reported:

CVE-2020-29394

    A buffer overflow in the dlt_filter_load function in dlt_common.c
    from dlt-daemon allows arbitrary code execution because fscanf is
    misused (no limit on the number of characters to be read in the
    format argument).

CVE-2020-36244

    dlt-daemon was vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow that
    could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-31291

    An issue in dlt_config_file_parser.c of dlt-daemon allows attackers
    to cause a double free via crafted TCP packets.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.18.0-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dlt-daemon packages.

For the detailed security status of dlt-daemon please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/dlt-daemon>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## Description

![@gy741](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29292618?u=7cc5e74860fca03029e14502acf81440303c3002&v=4&size=48)[gy741](https://github.com/gy741)opened [on Nov 28, 2020](https://github.com/COVESA/dlt-daemon/issues/274#issue-752585674)
## Summary

An exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the dlt-daemon, A specially crafted Filter file can cause a buffer overflow, resulting in multiple corruptions and potentially code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted file to trigger this vulnerability.

## Details

A buffer overflow in the dlt\_filter\_load function in dlt\_common.c in dlt-daemon allows arbitrary code execution via an unsafe usage of fscanf, because it does not limit the number of characters to be read in a format argument.

## Affected

1. dlt-receive
2. dlt-sortbytimestamp
3. dlt-convert

## PoC

```
python -c 'print "A"*318' > poc.txt

(gdb) r -f poc.txt localhost

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.
