  "CVE-2020-29394": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow in the dlt_filter_load function in dlt_common.c in dlt-daemon 2.8.5 (GENIVI Diagnostic Log and Trace) allows arbitrary code execution because fscanf is misused (no limit on the number of characters to be read in a format argument).",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an unsafe usage of the `fscanf` function in the `dlt_filter_load` function in `dlt_common.c`. Specifically, `fscanf` is used without limiting the number of characters to be read, leading to a buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
         "Unsafe use of fscanf"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution",
      "attack_vectors": "By providing a specially crafted filter file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted file to trigger the vulnerability. This could potentially be a local file."
    },
    "affected_components": [
      "dlt-receive",
      "dlt-sortbytimestamp",
      "dlt-convert"
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was addressed by using dynamic formatting in fscanf to prevent buffer overflow"
