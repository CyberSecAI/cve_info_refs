The provided content is related to CVE-2020-29204.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the `UserController.java` file of the `xxl-job-admin` module, specifically related to adding users. The application does not properly sanitize user input when adding user information, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application stores unsanitized user-provided data which, when later displayed to other users, can execute malicious JavaScript code.
- Insufficient Input Validation: There's a lack of input validation and sanitization in user creation. The system does not prevent users from inserting malicious script tags in fields.
- Bypass of Length Limitation: The issue description mentions "Escape 20 length limit," implying that a previous length limit check on user inputs (likely for a name or username field) was bypassed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The malicious script executes when a user views the stored input containing the script.
- This could allow an attacker to perform various actions, such as stealing cookies/session tokens, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user, including modifying data or gaining elevated privileges within the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the user creation functionality within the `xxl-job-admin` web interface.
- An attacker adds a user through the web interface, injecting a malicious JavaScript payload into one of the input fields (likely the name field).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the user creation interface.
-  An account with user creation privilege is required to inject the malicious payload.
