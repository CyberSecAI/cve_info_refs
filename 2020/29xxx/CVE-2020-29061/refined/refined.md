Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-29061:

**Relates to CVE:** Yes, this content specifically discusses CVE-2020-29061 as part of a series of vulnerabilities found in CDATA OLT devices.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of hardcoded, undocumented backdoor credentials that provide administrative access to the device via Telnet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Backdoor Account:** The presence of hardcoded credentials (`suma123`/`panger123`, `debug`/`debug124`, `root`/`root126`, `guest`/`[empty]`) allows unauthorized access to the device.
- **Telnet service enabled on WAN:** The Telnet service is exposed to the WAN interface, increasing the attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full administrative access:** Attackers gain complete administrator CLI access to the OLT.
- **Configuration Overwrite:** With admin access, the attacker can completely overwrite the device's configuration.
- **Firmware Overwrite:** Attackers can overwrite the device's firmware, potentially leading to further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Telnet:** The vulnerability is exploited through the Telnet service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OLT's Telnet service, which can be reachable through the WAN or the FTTH LAN (from the ONTs).
- **Knowledge of Backdoor Credentials:** The attacker needs to know the specific hardcoded credentials used by the device.

**Additional Details:**
- The article provides a detailed list of affected OLT models and firmware versions.
- The content shows the various command line interfaces and capabilities available based on different sets of credentials.
- The article indicates that these backdoors are intentional based on the vendor's behavior and this is a full disclosure advisory.
