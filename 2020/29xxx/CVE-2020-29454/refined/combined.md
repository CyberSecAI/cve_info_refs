### @nul800sebastiaan **[nul800sebastiaan](/nul800sebastiaan)** commented [Nov 9, 2020](#issue-738849024) • edited Loading

This fix is a result of a security scan where an issue was discovered: authenticated Umbraco backoffice users without access to the Settings section could use the API endpoint to read Umbraco logs.

The security firm Trustwave [published a blog post](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/elevate-yourself-to-admin-in-umb-cms-890-cve-2020-29454/) about this on April 1st, 2021.

In our opinion this post exaggerates the risk. You can *not* elevate yourself to admin with the logviewer endpoints. This is speculation and depends on people writing dangerous custom code on purpose. That scenario is not unthinkable but highly unlikely.

## Details about this issue

* The endpoint was only available to users logged into the Umbraco backoffice
  + not available for any website visitors
* Endpoint should only have been available for people to Umbraco backoffice users with access to the Settings section
  + but was also available for editors, translators, etc. anyone who could log into the backoffice
* To abuse this endpoint access, the user would need to know how to find it somehow and then need to know how to call the endpoint with the correct parameters
  + the risk of regular users knowing how to do this is quite low
  + you know exactly who is a user in the backoffice, presumably you haven’t invited someone in who has malicious intentions
* The information in the logs that Umbraco writes does NOT by default allow you to elevate privileges, this is only a theoretical issue
  + for example: if your custom implementation of Umbraco were to log backoffice user passwords into the logs then it would allow you to elevate privileges (needless to say: *please do not ever log passwords in the logs!*)
* We determined that the severity of this security issue was low
  + the security firm categorized it as medium because of the hypothetical risk of custom implementations putting too much information in the logs, which we believe would be a rare occurrence

## About this fix

* The endpoint was created in Umbraco 8.0.0 - *version 7 is NOT affected*
* The endpoint was properly secured in version 8.10.0 with this pull request:
  + That means v8.0.0 through v8.9.3 were the affected versions

## Dependabot - GitHub security response

Trustwave also [created a CVE for this issue](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29454). This CVE changed on the 12th of April 2021 to list ALL previous versions of Umbraco to be vulnerable, which is incorrect, the issue only affects v8.0.0-v8.9.1.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/304656/114701815-95f1cc80-9d23-11eb-8f48-fa7be5f5f53c.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/304656/114701815-95f1cc80-9d23-11eb-8f48-fa7be5f5f53c.png)

Subsequently, GitHub picked up on this CVE. GitHub has a security scanner that analyses any vulnerable software and notifies people that depend on that software to update anything with a security issue. This service is best known as “dependabot”, their account that makes a PR to fix vulnerabilities.

Since the version range was listed incorrectly, everybody depending on any version of Umbraco (<8.10.0) got a notification from GitHub telling them to upgrade.

## Security notifications from Umbraco

When we find security issues, we will send out notifications when they are serious enough, you can read up on this [in our Trust Center](https://umbraco.com/about-us/trust-center/security-and-umbraco/how-to-get-informed-about-security-advisories/):

> When we have security-related announcements we believe you need to be explicitly aware of, we announce them in the following ways on the day we publish a patch or manual workaround (..)

From our assessment, this issue was not severe enough to send out notifications.

Sorry, something went wrong.
