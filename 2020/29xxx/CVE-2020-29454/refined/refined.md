The provided content is related to CVE-2020-29454.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An API endpoint in Umbraco versions 8.0.0 to 8.9.3 that was intended to be accessible only to backoffice users with access to the Settings section was also accessible to other authenticated backoffice users (editors, translators, etc.) without the necessary permissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate access control on logviewer API endpoint.
- Exposure of log information to unauthorized users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized users could potentially access sensitive information from Umbraco logs.
- The blog post by Trustwave exaggerates the risk of privilege escalation but is possible if custom implementations log sensitive information like passwords.
- Information disclosure of log data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Authenticated backoffice users without access to the Settings section could access the logviewer endpoint.
- Attackers must know the API endpoint and how to call it with the correct parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must have a valid login to the Umbraco backoffice.
- No specific privileges are needed other than a valid backoffice account.
- Attacker must be familiar with Umbraco API endpoints to exploit this vulnerability.
