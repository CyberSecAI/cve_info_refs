Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` package. Specifically, the `NewServerConn` function is vulnerable to a nil pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A crafted authentication request message using the "gssapi-with-mic" method can cause a panic in SSH servers.
- The vulnerability is triggered when `ServerConfig.GSSAPIWithMICConfig` is `nil`, leading to a nil pointer dereference within `NewServerConn`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the SSH server due to the panic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker sends a specially crafted authentication request message for the "gssapi-with-mic" authentication method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate an SSH connection to the vulnerable server. They also need to be able to send the crafted malicious authentication request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in `golang.org/x/crypto` version `v0.0.0-20201216223049-8b5274cf687f`.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Joern Schneewesiz of the GitLab Security Research Team.
- The affected component is the `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` package.
