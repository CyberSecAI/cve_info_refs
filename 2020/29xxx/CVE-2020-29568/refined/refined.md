Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-29568:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by unbounded queueing of watch events in the backend. Some OSes process watch events using a single thread. If events are received faster than the thread can handle, they are queued. Because the queue is unbounded, a guest can trigger an out-of-memory (OOM) condition in the backend.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unbounded queue: The queue used to handle watch events is unbounded, meaning it can grow indefinitely if events are received faster than they can be processed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (OOM): A malicious guest can trigger an out-of-memory (OOM) condition in the backend, causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious guest can exploit the vulnerability by rapidly sending watch events that overwhelm the backend's event processing thread, causing excessive memory consumption in the backend.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a malicious guest with the capability to trigger watch events.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is specific to systems using FreeBSD, Linux, or NetBSD dom0 as the backend OS.
- There was no known mitigation at the time of discovery, and the resolution involved applying a patch to the Linux kernel.
- The advisory is also tracked under the identifier XSA-349.
