Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29469:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Menu" setting of WonderCMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the Menu section of the WonderCMS settings. This code is then stored persistently in the application and executed each time a user visits a page, leading to a persistent XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Stealing:** The injected JavaScript can be used to steal cookies, potentially allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser, potentially performing actions on behalf of the user or redirecting them to malicious sites, modifying the website's appearance and behaviour, or performing other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must have the ability to modify the WonderCMS menu settings. This means they must have access to the administrative interface of the WonderCMS installation, either by being a legitimate administrator, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain administrative access.
- The attacker injects the malicious XSS payload into the menu parameter through the settings interface.
- Every time a user visits the website, the injected script is executed from the rendered HTML for the menu.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs administrative privileges to access the "Settings-Menu" section of the WonderCMS backend.
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious XSS payload.
