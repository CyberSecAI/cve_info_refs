Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29603:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way MantisBT handles project name display in the navigation bar's project selector. When a logged-in user attempts to access a private project directly (e.g., through `manage_proj_edit_page.php?project_id=PRIVATE_PROJECT_ID`), they receive an "Access Denied" error. However, the project selector in the navigation bar still renders the private project's name, effectively disclosing it to the unauthorized user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the unintended disclosure of private project names. Even though access to the project itself is restricted, the name is still revealed.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The application fails to properly check user permissions when rendering the project selection menu, leading to the exposure of private project names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Violation:** The names of private projects, which should be confidential, are exposed to unauthorized users.
- **Potential Reconnaissance:** Attackers can use this information to understand the structure and organization of projects within MantisBT, potentially aiding in further targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** An attacker can directly request the `manage_proj_edit_page.php` for a private project.
- **Navigation Bar Exposure:** The vulnerability is triggered by simply navigating the application as a logged in user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Logged-in User:** The attacker must have a valid user account within the MantisBT system.
- **Basic Knowledge of MantisBT:** The attacker needs to know how to navigate the application and identify the project selection menu.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content also mentions that this vulnerability was part of a larger report that included two additional vulnerabilities related to disclosure of private issue summaries and full disclosure of private issue contents, tracked as CVE-2020-29605 and CVE-2020-29604, respectively.
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented by modifying the `layout_api.php` file to check user access before displaying project names in the dropdown menu, ensuring that private projects are not shown to unauthorized users.
- The fix was introduced in MantisBT version 2.24.4.
