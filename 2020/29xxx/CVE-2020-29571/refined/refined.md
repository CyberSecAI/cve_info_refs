{
  "cve": "CVE-2020-29571",
  "description": "A bounds check common to most operation time functions specific to FIFO event channels depends on the CPU observing consistent state. While the producer side uses appropriately ordered writes, the consumer side isn't protected against re-ordered reads, and may hence end up de-referencing a NULL pointer.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards"
  ],
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The consumer side of FIFO event channels is not protected against re-ordered reads when accessing the control structure, potentially dereferencing a NULL pointer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper ordering of memory reads",
      "Potential NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the entire system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Guest to host"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A malicious or buggy guest kernel"
  },
  "cvss": {
    "score": "N/A",
    "vector": "N/A"
  },
  "remediation": "Apply the provided patch which resolves the issue.",
    "notes": "Only Arm systems may be vulnerable, depending on the specific CPU. x86 systems are not vulnerable."
