- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Hardcoded telnet credentials in the firmware of D-Link DIR-868L router.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hardcoded default username and password for the telnet service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain access to the router's firmware and extract sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to decompile the router's firmware to extract the hardcoded credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs the ability to extract the firmware, but does not require authentication before this stage.
