Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29139:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper use of the `add_escape_custom()` function in `library/patient.inc`. This function, intended for escaping user input, does not enclose the escaped data in quotes, which are necessary for SQL queries and leads to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Because the output of `add_escape_custom()` is not quoted, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to:
    - Data breaches (accessing sensitive patient data)
    - Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data)
    - Potential for further compromise of the system

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a GET request to `/interface/main/finder/patient_select.php`.
- The `searchFields` parameter is used to inject the malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a valid administrator account to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to know the correct `csrf_token_form` and have a valid `OpenEMR` session cookie.
