  "CVE-2020-29385": {
    "description": "GNOME gdk-pixbuf (aka GdkPixbuf) before 2.42.2 allows a denial of service (infinite loop) in lzw.c in the function write_indexes. if c->self_code equals 10, self->code_table[10].extends will assign the value 11 to c. The next execution in the loop will assign self->code_table[11].extends to c, which will give the value of 10. This will make the loop run infinitely. This bug can, for example, be triggered by calling this function with a GIF image with LZW compression that is crafted in a special way.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the LZW decoding algorithm within the `write_indexes` function in `lzw.c`. Specifically, the code fails to properly handle a specific scenario where an invalid LZW code after a reset can lead to an infinite loop.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of LZW codes during GIF image decompression.",
        "Lack of validation for LZW codes after a reset within the decoding loop."
      ],
      "impact": "A crafted GIF image can trigger an infinite loop in the LZW decoding process, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This causes the affected application to hang and consume excessive CPU resources.",
      "attack_vectors": "The primary attack vector involves tricking a user or automated system into opening a specially crafted GIF image.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create a specifically crafted GIF image with an LZW compression that triggers the faulty logic within gdk-pixbuf's `write_indexes` function. No special privileges are required, it can be triggered by a normal user."
    },
     "affected_components": [
        "gdk-pixbuf library",
         "Applications using gdk-pixbuf for image loading, such as file managers, web browsers, and email clients."
