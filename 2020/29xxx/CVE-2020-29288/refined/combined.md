##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Gym Management System using PHP/MySQLi with Source Code

 [![](/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2020-10/images/gym.png?itok=e6H_njgA)](/sites/default/files/2020-10/images/gym.png)

**Project: Gym Management System using PHP/MySQLi**

## **About**

The Gym Management System is a simple PHP/MySQLi project that manages a fitness gym business memberships and payments records. The system stores the fitness gym membership plans, packages, and trainers. The plan list helps organize the member's selected plan for his/her membership with the fitness gym and each plan are one-time payment only, which means the membership fee of the members are based on their selected plan and this refers to how long the member will be marked as an active member in the fitness gym. The packages list refers to the list of packages that the fitness gym management offers to their members and this program of the fitness gym is payable by month until the expiration of the member's membership. The trainer list will be used if the member will hire also a trainer if every trainer is not included in his/her package. The trainer's rate will be added to the monthly amount payable to the member. The membership can be renewed when the fitness gym member's membership plan will expire, which means the member can extend his/her membership, and the gym management system will include the membership fee again to the first-month payment of the member after his/her previous membership expires. The gym management or the system user must end the plan of the member if the member will change his/her membership plan or packages after his/her previous membership plan expires to allow the system to know that the member is not active anymore in any membership plan and packages.

## Features

* **Login Page**
  + The page where the system users will submit their system credentials to access the gym management system data.
* **Home Page**
  + The page where the system users will be redirected by default after logging in.
* **Plan Page**
  + The page where the fitness gym membership plans are listed and can be managed.
* **Packages Page**
  + The page where the system users will populate the list of the packages they offer to their members.
* **Members Page**
  + The page where the fitness gym members are listed and managed.
* **Member Details Modal**
  + The popup modal in the member's page that shows the member's details, and active/previous membership plans.
* **Trainers Page**
  + The page where the list of fitness gym trainers are listed and managed.
* **Membership Validity Page**
  + The page where the list of active member's plan are listed and managed.
* **Schedule Page**
  + **​​​​​​​**The page where can system user schedule or store the expected date of the member's presence. This feature only for the fitness gym management's reference to check the expected members on a certain date.

## How to Run

1. Download the source code and extract the **zip**file.
2. Download or set up any local web server that runs PHP script.
3. Open the web-server database and create a new database name it **gym****\_db**.
4. Import the **SQL**file located in the database folder of the source code.
5. Copy and paste the source code to the location where your local web server accessing your local projects. Example for XAMPP('C:\xampp\htdocs')
6. Open a web browser and browse the project. E.g [**http://localhost/gym-management-system**]

## Admin Default Access

Username: admin

Password: admin123

I hope the Gym Management System project source code will help you with what you are looking for. Feel free to download and modify the source code.

Explore more on this website for more source codes and tutorials.

Enjoy!

Note: Due to the size or complexity of this submission, the author has submitted it as a .zip file to shorten your download time. After downloading it, you will need a program like Winzip to decompress it.

Virus note: All files are scanned once-a-day by SourceCodester.com for viruses, but new viruses come out every day, so no prevention program can catch 100% of them.

FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY, PLEASE:

1. Re-scan downloaded files using your personal virus checker before using it.

2. NEVER, EVER run compiled files (.exe's, .ocx's, .dll's etc.)--only run source code.
