  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the 'id' parameter of the 'manage_user.php' file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion. The example provided shows an attacker extracting the database name and version, which can be used for further exploitation.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP GET requests.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability in the manage_user.php file."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The provided exploit code demonstrates extracting database information. More sophisticated queries can be crafted to achieve a wider range of malicious actions. The vulnerable parameter is 'id' and the vulnerable file is 'manage_user.php'."
