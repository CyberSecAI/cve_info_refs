  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Out-of-bounds read access in `ide_atapi_cmd_reply_end` due to lack of validation of the buffer index `s->io_buffer_index` against the buffer length `s->io_buffer_total_len` during ATAPI read command processing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Buffer over-read",

    "impact": "An attacker can trigger an out-of-bounds read, causing a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the QEMU process on the host.",
    "attack_vectors": "A guest OS user can send a crafted ATAPI read command, setting an invalid logical block address (LBA), which then leads to the out-of-bounds read.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within the guest operating system to send crafted ATAPI commands to the virtual hardware.",
