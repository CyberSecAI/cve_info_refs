Benefits
### Features included in all packages

* #### No IT Team Required

  Our plans are easy to manage - no installation, servers or server maintenance to worry about. We handle it all for you, giving you the ability to focus on developing your community instead.
* #### Use Your Own Domain

  Want to use your own web address? No problem. Any plan can be set up to use a domain name you already own, for free. Simply enter it when creating your plan, and we will be in touch to set it up.
* #### Fully Customizable & Integratable

  Our plans include all the same customization and integration tools as the self-hosted license, including themeing, Wordpress & oAuth single sign-on, the ability to install third-party addons, and much more.
* #### All Apps Included

  Our Creator and higher plans include all seven of our apps, so you get everything you need to build incredible communities, with discussion forums, file sharing, content management and more.
* #### Your Data Belongs To You

  Unlike some other providers, we don't hold your data hostage or deny access altogether. It's yours, and should you decide to leave us we promise we will provide it to you, for free.
* #### Powerful Infrastructure

  Our platform is specially designed to power demanding communities. We have over 15 years experience in hosting some of the best communities on the web, so you're in safe hands.

### Frequently Asked Questions

* Can I choose the domain name for my community?

  Yes! When you purchase your plan, during the checkout process, you are assigned a temporary \*.invisionservice.com domain. At any point after your plan is set up, you can request the domain name change in the Client Area and our support team will assist you.
* Can I use SSL/TLS community?

  Yes, all of our plans include free TLS (HTTPS). If you choose to use one of our provided domains, TLS is automatically configured for you. If you instead choose to use your own domain, you need to contact us after purchasing so that we can set it up on your account.
* Can I upgrade my plan?

  Of course! There's no additional fee to upgrade (or downgrade) your plan at any time. You can change your plan via the client area, or contact accounts@invisionpower.com and we make the switch for you.
* Can I purchase more storage?

  We don't currently offer additional storage on individual plan levels. If you require additional storage, simply contact accounts@invisionpower.com to upgrade to the next plan level or make the upgrade in the client area.
* Do plans include Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection?

  Our network mitigates most DDoS attacks before they can impact your community. However, if your community becomes a frequent target of DDoS attacks, we may ask you to move to a self-hosted community in order to protect the integrity of our platform.

* Can I install new themes, modifications etc.?

  You can download and install new themes, applications, hooks, languages and more, and install them via your administration control panel.
* What happens if I go over my limits?

  When you get close to your package limits, we will contact you to let you know. If the average users in a 48 hour window exceeds your package limits, we automatically upgrade you to our next package level. IPS is here to help you grow your community and we will work with you, communicate, and help you transition along the way. You should never worry about being deactivated for going over your package limits.
* Am I tied into a long-term contract?

  No - all of our standard packages run on a month-to-month basis.
* If I cancel, can I keep my community?

  You are always entitled to a backup of your data. To continue to make use of it, you need to purchase a self-hosted license.
* Who owns my data?

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Here's why you'll get from first idea to final outcome faster

#### The Intelligent Canvas™

Big ideas need a collaborative space to bring them to life. We designed the canvas to give teams infinite opportunities to add content, move projects forward, and work together until ideas become reality.

#### Where ideas turn to actions

Bring ideas closer to reality and use documents, diagrams, tables, and timelines to transform creative chaos into clear plans.

#### With a space for every team

Organize all your project information in one place so that teams can get up to speed quickly. You can even add content and data from Google, Microsoft, Adobe, and more.

## AI rapidly transforms your team's ideas into:

### Prototypes

Get to customer feedback faster by letting AI transform your canvas ideas into interactive prototypes in moments.

### Briefs

Turn ideas on sticky notes into structured text documents like product briefs, research insights, or workshop summaries at the touch of a button.

### Plans

Make the leap from brainstorm to project plan using tables and timelines to help you keep track of your project.

### Diagrams

Visualize user flows, processes and complex technical systems from just a few lines of text, and take advantage of more than 2,000 diagram shapes.
