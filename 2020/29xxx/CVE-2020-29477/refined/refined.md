Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29477:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization of the 'Field Name' parameter in the profile settings of Invision Community.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a profile field, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or other malicious actions.
- Privilege Escalation: If an administrator views the crafted field, the attacker may gain administrative privileges depending on the actions of the script.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web Interface: The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code and injects it into the "Field Name" parameter when creating a new profile field through the admin panel.
- Stored XSS: The payload is stored in the database and executed when the crafted profile field is viewed by other users or administrators.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Administrator Access: The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator or have administrative privileges in order to access the Members - MEMBER SETTINGS - Profiles section of the admin panel and create new profile fields.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-29477 describes a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability within Invision Community 4.5.4. By manipulating the "Field Name" parameter when adding a new profile field, an attacker with administrative access can inject malicious javascript that executes when that field is viewed.
