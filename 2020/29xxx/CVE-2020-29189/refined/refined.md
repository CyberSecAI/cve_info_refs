Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29189:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect access control mechanism when creating a user and assigning group permissions. Specifically, the 'right' parameter within the `pathChmod` request allows bypassing read-only restrictions by setting a value of "2" instead of "1", which grants read/write access regardless of the intended group permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The system fails to enforce intended read-only restrictions for user groups, allowing users to gain write access when they should only have read access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** An attacker could modify data they shouldn't have write access to, including files and folders within the NAS.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly stated as privilege escalation, it allows users with limited read-only access to modify system settings, which might lead to further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted POST request to the `/tos/index.php?explorer/pathChmod` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user that already has read access to the targeted folders.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable parameter is `right` within the `list` array of the POST request to `/tos/index.php?explorer/pathChmod`.
*   The value `2` assigned to `right` grants read/write access, while `1` is intended for read-only access.
*   The 'userlist' parameter specifies the users and groups affected by the permission change.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided write-up is more descriptive than the standard CVE description.
* This vulnerability is specific to TerraMaster TOS version 4.2.06 and was fixed in version 4.2.07.
