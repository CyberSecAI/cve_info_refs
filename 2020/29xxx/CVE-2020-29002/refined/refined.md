Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29002:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper escaping of the `qbfind` message within the CologneBlue skin for MediaWiki. Specifically, the `qbfind` message was being rendered without sanitization, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and Javascript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is an XSS flaw. Malicious code could be inserted through the `qbfind` message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Javascript Execution:** By setting a malicious `qbfind` message containing Javascript, an attacker could execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Data theft
  - Other malicious activities within the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves setting a specially crafted `qbfind` message containing malicious Javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrator privileges:** The `qbfind` message is a system message, meaning that the attacker would need to compromise an administrator/sysop account to modify the message and inject the malicious payload.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was discovered during code review.
- Patches were created and applied to multiple branches of the CologneBlue skin.
- The vulnerability was initially considered low risk because it requires admin privileges. However, the security team decided to treat it as a valid security issue due to the potential impact of a compromised sysop account.
- The fix involves properly escaping the `qbfind` message to prevent the execution of arbitrary HTML and Javascript.
- This vulnerability was publicly flagged in gerrit but was tracked internally by the security team initially.
