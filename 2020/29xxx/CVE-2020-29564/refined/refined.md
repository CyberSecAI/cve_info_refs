Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The official Consul Docker images from version 0.7.1 through 1.4.2 contained a blank password for the root user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary vulnerability is the presence of an empty password for the root user in the `/etc/shadow` file within the affected Docker images.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could gain root access to systems using the vulnerable Consul Docker container by logging in with the blank password.
- This results in a complete compromise of the system running the container, allowing attackers to perform any privileged operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the vulnerable Consul Docker image itself.
- Systems using the affected versions of the Docker image are susceptible.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the system running the vulnerable Consul Docker container.
- No other specific capabilities are explicitly mentioned, other than the ability to remotely login via a method which uses the system's password store.
