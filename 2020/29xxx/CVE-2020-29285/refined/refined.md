Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-29285

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw in the "Point of Sales 1.0" application, specifically within the `edit_category.php` file. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which arises from the lack of proper input validation/sanitization in the `edit_category.php` file's handling of the `id` parameter.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    * The attack vector is through the `id` parameter of the `edit_category.php` file. Specifically, an attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in the URL.
    * Example URLs:
        *   `http://192.168.100.234/pos/edit_category.php?id=1'`
        *   `http://192.168.100.234/pos/edit_category.php?id=1' --+`
        *   `http://192.168.100.234/pos/edit_category.php?id=1' order by 1,2--+`
        *   `http://192.168.100.234/pos/edit_category.php?id=-1' UNION Select 1,2--+`
        *   `http://192.168.100.234/pos/edit_category.php?id=-1' UNION Select 1,database()--+`
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, customer details, product information, and financial records.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could also modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has higher privileges, the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    *   The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability using various techniques like adding single quotes, comments, `ORDER BY`, and `UNION SELECT` statements.
