mm: thp: make the THP mapcount atomic against \_\_split\_huge\_pmd\_locked()Write protect anon page faults require an accurate mapcount to decide
if to break the COW or not. This is implemented in the THP path with
reuse\_swap\_page() ->
page\_trans\_huge\_map\_swapcount()/page\_trans\_huge\_mapcount().
If the COW triggers while the other processes sharing the page are
under a huge pmd split, to do an accurate reading, we must ensure the
mapcount isn't computed while it's being transferred from the head
page to the tail pages.
reuse\_swap\_cache() already runs serialized by the page lock, so it's
enough to add the page lock around \_\_split\_huge\_pmd\_locked too, in
order to add the missing serialization.
Note: the commit in "Fixes" is just to facilitate the backporting,
because the code before such commit didn't try to do an accurate THP
mapcount calculation and it instead used the page\_count() to decide if
to COW or not. Both the page\_count and the pin\_count are THP-wide
refcounts, so they're inaccurate if used in
reuse\_swap\_page(). Reverting such commit (besides the unrelated fix to
the local anon\_vma assignment) would have also opened the window for
memory corruption side effects to certain workloads as documented in
such commit header.

perf symbols: Fix debuginfo search for Ubuntu
commit 85afd35575a3c1a3a905722dde5ee70b49282e70 upstream.

commit d7ff04031f4b2653191e944c6c2e2c85f021d64d

perf probe: Check address correctness by map instead of \_etext
commit 2ae5d0d7d8868df7c05c2013c0b9cddd4d40610e upstream.
Since commit 03db8b583d1c ("perf tools: Fix
maps\_\_find\_symbol\_by\_name()") introduced map address range check in
maps\_\_find\_symbol\_by\_name(), we can not get "\_etext" from kernel map
because \_etext is placed on the edge of the kernel .text section (=
kernel map in perf.)
To fix this issue, this checks the address correctness by map address
range information (map->start and map->end) instead of using \_etext
address.
This can cause an error if the target inlined function is embedded in
both \_\_init function and normal function.
For exaample, request\_resource() is a normal function but also embedded
in \_\_init reserve\_setup(). In this case, the probe point in
reserve\_setup() must be skipped.
However, without this fix, it failes to setup all probe points:
# ./perf probe -v request\_resource
probe-definition(0): request\_resource
symbol:request\_resource file:(null) line:0 offset:0 return:0 lazy:(null)
0 arguments

perf probe: Fix to check blacklist address correctly
commit 80526491c2ca6abc028c0f0dbb0707a1f35fb18a upstream.
Fix to check kprobe blacklist address correctly with relocated address
by adjusting debuginfo address.
Since the address in the debuginfo is same as objdump, it is different
from relocated kernel address with KASLR. Thus, 'perf probe' always
misses to catch the blacklisted addresses.
Without this patch, 'perf probe' can not detect the blacklist addresses
on a KASLR enabled kernel.
# perf probe kprobe\_dispatcher
Failed to write event: Invalid argument
Error: Failed to add events.
#
With this patch, it correctly shows the error message.
# perf probe kprobe\_dispatcher
kprobe\_dispatcher is blacklisted function, skip it.
Probe point 'kprobe\_dispatcher' not found.
Error: Failed to add events.

perf probe: Do not show the skipped events
commit f41ebe9defacddeae96a872a33f0f22ced0bfcef upstream.
When a probe point is expanded to several places (like inlined) and if
some of them are skipped because of blacklisted or \_\_init function,
those trace\_events has no event name. It must be skipped while showing
results.
Without this fix, you can see "(null):(null)" on the list,
# ./perf probe request\_resource

w1: omap-hdq: fix interrupt handling which did show spurious timeouts
commit 13db4c40fe0b20b80c7d1c91a9da8411e26b5c27 upstream.
Since
commit 27d13da8782a ("w1: omap-hdq: Simplify driver with PM runtime autosuspend")
was applied,
I did see timeouts and wrong values when reading a bq27000 connected
to hdq of the omap3. This occurred mainly after boot but remained and
only sometimes settled down after several reads.

Sometimes the effect did disappear after accessing
the device multiple times, speed went up and results
became correct.
All this indicates that some interrupts from the hdq
controller are lost by the driver.
Enabling debugging revealed that there were spurious tx
and rx timeouts, i.e. the driver does not always recognise
interrupts. The main problem is that rx and tx interrupts
share a single variable which was sometimes reset to
0 wiping out other interrupts. And it was overwritten
by a second interrupt, independent of whether the
previous interrupt was already processed or not.
This patch improves interrupt handling to avoid such
races and loss of interrupt flags.
The ideas are:
\* only the hdq\_isr() sets bits in hdq\_status
\* it does not reset any bits
\* it does wake\_up() if any interrupt is pending
\* bits are only reset by the read/write/break functions
if they were waited for
\* this makes sure that no interrupts can be lost
\* rx/tx/timeout bits are completely decoupled from each
other (and not reset all after waiting for any of them)
\* which bits to reset is now specified by a new parameter
to hdq\_reset\_irqstatus()
\* hdq\_reset\_irqstatus() also returns the state before
resetting so that we can encapsulate the spinlock
\* this should now handle the case that the write and read
are both already finished quickly before the hdq\_write\_byte()
ends.
\* Or that two interrupts occur in succession before
they are processed by the driver.
Old code may have reset all status bits making the next
hdq\_read\_byte() timeout.
\* the spinlock now always protects changing of bits in function
hdq\_reset\_irqstatus() which could become a read-write-modify
problem if the interrupt handler tries to read-modify-write
exactly at the same moment
\* we add mutex protection also for hdq\_write\_byte() just to
be safe to not to disturb a hdq\_read\_byte() triggered by
some other thread/process.
This patch was tested on a GTA04 and results in no
boot problems any more. And first read after boot is now ok:

w1: omap-hdq: fix return value to be -1 if there is a timeout
commit 2d4100632fa1947bf3e8d7a091e94e2cf21923af upstream.
omap\_w1\_read\_byte() should return -1 (or 0xff) in case of
error (e.g. missing battery).
The code accidentially overwrites the variable ret and not val,
which is returned. So it will return the initial value 0 instead
of -1.

calling nand\_release() is a bit of a hack as there is no MTD device to

commit 1d5d08ee9b28cff907326b4ad5a2463fd2808be1 upstream.
During ONFI detection, the CRC derived from the parameter page and the
CRC supposed to be at the end of the parameter page are compared. If
they do not match, the second then the third copies of the page are
tried.
The current implementation compares the newly derived CRC with the CRC
contained in the first page only. So if this particular CRC area has
been corrupted, then the detection will fail for a wrong reason.
Fix this issue by checking the derived CRC against the right one.

pwm: lpss: Fix get\_state runtime-pm reference handling
commit 01aa905d4791da7d3630f6030ff99d58105cca00 upstream.
Before commit cfc4c189bc70 ("pwm: Read initial hardware state at request
time"), a driver's get\_state callback would get called once per PWM from
pwmchip\_add().
pwm-lpss' runtime-pm code was relying on this, getting a runtime-pm ref for
PWMs which are enabled at probe time from within its get\_state callback,
before enabling runtime-pm.
The change to calling get\_state at request time causes a number of
problems:
1. PWMs enabled at probe time may get runtime suspended before they are
requested, causing e.g. a LCD backlight controlled by the PWM to turn off.
2. When the request happens when the PWM has been runtime suspended, the
ctrl register will read all 1 / 0xffffffff, causing get\_state to store
bogus values in the pwm\_state.
3. get\_state was using an async pm\_runtime\_get() call, because it assumed
that runtime-pm has not been enabled yet. If shortly after the request an
apply call is made, then the pwm\_lpss\_is\_updating() check may trigger
because the resume triggered by the pm\_runtime\_get() call is not complete
yet, so the ctrl register still reads all 1 / 0xffffffff.
This commit fixes these issues by moving the initial pm\_runtime\_get() call
for PWMs which are enabled at probe time to the pwm\_lpss\_probe() function;
and by making get\_state take a runtime-pm ref before reading the ctrl reg.

RISC-V: Don't mark init section as non-executable
commit 4e0f9e3a6104261f25b16fcab02fc96f5666ba11 upstream.
The head text section (i.e. \_start, secondary\_start\_sbi, etc) and the
init section fall under same page table level-1 mapping.
Currently, the runtime CPU hotplug is broken because we are marking
init section as non-executable which in-turn marks head text section
as non-executable.
Further investigating other architectures, it seems marking the init
section as non-executable is redundant because the init section pages
are anyway poisoned and freed.
To fix broken runtime CPU hotplug, we simply remove the code marking
the init section as non-executable.

block: nr\_sects\_write(): Disable preemption on seqcount write
commit 15b81ce5abdc4b502aa31dff2d415b79d2349d2f upstream.
For optimized block readers not holding a mutex, the "number of sectors"
64-bit value is protected from tearing on 32-bit architectures by a
sequence counter.
Disable preemption before entering that sequence counter's write side
critical section. Otherwise, the read side can preempt the write side
section and spin for the entire scheduler tick. If the reader belongs to
a real-time scheduling class, it can spin forever and the kernel will
livelock.

sunrpc: clean up properly in gss\_mech\_unregister()
commit 24c5efe41c29ee3e55bcf5a1c9f61ca8709622e8 upstream.
gss\_mech\_register() calls svcauth\_gss\_register\_pseudoflavor() for each

This is unbalanced and makes it impossible to reload the module.

sunrpc: svcauth\_gss\_register\_pseudoflavor must reject duplicate registrations.
commit d47a5dc2888fd1b94adf1553068b8dad76cec96c upstream.
There is no valid case for supporting duplicate pseudoflavor
registrations.
Currently the silent acceptance of such registrations is hiding a bug.
The rpcsec\_gss\_krb5 module registers 2 flavours but does not unregister
them, so if you load, unload, reload the module, it will happily
continue to use the old registration which now has pointers to the
memory were the module was originally loaded. This could lead to
unexpected results.
So disallow duplicate registrations.

powerpc/64s: Save FSCR to init\_task.thread.fscr after feature init
commit 912c0a7f2b5daa3cbb2bc10f303981e493de73bd upstream.
At boot the FSCR is initialised via one of two paths. On most systems
it's set to a hard coded value in \_\_init\_FSCR().
On newer skiboot systems we use the device tree CPU features binding,
where firmware can tell Linux what bits to set in FSCR (and HFSCR).
In both cases the value that's configured at boot is not propagated
into the init\_task.thread.fscr value prior to the initial fork of init
(pid 1), which means the value is not used by any processes other than
swapper (the idle task).
For the \_\_init\_FSCR() case this is OK, because the value in
init\_task.thread.fscr is initialised to something sensible. However it
does mean that the value set in \_\_init\_FSCR() is not used other than
for swapper, which is odd and confusing.
The bigger problem is for the device tree CPU features case it
prevents firmware from setting (or clearing) FSCR bits for use by user
space. This means all existing kernels can not have features
enabled/disabled by firmware if those features require
setting/clearing FSCR bits.
We can handle both cases by saving the FSCR value into
init\_task.thread.fscr after we have initialised it at boot. This fixes
the bug for device tree CPU features, and will allow us to simplify
the initialisation for the \_\_init\_FSCR() case in a future patch.

powerpc/64s: Don't let DT CPU features set FSCR\_DSCR
commit 993e3d96fd08c3ebf7566e43be9b8cd622063e6d upstream.
The device tree CPU features binding includes FSCR bit numbers which
Linux is instructed to set by firmware.
Whether that's a good idea or not, in the case of the DSCR the Linux
implementation has a hard requirement that the FSCR\_DSCR bit not be
set by default. We use it to track when a process reads/writes to
DSCR, so it must be clear to begin with.
So if firmware tells us to set FSCR\_DSCR we must ignore it.
Currently this does not cause a bug in our DSCR handling because the
value of FSCR that the device tree CPU features code establishes is
only used by swapper. All other tasks use the value hard coded in
init\_task.thread.fscr.
However we'd like to fix that in a future commit, at which point this
will become necessary.

powerpc/32: Disable KASAN with pages bigger than 16k
commit 888468ce725a4cd56d72dc7e5096078f7a9251a0 upstream.
Mapping of early shadow area is implemented by using a single static
page table having all entries pointing to the same early shadow page.
The shadow area must therefore occupy full PGD entries.
The shadow area has a size of 128MB starting at 0xf8000000.
With 4k pages, a PGD entry is 4MB
With 16k pages, a PGD entry is 64MB
With 64k pages, a PGD entry is 1GB which is too big.
Until we rework the early shadow mapping, disable KASAN when the page
size is too big.

powerpc/kasan: Fix issues by lowering KASAN\_SHADOW\_END
commit 3a66a24f6060e6775f8c02ac52329ea0152d7e58 upstream.
At the time being, KASAN\_SHADOW\_END is 0x100000000, which
is 0 in 32 bits representation.
This leads to a couple of issues:
- kasan\_remap\_early\_shadow\_ro() does nothing because the comparison
k\_cur < k\_end is always false.
- In ptdump, address comparison for markers display fails and the
marker's name is printed at the start of the KASAN area instead of
being printed at the end.
However, there is no need to shadow the KASAN shadow area itself,
so the KASAN shadow area can stop shadowing memory at the start
of itself.
With a PAGE\_OFFSET set to 0xc0000000, KASAN shadow area is then going
from 0xf8000000 to 0xff000000.

commit 85cb4e0bd229 ("ARM: dts: add cm36651 light/proximity sensor node

driver ignored the GPIO polarity specified in the device-tree.
The recent conversion of "i2c-gpio" driver to the new, descriptor based
GPIO API, automatically made it the DT-specified polarity aware, what
broke the CM36651 sensor operation.

jbd2: avoid leaking transaction credits when unreserving handle
commit 14ff6286309e2853aed50083c9a83328423fdd8c upstream.
When reserved transaction handle is unused, we subtract its reserved
credits in \_\_jbd2\_journal\_unreserve\_handle() called from
jbd2\_journal\_stop(). However this function forgets to remove reserved
credits from transaction->t\_outstanding\_credits and thus the transaction
space that was reserved remains effectively leaked. The leaked
transaction space can be quite significant in some cases and leads to
unnecessarily small transactions and thus reducing throughput of the
journalling machinery. E.g. fsmark workload creating lots of 4k files
was observed to have about 20% lower throughput due to this when ext4 is
mounted with dioread\_nolock mount option.
Subtract reserved credits from t\_outstanding\_credits as well.

ARM: tegra: Correct PL310 Auxiliary Control Register initialization
commit 35509737c8f958944e059d501255a0bf18361ba0 upstream.
The PL310 Auxiliary Control Register shouldn't have the "Full line of
zero" optimization bit being set before L2 cache is enabled. The L2X0
driver takes care of enabling the optimization by itself.
This patch fixes a noisy error message on Tegra20 and Tegra30 telling
that cache optimization is erroneously enabled without enabling it for

kernel/cpu\_pm: Fix uninitted local in cpu\_pm
commit b5945214b76a1f22929481724ffd448000ede914 upstream.
cpu\_pm\_notify() is basically a wrapper of notifier\_call\_chain().
notifier\_call\_chain() doesn't initialize \*nr\_calls to 0 before it
starts incrementing it--presumably it's up to the callers to do this.
Unfortunately the callers of cpu\_pm\_notify() don't init \*nr\_calls.
This potentially means you could get too many or two few calls to
CPU\_PM\_ENTER\_FAILED or CPU\_CLUSTER\_PM\_ENTER\_FAILED depending on the
luck of the stack.
Let's fix this.

powerpc/fadump: consider reserved ranges while reserving memory
commit 140777a3d8dfdb3d3f20ea7707c0f1c0ce1b0aa5 upstream.
Commit 0962e8004e97 ("powerpc/prom: Scan reserved-ranges node for
memory reservations") enabled support to parse reserved-ranges DT
node and reserve kernel memory falling in these ranges for F/W
purposes. Memory reserved for FADump should not overlap with these
ranges as it could corrupt memory meant for F/W or crash'ed kernel
memory to be exported as vmcore.
But since commit 579ca1a27675 ("powerpc/fadump: make use of memblock's
bottom up allocation mode"), memblock\_find\_in\_range() is being used to
find the appropriate area to reserve memory for FADump, which can't
account for reserved-ranges as these ranges are reserved only after
FADump memory reservation.
With reserved-ranges now being populated during early boot, look out
for these memory ranges while reserving memory for FADump. Without
this change, MPIPL on PowerNV systems aborts with hostboot failure,
when memory reserved for FADump is less than 4096MB.

alpha: fix memory barriers so that they conform to the specification
commit 54505a1e2083fc54cbe8779b97479f969cd30a00 upstream.
The commits cd0e00c10672 and 92d7223a7423 broke boot on the Alpha Avanti
platform. The patches move memory barriers after a write before the write.
The result is that if there's iowrite followed by ioread, there is no
barrier between them.
The Alpha architecture allows reordering of the accesses to the I/O space,
and the missing barrier between write and read causes hang with serial
port and real time clock.
This patch makes barriers confiorm to the specification.
1. We add mb() before readX\_relaxed and writeX\_relaxed -
memory-barriers.txt claims that these functions must be ordered w.r.t.
each other. Alpha doesn't order them, so we need an explicit barrier.
2. We add mb() before reads from the I/O space - so that if there's a
write followed by a read, there should be a barrier between them.

software node: implement software\_node\_unregister()

software\_node\_unregister() so that you can unregister them one at a

This is especially important when creating nodes in a hierarchy, with
parent -> children representations. Children always need to be removed
before a parent is, as the swnode logic assumes this is going to be the
case.

Currently, for EINT\_TYPE GPIOs, the CON and FLTCON registers
are saved and restored over a suspend/resume cycle. However, the
EINT\_MASK registers are not.
On S5PV210 at the very least, these registers are not retained over
suspend, leading to the interrupts remaining masked upon resume and
therefore no interrupts being triggered for the device. There should
be no effect on any SoCs that do retain these registers as theoretically
we would just be re-writing what was already there.

iommu/vt-d: Only clear real DMA device's context entries
commit 8038bdb8553313ad53bfcffcf8294dd0ab44618f upstream.
Domain context mapping can encounter issues with sub-devices of a real
DMA device. A sub-device cannot have a valid context entry due to it
potentially aliasing another device's 16-bit ID. It's expected that
sub-devices of the real DMA device uses the real DMA device's requester
when context mapping.
This is an issue when a sub-device is removed where the context entry is
cleared for all aliases. Other sub-devices are still valid, resulting in
those sub-devices being stranded without valid context entries.
The correct approach is to use the real DMA device when programming the
context entries. The insertion path is correct because device\_to\_iommu()
will return the bus and devfn of the real DMA device. The removal path
needs to only operate on the real DMA device, otherwise the entire
context entry would be cleared for all sub-devices of the real DMA
device.
This patch also adds a helper to determine if a struct device is a
sub-device of a real DMA device.

igb: Report speed and duplex as unknown when device is runtime suspended
commit 165ae7a8feb53dc47fb041357e4b253bfc927cf9 upstream.
igb device gets runtime suspended when there's no link partner. We can't
get correct speed under that state:
$ cat /sys/class/net/enp3s0/speed
1000
In addition to that, an error can also be spotted in dmesg:
[ 385.991957] igb 0000:03:00.0 enp3s0: PCIe link lost
Since device can only be runtime suspended when there's no link partner,
we can skip reading register and let the following logic set speed and
duplex with correct status.
The more generic approach will be wrap get\_link\_ksettings() with begin()
and complete() callbacks. However, for this particular issue, begin()
calls igb\_runtime\_resume() , which tries to rtnl\_lock() while the lock
is already hold by upper ethtool layer.
So let's take this approach until the igb\_runtime\_resume() no longer
needs to hold rtnl\_lock.

media: ov5640: fix use of destroyed mutex
commit bfcba38d95a0aed146a958a84a2177af1459eddc upstream.
v4l2\_ctrl\_handler\_free() uses hdl->lock, which in ov5640 driver is set
to sensor's own sensor->lock. In ov5640\_remove(), the driver destroys the
sensor->lock first, and then calls v4l2\_ctrl\_handler\_free(), resulting
in the use of the destroyed mutex.
Fix this by calling moving the mutex\_destroy() to the end of the cleanup
sequence, as there's no need to destroy the mutex as early as possible.

b43\_legacy: Fix connection problem with WPA3
commit 6a29d134c04a8acebb7a95251acea7ad7abba106 upstream.
Since the driver was first introduced into the kernel, it has only
handled the ciphers associated with WEP, WPA, and WPA2. It fails with
WPA3 even though mac80211 can handle those additional ciphers in software,
b43legacy did not report that it could handle them. By setting MFP\_CAPABLE using
ieee80211\_set\_hw(), the problem is fixed.
With this change, b43legacy will handle the ciphers it knows in hardware,
and let mac80211 handle the others in software. It is not necessary to
use the module parameter NOHWCRYPT to turn hardware encryption off.
Although this change essentially eliminates that module parameter,
I am choosing to keep it for cases where the hardware is broken,
and software encryption is required for all ciphers.

b43legacy: Fix case where channel status is corrupted
commit ec4d3e3a054578de34cd0b587ab8a1ac36f629d9 upstream.
This patch fixes commit 75388acd0cd8 ("add mac80211-based driver for
legacy BCM43xx devices")
In https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=207093, a defect in
b43legacy is reported. Upon testing, thus problem exists on PPC and
X86 platforms, is present in the oldest kernel tested (3.2), and
has been present in the driver since it was first added to the kernel.
The problem is a corrupted channel status received from the device.
Both the internal card in a PowerBook G4 and the PCMCIA version
(Broadcom BCM4306 with PCI ID 14e4:4320) have the problem. Only Rev, 2
(revision 4 of the 802.11 core) of the chip has been tested. No other
devices using b43legacy are available for testing.
Various sources of the problem were considered. Buffer overrun and
other sources of corruption within the driver were rejected because
the faulty channel status is always the same, not a random value.
It was concluded that the faulty data is coming from the device, probably
due to a firmware bug. As that source is not available, the driver
must take appropriate action to recover.
At present, the driver reports the error, and them continues to process
the bad packet. This is believed that to be a mistake, and the correct
action is to drop the correpted packet.

serial: 8250: Avoid error message on reprobe
commit e0a851fe6b9b619527bd928aa93caaddd003f70c upstream.
If the call to uart\_add\_one\_port() in serial8250\_register\_8250\_port()
fails, a half-initialized entry in the serial\_8250ports[] array is left
behind.
A subsequent reprobe of the same serial port causes that entry to be
reused. Because uart->port.dev is set, uart\_remove\_one\_port() is called
for the half-initialized entry and bails out with an error message:
bcm2835-aux-uart 3f215040.serial: Removing wrong port: (null) != (ptrval)
The same happens on failure of mctrl\_gpio\_init() since commit
4a96895f74c9 ("tty/serial/8250: use mctrl\_gpio helpers").
Fix by zeroing the uart->port.dev pointer in the probe error path.
The bug was introduced in v2.6.10 by historical commit befff6f5bf5f
("[SERIAL] Add new port registration/unregistration functions."):
https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/befff6f5bf5f
The commit added an unconditional call to uart\_remove\_one\_port() in
serial8250\_register\_port(). In v3.7, commit 835d844d1a28 ("8250\_pnp:
do pnp probe before legacy probe") made that call conditional on
uart->port.dev which allows me to fix the issue by zeroing that pointer
in the error path. Thus, the present commit will fix the problem as far
back as v3.7 whereas still older versions need to also cherry-pick
835d844d1a28.

media: cedrus: Program output format during each run
commit a8876c22eab9a871834f85de83e98bbf7e6e264d upstream.
Previously, the output format was programmed as part of the ioctl()
handler. However, this has two problems:
1) If there are multiple active streams with different output
formats, the hardware will use whichever format was set last
for both streams. Similarly, an ioctl() done in an inactive
context will wrongly affect other active contexts.
2) The registers are written while the device is not actively
streaming. To enable runtime PM tied to the streaming state,
all hardware access needs to be moved inside cedrus\_device\_run().
The call to cedrus\_dst\_format\_set() is now placed just before the
codec-specific callback that programs the hardware.

1. cpuhp\_setup\_state() is called multiple times
2. plic\_starting\_cpu() can crash for boot CPU if cpuhp\_setup\_state()

Address both issues by only initializing the HP notifiers when

Currently, the default irq affinity for each PLIC interrupt is all

e1000e: Relax condition to trigger reset for ME workaround
commit d601afcae2febc49665008e9a79e701248d56c50 upstream.
It's an error if the value of the RX/TX tail descriptor does not match
what was written. The error condition is true regardless the duration
of the interference from ME. But the driver only performs the reset if
E1000\_ICH\_FWSM\_PCIM2PCI\_COUNT (2000) iterations of 50us delay have
transpired. The extra condition can lead to inconsistency between the
state of hardware as expected by the driver.
Fix this by dropping the check for number of delay iterations.
While at it, also make \_\_ew32\_prepare() static as it's not used
anywhere else.

Instead, program the Max\_Payload\_Size of RCiEPs to the maximum supported

affects the subsequent programming of Max\_Read\_Request\_Size because Linux

PCI: Add ACS quirk for Intel Root Complex Integrated Endpoints
[ Upstream commit 3247bd10a4502a3075ce8e1c3c7d31ef76f193ce ]
All Intel platforms guarantee that all root complex implementations must
send transactions up to IOMMU for address translations. Hence for Intel
RCiEP devices, we can assume some ACS-type isolation even without an ACS
capability.
From the Intel VT-d spec, r3.1, sec 3.16 ("Root-Complex Peer to Peer
Considerations"):
When DMA remapping is enabled, peer-to-peer requests through the
Root-Complex must be handled as follows:
- The input address in the request is translated (through first-level,
second-level or nested translation) to a host physical address (HPA).
The address decoding for peer addresses must be done only on the
translated HPA. Hardware implementations are free to further limit
peer-to-peer accesses to specific host physical address regions (or
to completely disallow peer-forwarding of translated requests).
- Since address translation changes the contents (address field) of
the PCI Express Transaction Layer Packet (TLP), for PCI Express
peer-to-peer requests with ECRC, the Root-Complex hardware must use
the new ECRC (re-computed with the translated address) if it
decides to forward the TLP as a peer request.
- Root-ports, and multi-function root-complex integrated endpoints, may
support additional peer-to-peer control features by supporting PCI
Express Access Control Services (ACS) capability. Refer to ACS
capability in PCI Express specifications for details.
Since Linux didn't give special treatment to allow this exception, certain
RCiEP MFD devices were grouped in a single IOMMU group. This doesn't permit
a single device to be assigned to a guest for instance.
In one vendor system: Device 14.x were grouped in a single IOMMU group.
/sys/kernel/iommu\_groups/5/devices/0000:00:14.0
/sys/kernel/iommu\_groups/5/devices/0000:00:14.2
/sys/kernel/iommu\_groups/5/devices/0000:00:14.3
After this patch:
/sys/kernel/iommu\_groups/5/devices/0000:00:14.0
/sys/kernel/iommu\_groups/5/devices/0000:00:14.2
/sys/kernel/iommu\_groups/6/devices/0000:00:14.3 <<< new group
14.0 and 14.2 are integrated devices, but legacy end points, whereas 14.3
was a PCIe-compliant RCiEP.
00:14.3 Network controller: Intel Corporation Device 9df0 (rev 30)
Capabilities: [40] Express (v2) Root Complex Integrated Endpoint, MSI 00
This permits assigning this device to a guest VM.

PCI: Avoid FLR for AMD Starship USB 3.0
[ Upstream commit 5727043c73fdfe04597971b5f3f4850d879c1f4f ]
The AMD Starship USB 3.0 host controller advertises Function Level Reset
support, but it apparently doesn't work. Add a quirk to prevent use of FLR
on this device.
Without this quirk, when attempting to assign (pass through) an AMD
Starship USB 3.0 host controller to a guest OS, the system becomes
increasingly unresponsive over the course of several minutes, eventually
requiring a hard reset. Shortly after attempting to start the guest, I see
these messages:

ext4: fix race between ext4\_sync\_parent() and rename()
commit 08adf452e628b0e2ce9a01048cfbec52353703d7 upstream.
'igrab(d\_inode(dentry->d\_parent))' without holding dentry->d\_lock is
broken because without d\_lock, d\_parent can be concurrently changed due
to a rename(). Then if the old directory is immediately deleted, old
d\_parent->inode can be NULL. That causes a NULL dereference in igrab().
To fix this, use dget\_parent() to safely grab a reference to the parent
dentry, which pins the inode. This also eliminates the need to use
d\_find\_any\_alias() other than for the initial inode, as we no longer
throw away the dentry at each step.
This is an extremely hard race to hit, but it is possible. Adding a
udelay() in between the reads of ->d\_parent and its ->d\_inode makes it
reproducible on a no-journal filesystem using the following program:
#include
#include
int main()
{
if (fork()) {
for (;;) {
mkdir("dir1", 0700);
int fd = open("dir1/file", O\_RDWR|O\_CREAT|O\_SYNC);
write(fd, "X", 1);
close(fd);
}
} else {
mkdir("dir2", 0700);
for (;;) {
rename("dir1/file", "dir2/file");
rmdir("dir1");
}
}
}

ext4: fix buffer\_head refcnt leak when ext4\_iget() fails
commit 3bbd0ef26098d241dc59ee77ba14b7dab0df0786 upstream.
ext4\_orphan\_get() invokes ext4\_read\_inode\_bitmap(), which returns a
reference of the specified buffer\_head object to "bitmap\_bh" with
increased refcnt.
When ext4\_orphan\_get() returns, local variable "bitmap\_bh" becomes
invalid, so the refcount should be decreased to keep refcount balanced.
The reference counting issue happens in one exception handling path of
ext4\_orphan\_get(). When ext4\_iget() fails, the function forgets to
decrease the refcnt increased by ext4\_read\_inode\_bitmap(), causing a
refcnt leak.
Fix this issue by calling brelse() when ext4\_iget() fails.

ima: Switch to ima\_hash\_algo for boot aggregate
commit 6f1a1d103b48b1533a9c804e7a069e2c8e937ce7 upstream.
boot\_aggregate is the first entry of IMA measurement list. Its purpose is
to link pre-boot measurements to IMA measurements. As IMA was designed to
work with a TPM 1.2, the SHA1 PCR bank was always selected even if a
TPM 2.0 with support for stronger hash algorithms is available.
This patch first tries to find a PCR bank with the IMA default hash
algorithm. If it does not find it, it selects the SHA256 PCR bank for
TPM 2.0 and SHA1 for TPM 1.2. Ultimately, it selects SHA1 also for TPM 2.0
if the SHA256 PCR bank is not found.
If none of the PCR banks above can be found, boot\_aggregate file digest is
filled with zeros, as for TPM bypass, making it impossible to perform a
remote attestation of the system.

mm/pagealloc.c: call touch\_nmi\_watchdog() on max order boundaries in deferred init
commit 117003c32771df617acf66e140fbdbdeb0ac71f5 upstream.
Patch series "initialize deferred pages with interrupts enabled", v4.
Keep interrupts enabled during deferred page initialization in order to
make code more modular and allow jiffies to update.
Original approach, and discussion can be found here:
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200311123848.118638-1-shile.zhang@linux.alibaba.com
This patch (of 3):
deferred\_init\_memmap() disables interrupts the entire time, so it calls
touch\_nmi\_watchdog() periodically to avoid soft lockup splats. Soon it
will run with interrupts enabled, at which point cond\_resched() should be
used instead.
deferred\_grow\_zone() makes the same watchdog calls through code shared
with deferred init but will continue to run with interrupts disabled, so
it can't call cond\_resched().
Pull the watchdog calls up to these two places to allow the first to be
changed later, independently of the second. The frequency reduces from
twice per pageblock (init and free) to once per max order block.

mm: initialize deferred pages with interrupts enabled
commit 3d060856adfc59afb9d029c233141334cfaba418 upstream.
Initializing struct pages is a long task and keeping interrupts disabled
for the duration of this operation introduces a number of problems.
1. jiffies are not updated for long period of time, and thus incorrect time
is reported. See proposed solution and discussion here:
lkml/20200311123848.118638-1-shile.zhang@linux.alibaba.com
2. It prevents farther improving deferred page initialization by allowing
intra-node multi-threading.
We are keeping interrupts disabled to solve a rather theoretical problem
that was never observed in real world (See 3a2d7fa8a3d5).
Let's keep interrupts enabled. In case we ever encounter a scenario where
an interrupt thread wants to allocate large amount of memory this early in
boot we can deal with that by growing zone (see deferred\_grow\_zone()) by
the needed amount before starting deferred\_init\_memmap() threads.

mm: thp: make the THP mapcount atomic against \_\_split\_huge\_pmd\_locked()
commit c444eb564fb16645c172d550359cb3d75fe8a040 upstream.
Write protect anon page faults require an accurate mapcount to decide
if to break the COW or not. This is implemented in the THP path with
reuse\_swap\_page() ->
page\_trans\_huge\_map\_swapcount()/page\_trans\_huge\_mapcount().
If the COW triggers while the other processes sharing the page are
under a huge pmd split, to do an accurate reading, we must ensure the
mapcount isn't computed while it's being transferred from the head
page to the tail pages.
reuse\_swap\_cache() already runs serialized by the page lock, so it's
enough to add the page lock around \_\_split\_huge\_pmd\_locked too, in
order to add the missing serialization.
Note: the commit in "Fixes" is just to facilitate the backporting,
because the code before such commit didn't try to do an accurate THP
mapcount calculation and it instead used the page\_count() to decide if
to COW or not. Both the page\_count and the pin\_count are THP-wide
refcounts, so they're inaccurate if used in
reuse\_swap\_page(). Reverting such commit (besides the unrelated fix to
the local anon\_vma assignment) would have also opened the window for
memory corruption side effects to certain workloads as documented in
such commit header.

btrfs: fix space\_info bytes\_may\_use underflow during space cache writeout
commit 2166e5edce9ac1edf3b113d6091ef72fcac2d6c4 upstream.
We always preallocate a data extent for writing a free space cache, which
causes writeback to always try the nocow path first, since the free space
inode has the prealloc bit set in its flags.
However if the block group that contains the data extent for the space
cache has been turned to RO mode due to a running scrub or balance for
example, we have to fallback to the cow path. In that case once a new data
extent is allocated we end up calling btrfs\_add\_reserved\_bytes(), which
decrements the counter named bytes\_may\_use from the data space\_info object
with the expection that this counter was previously incremented with the
same amount (the size of the data extent).
However when we started writeout of the space cache at cache\_save\_setup(),
we incremented the value of the bytes\_may\_use counter through a call to
btrfs\_check\_data\_free\_space() and then decremented it through a call to
btrfs\_prealloc\_file\_range\_trans() immediately after. So when starting the
writeback if we fallback to cow mode we have to increment the counter
bytes\_may\_use of the data space\_info again to compensate for the extent
allocation done by the cow path.
When this issue happens we are incorrectly decrementing the bytes\_may\_use
counter and when its current value is smaller then the amount we try to
subtract we end up with the following warning:

So fix this by incrementing the bytes\_may\_use counter of the data
space\_info when we fallback to the cow path. If the cow path is successful
the counter is decremented after extent allocation (by
btrfs\_add\_reserved\_bytes()), if it fails it ends up being decremented as
well when clearing the delalloc range (extent\_clear\_unlock\_delalloc()).
This could be triggered sporadically by the test case btrfs/061 from
fstests.

btrfs: fix space\_info bytes\_may\_use underflow after nocow buffered write
commit 467dc47ea99c56e966e99d09dae54869850abeeb upstream.
When doing a buffered write we always try to reserve data space for it,
even when the file has the NOCOW bit set or the write falls into a file
range covered by a prealloc extent. This is done both because it is
expensive to check if we can do a nocow write (checking if an extent is
shared through reflinks or if there's a hole in the range for example),
and because when writeback starts we might actually need to fallback to
COW mode (for example the block group containing the target extents was
turned into RO mode due to a scrub or balance).
When we are unable to reserve data space we check if we can do a nocow
write, and if we can, we proceed with dirtying the pages and setting up
the range for delalloc. In this case the bytes\_may\_use counter of the
data space\_info object is not incremented, unlike in the case where we
are able to reserve data space (done through btrfs\_check\_data\_free\_space()
which calls btrfs\_alloc\_data\_chunk\_ondemand()).
Later when running delalloc we attempt to start writeback in nocow mode
but we might revert back to cow mode, for example because in the meanwhile
a block group was turned into RO mode by a scrub or relocation. The cow
path after successfully allocating an extent ends up calling
btrfs\_add\_reserved\_bytes(), which expects the bytes\_may\_use counter of
the data space\_info object to have been incremented before - but we did
not do it when the buffered write started, since there was not enough
available data space. So btrfs\_add\_reserved\_bytes() ends up decrementing
the bytes\_may\_use counter anyway, and when the counter's current value
is smaller then the size of the allocated extent we get a stack trace
like the following:

So to fix this, when falling back into cow mode check if space was not
reserved, by testing for the bit EXTENT\_NORESERVE in the respective file
range, and if not, increment the bytes\_may\_use counter for the data
space\_info object. Also clear the EXTENT\_NORESERVE bit from the range, so
that if the cow path fails it decrements the bytes\_may\_use counter when
clearing the delalloc range (through the btrfs\_clear\_delalloc\_extent()
callback).

btrfs: fix wrong file range cleanup after an error filling dealloc range
commit e2c8e92d1140754073ad3799eb6620c76bab2078 upstream.
If an error happens while running dellaloc in COW mode for a range, we can
end up calling extent\_clear\_unlock\_delalloc() for a range that goes beyond
our range's end offset by 1 byte, which affects 1 extra page. This results
in clearing bits and doing page operations (such as a page unlock) outside
our target range.
Fix that by calling extent\_clear\_unlock\_delalloc() with an inclusive end
offset, instead of an exclusive end offset, at cow\_file\_range().

btrfs: fix corrupt log due to concurrent fsync of inodes with shared extents
commit e289f03ea79bbc6574b78ac25682555423a91cbb upstream.
When we have extents shared amongst different inodes in the same subvolume,
if we fsync them in parallel we can end up with checksum items in the log
tree that represent ranges which overlap.
For example, consider we have inodes A and B, both sharing an extent that
covers the logical range from X to X + 64KiB:
1) Task A starts an fsync on inode A;
2) Task B starts an fsync on inode B;
3) Task A calls btrfs\_csum\_file\_blocks(), and the first search in the
log tree, through btrfs\_lookup\_csum(), returns -EFBIG because it
finds an existing checksum item that covers the range from X - 64KiB
to X;
4) Task A checks that the checksum item has not reached the maximum
possible size (MAX\_CSUM\_ITEMS) and then releases the search path
before it does another path search for insertion (through a direct
call to btrfs\_search\_slot());
5) As soon as task A releases the path and before it does the search
for insertion, task B calls btrfs\_csum\_file\_blocks() and gets -EFBIG
too, because there is an existing checksum item that has an end
offset that matches the start offset (X) of the checksum range we want
to log;
6) Task B releases the path;
7) Task A does the path search for insertion (through btrfs\_search\_slot())
and then verifies that the checksum item that ends at offset X still
exists and extends its size to insert the checksums for the range from
X to X + 64KiB;
8) Task A releases the path and returns from btrfs\_csum\_file\_blocks(),
having inserted the checksums into an existing checksum item that got
its size extended. At this point we have one checksum item in the log
tree that covers the logical range from X - 64KiB to X + 64KiB;
9) Task B now does a search for insertion using btrfs\_search\_slot() too,
but it finds that the previous checksum item no longer ends at the
offset X, it now ends at an of offset X + 64KiB, so it leaves that item
untouched.
Then it releases the path and calls btrfs\_insert\_empty\_item()
that inserts a checksum item with a key offset corresponding to X and
a size for inserting a single checksum (4 bytes in case of crc32c).
Subsequent iterations end up extending this new checksum item so that
it contains the checksums for the range from X to X + 64KiB.
So after task B returns from btrfs\_csum\_file\_blocks() we end up with
two checksum items in the log tree that have overlapping ranges, one
for the range from X - 64KiB to X + 64KiB, and another for the range
from X to X + 64KiB.
Having checksum items that represent ranges which overlap, regardless of
being in the log tree or in the chekcsums tree, can lead to problems where
checksums for a file range end up not being found. This type of problem
has happened a few times in the past and the following commits fixed them
and explain in detail why having checksum items with overlapping ranges is
problematic:
27b9a8122ff71a "Btrfs: fix csum tree corruption, duplicate and outdated checksums"
b84b8390d6009c "Btrfs: fix file read corruption after extent cloning and fsync"
40e046acbd2f36 "Btrfs: fix missing data checksums after replaying a log tree"
Since this specific instance of the problem can only happen when logging
inodes, because it is the only case where concurrent attempts to insert
checksums for the same range can happen, fix the issue by using an extent
io tree as a range lock to serialize checksum insertion during inode
logging.
This issue could often be reproduced by the test case generic/457 from
fstests. When it happens it produces the following trace:

btrfs: fix error handling when submitting direct I/O bio
commit 6d3113a193e3385c72240096fe397618ecab6e43 upstream.
In btrfs\_submit\_direct\_hook(), if a direct I/O write doesn't span a RAID
stripe or chunk, we submit orig\_bio without cloning it. In this case, we
don't increment pending\_bios. Then, if btrfs\_submit\_dio\_bio() fails, we
decrement pending\_bios to -1, and we never complete orig\_bio. Fix it by
initializing pending\_bios to 1 instead of incrementing later.
Fixing this exposes another bug: we put orig\_bio prematurely and then
put it again from end\_io. Fix it by not putting orig\_bio.
After this change, pending\_bios is really more of a reference count, but
I'll leave that cleanup separate to keep the fix small.

orphan reloc roots are going to be cleaned up.

[FIX]
The fix is to clear fs\_root->reloc\_root and put it at
merge\_reloc\_roots() time, so that we won't leak reloc roots.

btrfs: force chunk allocation if our global rsv is larger than metadata
commit 9c343784c4328781129bcf9e671645f69fe4b38a upstream.
Nikolay noticed a bunch of test failures with my global rsv steal
patches. At first he thought they were introduced by them, but they've
been failing for a while with 64k nodes.
The problem is with 64k nodes we have a global reserve that calculates
out to 13MiB on a freshly made file system, which only has 8MiB of
metadata space. Because of changes I previously made we no longer
account for the global reserve in the overcommit logic, which means we
correctly allow overcommit to happen even though we are already
overcommitted.
However in some corner cases, for example btrfs/170, we will allocate
the entire file system up with data chunks before we have enough space
pressure to allocate a metadata chunk. Then once the fs is full we
ENOSPC out because we cannot overcommit and the global reserve is taking
up all of the available space.
The most ideal way to deal with this is to change our space reservation
stuff to take into account the height of the tree's that we're
modifying, so that our global reserve calculation does not end up so
obscenely large.
However that is a huge undertaking. Instead fix this by forcing a chunk
allocation if the global reserve is larger than the total metadata
space. This gives us essentially the same behavior that happened
before, we get a chunk allocated and these tests can pass.
This is meant to be a stop-gap measure until we can tackle the "tree
height only" project.

btrfs: send: emit file capabilities after chown
commit 89efda52e6b6930f80f5adda9c3c9edfb1397191 upstream.
Whenever a chown is executed, all capabilities of the file being touched
are lost. When doing incremental send with a file with capabilities,
there is a situation where the capability can be lost on the receiving
side. The sequence of actions bellow shows the problem:
$ mount /dev/sda fs1
$ mount /dev/sdb fs2
$ touch fs1/foo.bar
$ setcap cap\_sys\_nice+ep fs1/foo.bar
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r fs1 fs1/snap\_init
$ btrfs send fs1/snap\_init | btrfs receive fs2
$ chgrp adm fs1/foo.bar
$ setcap cap\_sys\_nice+ep fs1/foo.bar
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r fs1 fs1/snap\_complete
$ btrfs subvolume snapshot -r fs1 fs1/snap\_incremental
$ btrfs send fs1/snap\_complete | btrfs receive fs2
$ btrfs send -p fs1/snap\_init fs1/snap\_incremental | btrfs receive fs2
At this point, only a chown was emitted by "btrfs send" since only the
group was changed. This makes the cap\_sys\_nice capability to be dropped
from fs2/snap\_incremental/foo.bar
To fix that, only emit capabilities after chown is emitted. The current
code first checks for xattrs that are new/changed, emits them, and later
emit the chown. Now, \_\_process\_new\_xattr skips capabilities, letting
only finish\_inode\_if\_needed to emit them, if they exist, for the inode
being processed.
This behavior was being worked around in "btrfs receive" side by caching
the capability and only applying it after chown. Now, xattrs are only
emmited \_after\_ chown, making that workaround not needed anymore.

btrfs: fix a race between scrub and block group removal/allocation
commit 2473d24f2b77da0ffabcbb916793e58e7f57440b upstream.
When scrub is verifying the extents of a block group for a device, it is
possible that the corresponding block group gets removed and its logical
address and device extents get used for a new block group allocation.
When this happens scrub incorrectly reports that errors were detected
and, if the the new block group has a different profile then the old one,
deleted block group, we can crash due to a null pointer dereference.
Possibly other unexpected and weird consequences can happen as well.
Consider the following sequence of actions that leads to the null pointer
dereference crash when scrub is running in parallel with balance:
1) Balance sets block group X to read-only mode and starts relocating it.
Block group X is a metadata block group, has a raid1 profile (two
device extents, each one in a different device) and a logical address
of 19424870400;
2) Scrub is running and finds device extent E, which belongs to block
group X. It enters scrub\_stripe() to find all extents allocated to
block group X, the search is done using the extent tree;
3) Balance finishes relocating block group X and removes block group X;
4) Balance starts relocating another block group and when trying to
commit the current transaction as part of the preparation step
(prepare\_to\_relocate()), it blocks because scrub is running;
5) The scrub task finds the metadata extent at the logical address
19425001472 and marks the pages of the extent to be read by a bio
(struct scrub\_bio). The extent item's flags, which have the bit
BTRFS\_EXTENT\_FLAG\_TREE\_BLOCK set, are added to each page (struct
scrub\_page). It is these flags in the scrub pages that tells the
bio's end io function (scrub\_bio\_end\_io\_worker) which type of extent
it is dealing with. At this point we end up with 4 pages in a bio
which is ready for submission (the metadata extent has a size of
16Kb, so that gives 4 pages on x86);
6) At the next iteration of scrub\_stripe(), scrub checks that there is a
pause request from the relocation task trying to commit a transaction,
therefore it submits the pending bio and pauses, waiting for the
transaction commit to complete before resuming;
7) The relocation task commits the transaction. The device extent E, that
was used by our block group X, is now available for allocation, since
the commit root for the device tree was swapped by the transaction
commit;
8) Another task doing a direct IO write allocates a new data block group Y
which ends using device extent E. This new block group Y also ends up
getting the same logical address that block group X had: 19424870400.
This happens because block group X was the block group with the highest
logical address and, when allocating Y, find\_next\_chunk() returns the
end offset of the current last block group to be used as the logical
address for the new block group, which is
18351128576 + 1073741824 = 19424870400
So our new block group Y has the same logical address and device extent
that block group X had. However Y is a data block group, while X was
a metadata one, and Y has a raid0 profile, while X had a raid1 profile;
9) After allocating block group Y, the direct IO submits a bio to write
to device extent E;
10) The read bio submitted by scrub reads the 4 pages (16Kb) from device
extent E, which now correspond to the data written by the task that
did a direct IO write. Then at the end io function associated with
the bio, scrub\_bio\_end\_io\_worker(), we call scrub\_block\_complete()
which calls scrub\_checksum(). This later function checks the flags
of the first page, and sees that the bit BTRFS\_EXTENT\_FLAG\_TREE\_BLOCK
is set in the flags, so it assumes it has a metadata extent and
then calls scrub\_checksum\_tree\_block(). That functions returns an
error, since interpreting data as a metadata extent causes the
checksum verification to fail.
So this makes scrub\_checksum() call scrub\_handle\_errored\_block(),
which determines 'failed\_mirror\_index' to be 1, since the device
extent E was allocated as the second mirror of block group X.
It allocates BTRFS\_MAX\_MIRRORS scrub\_block structures as an array at
'sblocks\_for\_recheck', and all the memory is initialized to zeroes by
kcalloc().
After that it calls scrub\_setup\_recheck\_block(), which is responsible
for filling each of those structures. However, when that function
calls btrfs\_map\_sblock() against the logical address of the metadata
extent, 19425001472, it gets a struct btrfs\_bio ('bbio') that matches
the current block group Y. However block group Y has a raid0 profile
and not a raid1 profile like X had, so the following call returns 1:
scrub\_nr\_raid\_mirrors(bbio)
And as a result scrub\_setup\_recheck\_block() only initializes the
first (index 0) scrub\_block structure in 'sblocks\_for\_recheck'.
Then scrub\_recheck\_block() is called by scrub\_handle\_errored\_block()
with the second (index 1) scrub\_block structure as the argument,
because 'failed\_mirror\_index' was previously set to 1.
This scrub\_block was not initialized by scrub\_setup\_recheck\_block(),
so it has zero pages, its 'page\_count' member is 0 and its 'pagev'
page array has all members pointing to NULL.
Finally when scrub\_recheck\_block() calls scrub\_recheck\_block\_checksum()
we have a NULL pointer dereference when accessing the flags of the first
page, as pavev[0] is NULL:
static void scrub\_recheck\_block\_checksum(struct scrub\_block \*sblock)
{
(...)
if (sblock->pagev[0]->flags & BTRFS\_EXTENT\_FLAG\_DATA)
scrub\_checksum\_data(sblock);
(...)
}

This issue has been around for a long time, possibly since scrub exists.
The last time I ran into it was over 2 years ago. After recently fixing
fstests to pass the "--full-balance" command line option to btrfs-progs
when doing balance, several tests started to more heavily exercise balance
with fsstress, scrub and other operations in parallel, and therefore
started to hit this issue again (with btrfs/061 for example).
Fix this by having scrub increment the 'trimming' counter of the block
group, which pins the block group in such a way that it guarantees neither
its logical address nor device extents can be reused by future block group
allocations until we decrement the 'trimming' counter. Also make sure that
on each iteration of scrub\_stripe() we stop scrubbing the block group if
it was removed already.
A later patch in the series will rename the block group's 'trimming'
counter and its helpers to a more generic name, since now it is not used
exclusively for pinning while trimming anymore.

btrfs: include non-missing as a qualifier for the latest\_bdev
commit 998a0671961f66e9fad4990ed75f80ba3088c2f1 upstream.
btrfs\_free\_extra\_devids() updates fs\_devices::latest\_bdev to point to
the bdev with greatest device::generation number. For a typical-missing
device the generation number is zero so fs\_devices::latest\_bdev will
never point to it.
But if the missing device is due to alienation [1], then
device::generation is not zero and if it is greater or equal to the rest
of device generations in the list, then fs\_devices::latest\_bdev ends up
pointing to the missing device and reports the error like [2].
[1] We maintain devices of a fsid (as in fs\_device::fsid) in the
fs\_devices::devices list, a device is considered as an alien device
if its fsid does not match with the fs\_device::fsid
Consider a working filesystem with raid1:
$ mkfs.btrfs -f -d raid1 -m raid1 /dev/sda /dev/sdb
$ mount /dev/sda /mnt-raid1
$ umount /mnt-raid1
While mnt-raid1 was unmounted the user force-adds one of its devices to
another btrfs filesystem:
$ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdc
$ mount /dev/sdc /mnt-single
$ btrfs dev add -f /dev/sda /mnt-single
Now the original mnt-raid1 fails to mount in degraded mode, because
fs\_devices::latest\_bdev is pointing to the alien device.
$ mount -o degraded /dev/sdb /mnt-raid1
[2]
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb,
missing codepage or helper program, or other error
In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
dmesg | tail or so.

Fix the root cause by checking if the device is not missing before it

btrfs: free alien device after device add
commit 7f551d969037cc128eca60688d9c5a300d84e665 upstream.
When an old device has new fsid through 'btrfs device add -f ' our
fs\_devices list has an alien device in one of the fs\_devices lists.
By having an alien device in fs\_devices, we have two issues so far
1. missing device does not not show as missing in the userland
2. degraded mount will fail
Both issues are caused by the fact that there's an alien device in the
fs\_devices list. (Alien means that it does not belong to the filesystem,
identified by fsid, or does not contain btrfs filesystem at all, eg. due
to overwrite).
A device can be scanned/added through the control device ioctls
SCAN\_DEV, DEVICES\_READY or by ADD\_DEV.
And device coming through the control device is checked against the all
other devices in the lists, but this was not the case for ADD\_DEV.
This patch fixes both issues above by removing the alien device.

string.h: fix incompatibility between FORTIFY\_SOURCE and KASAN
[ Upstream commit 47227d27e2fcb01a9e8f5958d8997cf47a820afc ]
The memcmp KASAN self-test fails on a kernel with both KASAN and
FORTIFY\_SOURCE.
When FORTIFY\_SOURCE is on, a number of functions are replaced with
fortified versions, which attempt to check the sizes of the operands.
However, these functions often directly invoke \_\_builtin\_foo() once they
have performed the fortify check. Using \_\_builtins may bypass KASAN
checks if the compiler decides to inline it's own implementation as
sequence of instructions, rather than emit a function call that goes out
to a KASAN-instrumented implementation.
Why is only memcmp affected?
============================
Of the string and string-like functions that kasan\_test tests, only memcmp
is replaced by an inline sequence of instructions in my testing on x86
with gcc version 9.2.1 20191008 (Ubuntu 9.2.1-9ubuntu2).
I believe this is due to compiler heuristics. For example, if I annotate
kmalloc calls with the alloc\_size annotation (and disable some fortify
compile-time checking!), the compiler will replace every memset except the
one in kmalloc\_uaf\_memset with inline instructions. (I have some WIP
patches to add this annotation.)
Does this affect other functions in string.h?
=============================================
Yes. Anything that uses \_\_builtin\_\* rather than \_\_real\_\* could be
affected. This looks like:
- strncpy
- strcat
- strlen
- strlcpy maybe, under some circumstances?
- strncat under some circumstances
- memset
- memcpy
- memmove
- memcmp (as noted)
- memchr
- strcpy
Whether a function call is emitted always depends on the compiler. Most
bugs should get caught by FORTIFY\_SOURCE, but the missed memcmp test shows
that this is not always the case.
Isn't FORTIFY\_SOURCE disabled with KASAN?
========================================-
The string headers on all arches supporting KASAN disable fortify with
kasan, but only when address sanitisation is \_also\_ disabled. For example
from x86:
#if defined(CONFIG\_KASAN) && !defined(\_\_SANITIZE\_ADDRESS\_\_)
/\*
\* For files that are not instrumented (e.g. mm/slub.c) we
\* should use not instrumented version of mem\* functions.
\*/
#define memcpy(dst, src, len) \_\_memcpy(dst, src, len)
#define memmove(dst, src, len) \_\_memmove(dst, src, len)
#define memset(s, c, n) \_\_memset(s, c, n)
#ifndef \_\_NO\_FORTIFY
#define \_\_NO\_FORTIFY /\* FORTIFY\_SOURCE uses \_\_builtin\_memcpy, etc. \*/
#endif
#endif
This comes from commit 6974f0c4555e ("include/linux/string.h: add the
option of fortified string.h functions"), and doesn't work when KASAN is
enabled and the file is supposed to be sanitised - as with test\_kasan.c
I'm pretty sure this is not wrong, but not as expansive it should be:
\* we shouldn't use \_\_builtin\_memcpy etc in files where we don't have
instrumentation - it could devolve into a function call to memcpy,
which will be instrumented. Rather, we should use \_\_memcpy which
by convention is not instrumented.
\* we also shouldn't be using \_\_builtin\_memcpy when we have a KASAN
instrumented file, because it could be replaced with inline asm
that will not be instrumented.
What is correct behaviour?
==========================
Firstly, there is some overlap between fortification and KASAN: both
provide some level of \_runtime\_ checking. Only fortify provides
compile-time checking.
KASAN and fortify can pick up different things at runtime:
- Some fortify functions, notably the string functions, could easily be
modified to consider sub-object sizes (e.g. members within a struct),
and I have some WIP patches to do this. KASAN cannot detect these
because it cannot insert poision between members of a struct.
- KASAN can detect many over-reads/over-writes when the sizes of both
operands are unknown, which fortify cannot.
So there are a couple of options:
1) Flip the test: disable fortify in santised files and enable it in
unsanitised files. This at least stops us missing KASAN checking, but
we lose the fortify checking.
2) Make the fortify code always call out to real versions. Do this only
for KASAN, for fear of losing the inlining opportunities we get from
\_\_builtin\_\*.
(We can't use kasan\_check\_{read,write}: because the fortify functions are
\_extern inline\_, you can't include \_static\_ inline functions without a
compiler warning. kasan\_check\_{read,write} are static inline so we can't
use them even when they would otherwise be suitable.)
Take approach 2 and call out to real versions when KASAN is enabled.
Use \_\_underlying\_foo to distinguish from \_\_real\_foo: \_\_real\_foo always
refers to the kernel's implementation of foo, \_\_underlying\_foo could be
either the kernel implementation or the \_\_builtin\_foo implementation.
This is sometimes enough to make the memcmp test succeed with
FORTIFY\_SOURCE enabled. It is at least enough to get the function call
into the module. One more fix is needed to make it reliable: see the next
patch.

kasan: stop tests being eliminated as dead code with FORTIFY\_SOURCE
[ Upstream commit adb72ae1915db28f934e9e02c18bfcea2f3ed3b7 ]
Patch series "Fix some incompatibilites between KASAN and FORTIFY\_SOURCE", v4.
3 KASAN self-tests fail on a kernel with both KASAN and FORTIFY\_SOURCE:
memchr, memcmp and strlen.
When FORTIFY\_SOURCE is on, a number of functions are replaced with
fortified versions, which attempt to check the sizes of the operands.
However, these functions often directly invoke \_\_builtin\_foo() once they
have performed the fortify check. The compiler can detect that the
results of these functions are not used, and knows that they have no other
side effects, and so can eliminate them as dead code.
Why are only memchr, memcmp and strlen affected?
================================================
Of string and string-like functions, kasan\_test tests:
\* strchr -> not affected, no fortified version
\* strrchr -> likewise
\* strcmp -> likewise
\* strncmp -> likewise
\* strnlen -> not affected, the fortify source implementation calls the
underlying strnlen implementation which is instrumented, not
a builtin
\* strlen -> affected, the fortify souce implementation calls a \_\_builtin
version which the compiler can determine is dead.
\* memchr -> likewise
\* memcmp -> likewise
\* memset -> not affected, the compiler knows that memset writes to its
first argument and therefore is not dead.
Why does this not affect the functions normally?
================================================
In string.h, these functions are not marked as \_\_pure, so the compiler
cannot know that they do not have side effects. If relevant functions are
marked as \_\_pure in string.h, we see the following warnings and the
functions are elided:
lib/test\_kasan.c: In function `kasan\_memchr':
lib/test\_kasan.c:606:2: warning: statement with no effect [-Wunused-value]
memchr(ptr, '1', size + 1);
^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
lib/test\_kasan.c: In function `kasan\_memcmp':
lib/test\_kasan.c:622:2: warning: statement with no effect [-Wunused-value]
memcmp(ptr, arr, size+1);
^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
lib/test\_kasan.c: In function `kasan\_strings':
lib/test\_kasan.c:645:2: warning: statement with no effect [-Wunused-value]
strchr(ptr, '1');
^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
...
This annotation would make sense to add and could be added at any point,
so the behaviour of test\_kasan.c should change.
The fix
=======
Make all the functions that are pure write their results to a global,
which makes them live. The strlen and memchr tests now pass.
The memcmp test still fails to trigger, which is addressed in the next
patch.

Certain kernel functions (e.g. get\_vtimer/set\_vtimer) cause kernel
panic when the stack is not 8-byte aligned. Currently JITed BPF programs
may trigger this by allocating stack frames with non-rounded sizes and
then being interrupted. Fix by using rounded fp->aux->stack\_depth.

bpf: Fix up bpf\_skb\_adjust\_room helper's skb csum setting
[ Upstream commit 836e66c218f355ec01ba57671c85abf32961dcea ]
Lorenz recently reported:
In our TC classifier cls\_redirect [0], we use the following sequence of
helper calls to decapsulate a GUE (basically IP + UDP + custom header)
encapsulated packet:
bpf\_skb\_adjust\_room(skb, -encap\_len, BPF\_ADJ\_ROOM\_MAC, BPF\_F\_ADJ\_ROOM\_FIXED\_GSO)
bpf\_redirect(skb->ifindex, BPF\_F\_INGRESS)
It seems like some checksums of the inner headers are not validated in
this case. For example, a TCP SYN packet with invalid TCP checksum is
still accepted by the network stack and elicits a SYN ACK. [...]
That is, we receive the following packet from the driver:
| ETH | IP | UDP | GUE | IP | TCP |
skb->ip\_summed == CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY
ip\_summed is CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY because our NICs do rx checksum offloading.
On this packet we run skb\_adjust\_room\_mac(-encap\_len), and get the following:
| ETH | IP | TCP |
skb->ip\_summed == CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY
Note that ip\_summed is still CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY. After bpf\_redirect()'ing
into the ingress, we end up in tcp\_v4\_rcv(). There, skb\_checksum\_init() is
turned into a no-op due to CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY.
The bpf\_skb\_adjust\_room() helper is not aware of protocol specifics. Internally,
it handles the CHECKSUM\_COMPLETE case via skb\_postpull\_rcsum(), but that does
not cover CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY. In this case skb->csum\_level of the original
skb prior to bpf\_skb\_adjust\_room() call was 0, that is, covering UDP. Right now
there is no way to adjust the skb->csum\_level. NICs that have checksum offload
disabled (CHECKSUM\_NONE) or that support CHECKSUM\_COMPLETE are not affected.
Use a safe default for CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY by resetting to CHECKSUM\_NONE and
add a flag to the helper called BPF\_F\_ADJ\_ROOM\_NO\_CSUM\_RESET that allows users
from opting out. Opting out is useful for the case where we don't remove/add
full protocol headers, or for the case where a user wants to adjust the csum
level manually e.g. through bpf\_csum\_level() helper that is added in subsequent
patch.
The bpf\_skb\_proto\_{4\_to\_6,6\_to\_4}() for NAT64/46 translation from the BPF
bpf\_skb\_change\_proto() helper uses bpf\_skb\_net\_hdr\_{push,pop}() pair internally
as well but doesn't change layers, only transitions between v4 to v6 and vice
versa, therefore no adoption is required there.

bpf: Fix running sk\_skb program types with ktls
[ Upstream commit e91de6afa81c10e9f855c5695eb9a53168d96b73 ]
KTLS uses a stream parser to collect TLS messages and send them to
the upper layer tls receive handler. This ensures the tls receiver
has a full TLS header to parse when it is run. However, when a
socket has BPF\_SK\_SKB\_STREAM\_VERDICT program attached before KTLS
is enabled we end up with two stream parsers running on the same
socket.
The result is both try to run on the same socket. First the KTLS
stream parser runs and calls read\_sock() which will tcp\_read\_sock
which in turn calls tcp\_rcv\_skb(). This dequeues the skb from the
sk\_receive\_queue. When this is done KTLS code then data\_ready()
callback which because we stacked KTLS on top of the bpf stream
verdict program has been replaced with sk\_psock\_start\_strp(). This
will in turn kick the stream parser again and eventually do the
same thing KTLS did above calling into tcp\_rcv\_skb() and dequeuing
a skb from the sk\_receive\_queue.
At this point the data stream is broke. Part of the stream was
handled by the KTLS side some other bytes may have been handled
by the BPF side. Generally this results in either missing data
or more likely a "Bad Message" complaint from the kTLS receive
handler as the BPF program steals some bytes meant to be in a
TLS header and/or the TLS header length is no longer correct.
We've already broke the idealized model where we can stack ULPs
in any order with generic callbacks on the TX side to handle this.
So in this patch we do the same thing but for RX side. We add
a sk\_psock\_strp\_enabled() helper so TLS can learn a BPF verdict
program is running and add a tls\_sw\_has\_ctx\_rx() helper so BPF
side can learn there is a TLS ULP on the socket.
Then on BPF side we omit calling our stream parser to avoid
breaking the data stream for the KTLS receiver. Then on the
KTLS side we call BPF\_SK\_SKB\_STREAM\_VERDICT once the KTLS
receiver is done with the packet but before it posts the
msg to userspace. This gives us symmetry between the TX and
RX halfs and IMO makes it usable again. On the TX side we
process packets in this order BPF -> TLS -> TCP and on
the receive side in the reverse order TCP -> TLS -> BPF.

platform/x86: asus\_wmi: Reserve more space for struct bias\_args
[ Upstream commit 7b91f1565fbfbe5a162d91f8a1f6c5580c2fc1d0 ]
On the ASUS laptop UX325JA/UX425JA, most of the media keys are not
working due to the ASUS WMI driver fails to be loaded. The ACPI error
as follows leads to the failure of asus\_wmi\_evaluate\_method.
ACPI BIOS Error (bug): AE\_AML\_BUFFER\_LIMIT, Field [IIA3] at bit offset/length 96/32 exceeds size of target Buffer (96 bits) (20200326/dsopcode-203)
No Local Variables are initialized for Method [WMNB]
ACPI Error: Aborting method \\_SB.ATKD.WMNB due to previous error (AE\_AML\_BUFFER\_LIMIT) (20200326/psparse-531)
The DSDT for the WMNB part shows that 5 DWORD required for local
variables and the 3rd variable IIA3 hit the buffer limit.
Method (WMNB, 3, Serialized)
{ ..
CreateDWordField (Arg2, Zero, IIA0)
CreateDWordField (Arg2, 0x04, IIA1)

Local0 = (Arg1 & 0xFFFFFFFF)

}
The limitation is determined by the input acpi\_buffer size passed
to the wmi\_evaluate\_method. Since the struct bios\_args is the data
structure used as input buffer by default for all ASUS WMI calls,
the size needs to be expanded to fix the problem.

The HP Stream x360 11-p000nd no longer report SW\_TABLET\_MODE state / events
with recent kernels. This model reports a chassis-type of 10 / "Notebook"
which is not on the recently introduced chassis-type whitelist
Commit de9647efeaa9 ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only activate tablet mode
switch on 2-in-1's") added a chassis-type whitelist and only listed 31 /
"Convertible" as being capable of generating valid SW\_TABLET\_MOD events.
Commit 1fac39fd0316 ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Also handle tablet-mode
switch on "Detachable" and "Portable" chassis-types") extended the
whitelist with chassis-types 8 / "Portable" and 32 / "Detachable".
And now we need to exten the whitelist again with 10 / "Notebook"...
The issue original fixed by the whitelist is really a ACPI DSDT bug on
the Dell XPS 9360 where it has a VGBS which reports it is in tablet mode
even though it is not a 2-in-1 at all, but a regular laptop.
So since this is a workaround for a DSDT issue on that specific model,
instead of extending the whitelist over and over again, lets switch to
a blacklist and only blacklist the chassis-type of the model for which
the chassis-type check was added.
Note this also fixes the current version of the code no longer checking
if dmi\_get\_system\_info(DMI\_CHASSIS\_TYPE) returns NULL.

ice: fix potential double free in probe unrolling
[ Upstream commit bc3a024101ca497bea4c69be4054c32a5c349f1d ]
If ice\_init\_interrupt\_scheme fails, ice\_probe will jump to clearing up
the interrupts. This can lead to some static analysis tools such as the
compiler sanitizers complaining about double free problems.
Since ice\_init\_interrupt\_scheme already unrolls internally on failure,
there is no need to call ice\_clear\_interrupt\_scheme when it fails. Add
a new unroll label and use that instead.

mmc: via-sdmmc: Respect the cmd->busy\_timeout from the mmc core
[ Upstream commit 966244ccd2919e28f25555a77f204cd1c109cad8 ]
Using a fixed 1s timeout for all commands (and data transfers) is a bit
problematic.
For some commands it means waiting longer than needed for the timer to
expire, which may not a big issue, but still. For other commands, like for
an erase (CMD38) that uses a R1B response, may require longer timeouts than
1s. In these cases, we may end up treating the command as it failed, while
it just needed some more time to complete successfully.
Fix the problem by respecting the cmd->busy\_timeout, which is provided by
the mmc core.

mmc: mmci: Switch to mmc\_regulator\_set\_vqmmc()
[ Upstream commit 3e09a81e166c0a5544832459be17561a6b231ac7 ]
Instead of reimplementing the logic in mmc\_regulator\_set\_vqmmc(), use the
mmc code function directly.
This also allows us to fix a related issue on STM32MP1, when a voltage
switch of 1.8V is done for the eMMC, but the current level is already set
to 1.8V. More precisely, in this scenario the call to the
->post\_sig\_volt\_switch() hangs, indefinitely waiting for the voltage switch
to complete. Fix this problem by checking if mmc\_regulator\_set\_vqmmc()
returned 1 and then skip invoking the callback.

bcache: fix refcount underflow in bcache\_device\_free()
[ Upstream commit 86da9f736740eba602389908574dfbb0f517baa5 ]
The problematic code piece in bcache\_device\_free() is,
785 static void bcache\_device\_free(struct bcache\_device \*d)
786 {
787 struct gendisk \*disk = d->disk;
[snipped]
799 if (disk) {
800 if (disk->flags & GENHD\_FL\_UP)
801 del\_gendisk(disk);
802
803 if (disk->queue)
804 blk\_cleanup\_queue(disk->queue);
805
806 ida\_simple\_remove(&bcache\_device\_idx,
807 first\_minor\_to\_idx(disk->first\_minor));
808 put\_disk(disk);
809 }
[snipped]
816 }
At line 808, put\_disk(disk) may encounter kobject refcount of 'disk'
being underflow.
Here is how to reproduce the issue,
- Attche the backing device to a cache device and do random write to
make the cache being dirty.
- Stop the bcache device while the cache device has dirty data of the
backing device.
- Only register the backing device back, NOT register cache device.
- The bcache device node /dev/bcache0 won't show up, because backing
device waits for the cache device shows up for the missing dirty
data.
- Now echo 1 into /sys/fs/bcache/pendings\_cleanup, to stop the pending
backing device.
- After the pending backing device stopped, use 'dmesg' to check kernel
message, a use-after-free warning from KASA reported the refcount of
kobject linked to the 'disk' is underflow.
The dropping refcount at line 808 in the above code piece is added by
add\_disk(d->disk) in bch\_cached\_dev\_run(). But in the above condition
the cache device is not registered, bch\_cached\_dev\_run() has no chance
to be called and the refcount is not added. The put\_disk() for a non-
added refcount of gendisk kobject triggers a underflow warning.
This patch checks whether GENHD\_FL\_UP is set in disk->flags, if it is
not set then the bcache device was not added, don't call put\_disk()
and the the underflow issue can be avoided.

nvmet: fix memory leak when removing namespaces and controllers concurrently
[ Upstream commit 64f5e9cdd711b030b05062c17b2ecfbce890cf4c ]
When removing a namespace, we add an NS\_CHANGE async event, however if
the controller admin queue is removed after the event was added but not
yet processed, we won't free the aens, resulting in the below memory
leak [1].
Fix that by moving nvmet\_async\_event\_free to the final controller
release after it is detached from subsys->ctrls ensuring no async
events are added, and modify it to simply remove all pending aens.

ACPI: video: Use native backlight on Acer TravelMate 5735Z
[ Upstream commit c41c36e900a337b4132b12ccabc97f5578248b44 ]
Currently, changing the brightness of the internal display of the Acer
TravelMate 5735Z does not work. Pressing the function keys or changing the
slider, GNOME Shell 3.36.2 displays the OSD (five steps), but the
brightness does not change.
The Acer TravelMate 5735Z shipped with Windows 7 and as such does not
trigger our "win8 ready" heuristic for preferring the native backlight
interface.
Still ACPI backlight control doesn't work on this model, where as the
native (intel\_video) backlight interface does work by adding
`acpi\_backlight=native` or `acpi\_backlight=none` to Linux’ command line.
So, add a quirk to force using native backlight control on this model.

btrfs: qgroup: mark qgroup inconsistent if we're inherting snapshot to a new qgroup
[ Upstream commit cbab8ade585a18c4334b085564d9d046e01a3f70 ]
[BUG]

to snapshot adding to a new qgroup:
# mkfs.btrfs -f $dev
# mount $dev $mnt
# btrfs qgroup en $mnt

0/258 1.02MiB 16.00KiB none none 1/0 ---
1/0 0.00B 0.00B none none --- 0/258
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[CAUSE]
The problem is in btrfs\_qgroup\_inherit(), we don't have good enough
check to determine if the new relation would break the existing
accounting.
Unlike btrfs\_add\_qgroup\_relation(), which has proper check to determine
if we can do quick update without a rescan, in btrfs\_qgroup\_inherit() we
can even assign a snapshot to multiple qgroups.
[FIX]
Fix it by manually marking qgroup inconsistent for snapshot inheritance.
For subvolume creation, since all its extents are exclusively owned, we
don't need to rescan.
In theory, we should call relation check like quick\_update\_accounting()
when doing qgroup inheritance and inform user about qgroup accounting
inconsistency.
But we don't have good mechanism to relay that back to the user in the
snapshot creation context, thus we can only silently mark the qgroup
inconsistent.
Anyway, user shouldn't use qgroup inheritance during snapshot creation,
and should add qgroup relationship after snapshot creation by 'btrfs
qgroup assign', which has a much better UI to inform user about qgroup
inconsistent and kick in rescan automatically.

btrfs: improve global reserve stealing logic
[ Upstream commit 7f9fe614407692f670601a634621138233ac00d7 ]
For unlink transactions and block group removal
btrfs\_start\_transaction\_fallback\_global\_rsv will first try to start an
ordinary transaction and if it fails it will fall back to reserving the
required amount by stealing from the global reserve. This is problematic
because of all the same reasons we had with previous iterations of the
ENOSPC handling, thundering herd. We get a bunch of failures all at
once, everybody tries to allocate from the global reserve, some win and
some lose, we get an ENSOPC.
Fix this behavior by introducing BTRFS\_RESERVE\_FLUSH\_ALL\_STEAL. It's
used to mark unlink reservation. To fix this we need to integrate this
logic into the normal ENOSPC infrastructure. We still go through all of
the normal flushing work, and at the moment we begin to fail all the
tickets we try to satisfy any tickets that are allowed to steal by
stealing from the global reserve. If this works we start the flushing
system over again just like we would with a normal ticket satisfaction.
This serializes our global reserve stealing, so we don't have the
thundering herd problem.

ice: Fix Tx timeout when link is toggled on a VF's interface
[ Upstream commit 4dc926d3a59e73b8c4adf51b261f1a1bbd48a989 ]
Currently if the iavf is loaded and a VF link transitions from up to
down to up again a Tx timeout will be triggered. This happens because
Tx/Rx queue interrupts are only enabled when receiving the
VIRTCHNL\_OP\_CONFIG\_MAP\_IRQ message, which happens on reset or initial
iavf driver load, but not when bringing link up. This is problematic
because they are disabled on the VIRTCHNL\_OP\_DISABLE\_QUEUES message,
which is part of bringing a VF's link down. However, they are not
enabled on the VIRTCHNL\_OP\_ENABLE\_QUEUES message, which is part of
bringing a VF's link up.
Fix this by re-enabling the VF's Rx and Tx queue interrupts when they
were previously configured. This is done by first checking to make
sure the previous value in QINT\_[R|T]QCTL.MSIX\_INDX is not 0, which
is used to represent the OICR in the VF's interrupt space. If the
MSIX\_INDX is non-zero then enable the interrupt by setting the
QINT\_[R|T]CTL.CAUSE\_ENA bit to 1.

drm/amd/powerpay: Disable gfxoff when setting manual mode on picasso and raven
[ Upstream commit cbd2d08c7463e78d625a69e9db27ad3004cbbd99 ]
[Problem description]
1. Boot up picasso platform, launches desktop, Don't do anything (APU enter into "gfxoff" state)
2. Remote login to platform using SSH, then type the command line:
sudo su -c "echo manual > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power\_dpm\_force\_performance\_level"
sudo su -c "echo 2 > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/pp\_dpm\_sclk" (fix SCLK to 1400MHz)
3. Move the mouse around in Window
4. Phenomenon : The screen frozen
Tester will switch sclk level during glmark2 run time.
APU will enter "gfxoff" state intermittently during glmark2 run time.
The system got hanged if fix GFXCLK to 1400MHz when APU is in "gfxoff"
state.
[Debug]
1. Fix SCLK to X MHz
1400: screen frozen, screen black, then OS will reboot.
1300: screen frozen.
1200: screen frozen, screen black.
1100: screen frozen, screen black, then OS will reboot.
1000: screen frozen, screen black.
900: screen frozen, screen black, then OS will reboot.
800: Situation Nomal, issue disappear.
700: Situation Nomal, issue disappear.
2. SBIOS setting: AMD CBS --> SMU Debug Options -->SMU Debug --> "GFX DLDO Psm Margin Control":
50 : Situation Nomal, issue disappear.
45 : Situation Nomal, issue disappear.
40 : Situation Nomal, issue disappear.
35 : Situation Nomal, issue disappear.
30 : screen black.
25 : screen frozen, then blurred screen.
20 : screen frozen.
15 : screen black.
10 : screen frozen.
5 : screen frozen, then blurred screen.
3. Disable GFXOFF feature
Situation Nomal, issue disappear.
[Why]
Through a period of time debugging with Sys Eng team and SMU team, Sys
Eng team said this is voltage/frequency marginal issue not a F/W or H/W
bug. This experiment proves that default targetPsm [for f=1400MHz] is
not sufficient when GFXOFF is enabled on Picasso.
SMU team think it is an odd test conditions to force sclk="1400MHz" when
GPU is in "gfxoff" state，then wake up the GFX. SCLK should be in the
"lowest frequency" when gfxoff.
[How]
Disable gfxoff when setting manual mode.
Enable gfxoff when setting other mode(exiting manual mode) again.
By the way, from the user point of view, now that user switch to manual
mode and force SCLK Frequency, he don't want SCLK be controlled by
workload.It becomes meaningless to "switch to manual mode" if APU enter "gfxoff"
due to lack of workload at this point.
Tips: Same issue observed on Raven.

mips: Add udelay lpj numbers adjustment
[ Upstream commit ed26aacfb5f71eecb20a51c4467da440cb719d66 ]
Loops-per-jiffies is a special number which represents a number of
noop-loop cycles per CPU-scheduler quantum - jiffies. As you
understand aside from CPU-specific implementation it depends on
the CPU frequency. So when a platform has the CPU frequency fixed,
we have no problem and the current udelay interface will work
just fine. But as soon as CPU-freq driver is enabled and the cores
frequency changes, we'll end up with distorted udelay's. In order
to fix this we have to accordinly adjust the per-CPU udelay\_val
(the same as the global loops\_per\_jiffy) number. This can be done
in the CPU-freq transition event handler. We subscribe to that event
in the MIPS arch time-inititalization method.

of physical address value. This shall cover the 64-bits architecture and
systems with XPA enabled, and won't cause any problem for non-XPA 32-bit
systems, since address values exceeding the architecture specific MAAR
mask will be just truncated with setting zeros in the unsupported upper
bits.

xfs: don't fail verifier on empty attr3 leaf block
[ Upstream commit f28cef9e4daca11337cb9f144cdebedaab69d78c ]
The attr fork can transition from shortform to leaf format while
empty if the first xattr doesn't fit in shortform. While this empty
leaf block state is intended to be transient, it is technically not
due to the transactional implementation of the xattr set operation.
We historically have a couple of bandaids to work around this
problem. The first is to hold the buffer after the format conversion
to prevent premature writeback of the empty leaf buffer and the
second is to bypass the xattr count check in the verifier during
recovery. The latter assumes that the xattr set is also in the log
and will be recovered into the buffer soon after the empty leaf
buffer is reconstructed. This is not guaranteed, however.
If the filesystem crashes after the format conversion but before the
xattr set that induced it, only the format conversion may exist in
the log. When recovered, this creates a latent corrupted state on
the inode as any subsequent attempts to read the buffer fail due to
verifier failure. This includes further attempts to set xattrs on
the inode or attempts to destroy the attr fork, which prevents the
inode from ever being removed from the unlinked list.
To avoid this condition, accept that an empty attr leaf block is a
valid state and remove the count check from the verifier. This means
that on rare occasions an attr fork might exist in an unexpected
state, but is otherwise consistent and functional. Note that we
retain the logic to avoid racing with metadata writeback to reduce
the window where this can occur.

x86/boot: Correct relocation destination on old linkers
[ Upstream commit 5214028dd89e49ba27007c3ee475279e584261f0 ]
For the 32-bit kernel, as described in
6d92bc9d483a ("x86/build: Build compressed x86 kernels as PIE"),
pre-2.26 binutils generates R\_386\_32 relocations in PIE mode. Since the
startup code does not perform relocation, any reloc entry with R\_386\_32
will remain as 0 in the executing code.
Commit
974f221c84b0 ("x86/boot: Move compressed kernel to the end of the
decompression buffer")
added a new symbol \_end but did not mark it hidden, which doesn't give
the correct offset on older linkers. This causes the compressed kernel
to be copied beyond the end of the decompression buffer, rather than
flush against it. This region of memory may be reserved or already
allocated for other purposes by the bootloader.
Mark \_end as hidden to fix. This changes the relocation from R\_386\_32 to
R\_386\_RELATIVE even on the pre-2.26 binutils.
For 64-bit, this is not strictly necessary, as the 64-bit kernel is only
built as PIE if the linker supports -z noreloc-overflow, which implies
binutils-2.27+, but for consistency, mark \_end as hidden here too.
The below illustrates the before/after impact of the patch using
binutils-2.25 and gcc-4.6.4 (locally compiled from source) and QEMU.

kgdboc: Use a platform device to handle tty drivers showing up late
[ Upstream commit 68e55f61c13842baf825958129698c5371db432c ]
If you build CONFIG\_KGDB\_SERIAL\_CONSOLE into the kernel then you
should be able to have KGDB init itself at bootup by specifying the
"kgdboc=..." kernel command line parameter. This has worked OK for me
for many years, but on a new device I switched to it stopped working.
The problem is that on this new device the serial driver gets its
probe deferred. Now when kgdb initializes it can't find the tty
driver and when it gives up it never tries again.
We could try to find ways to move up the initialization of the serial
driver and such a thing might be worthwhile, but it's nice to be
robust against serial drivers that load late. We could move kgdb to
init itself later but that penalizes our ability to debug early boot
code on systems where the driver inits early. We could roll our own
system of detecting when new tty drivers get loaded and then use that
to figure out when kgdb can init, but that's ugly.
Instead, let's jump on the -EPROBE\_DEFER bandwagon. We'll create a
singleton instance of a "kgdboc" platform device. If we can't find
our tty device when the singleton "kgdboc" probes we'll return
-EPROBE\_DEFER which means that the system will call us back later to
try again when the tty device might be there.
We won't fully transition all of the kgdboc to a platform device
because early kgdb initialization (via the "ekgdboc" kernel command
line parameter) still runs before the platform device has been
created. The kgdb platform device is merely used as a convenient way
to hook into the system's normal probe deferral mechanisms.
As part of this, we'll ever-so-slightly change how the "kgdboc=..."
kernel command line parameter works. Previously if you booted up and
kgdb couldn't find the tty driver then later reading
'/sys/module/kgdboc/parameters/kgdboc' would return a blank string.
Now kgdb will keep track of the string that came as part of the
command line and give it back to you. It's expected that this should
be an OK change.

This patch drops the use of the static iterator, and instead every time
the function is called iterates to the idx-th position of the
linked-list.
It would be better to convert the code not to use linked list for
associated stations storage (since the chip has a limited number of
associated stations anyway - it could just be an array). Such a change
may be proposed in the future. In the meantime this patch can backported

net: ipa: do not clear interrupt in gsi\_channel\_start()
[ Upstream commit 195ef57f870070cb02f2f3b99a63d69e8e8f798e ]
In gsi\_channel\_start() there is harmless-looking comment "Clear the
channel's event ring interrupt in case it's pending". The intent
was to avoid getting spurious interrupts when first bringing up a
channel.
However we now use channel stop/start to implement suspend and
resume, and an interrupt pending at the time we resume is actually
something we don't want to ignore.
The very first time we bring up the channel we do not expect an
interrupt to be pending, and even if it were, the effect would
simply be to schedule NAPI on that channel, which would find nothing
to do, which is not a problem.
Stop clearing any pending IEOB interrupt in gsi\_channel\_start().
That leaves one caller of the trivial function gsi\_isr\_ieob\_clear().
Get rid of that function and just open-code it in gsi\_isr\_ieob()
instead.
This fixes a problem where suspend/resume IPA v4.2 would get stuck
when resuming after a suspend.

veth: Adjust hard\_start offset on redirect XDP frames

When native XDP redirect into a veth device, the frame arrives in the
xdp\_frame structure. It is then processed in veth\_xdp\_rcv\_one(),
which can run a new XDP bpf\_prog on the packet. Doing so requires
converting xdp\_frame to xdp\_buff, but the tricky part is that
xdp\_frame memory area is located in the top (data\_hard\_start) memory
area that xdp\_buff will point into.
The current code tried to protect the xdp\_frame area, by assigning
xdp\_buff.data\_hard\_start past this memory. This results in 32 bytes
less headroom to expand into via BPF-helper bpf\_xdp\_adjust\_head().
This protect step is actually not needed, because BPF-helper
bpf\_xdp\_adjust\_head() already reserve this area, and don't allow
BPF-prog to expand into it. Thus, it is safe to point data\_hard\_start
directly at xdp\_frame memory area.

[ Upstream commit 81ca627a933063fa63a6d4c66425de822a2ab7f5 ]
When the QoS targets are met and nothing is being throttled, there's
no way to tell how saturated the underlying device is - it could be
almost entirely idle, at the cusp of saturation or anywhere inbetween.
Given that there's no information, it's best to keep vrate as-is in
this state. Before 7cd806a9a953 ("iocost: improve nr\_lagging
handling"), this was the case - if the device isn't missing QoS
targets and nothing is being throttled, busy\_level was reset to zero.
While fixing nr\_lagging handling, 7cd806a9a953 ("iocost: improve
nr\_lagging handling") broke this. Now, while the device is hitting
QoS targets and nothing is being throttled, vrate keeps getting
adjusted according to the existing busy\_level.
This led to vrate keeping climing till it hits max when there's an IO
issuer with limited request concurrency if the vrate started low.
vrate starts getting adjusted upwards until the issuer can issue IOs
w/o being throttled. From then on, QoS targets keeps getting met and
nothing on the system needs throttling and vrate keeps getting
increased due to the existing busy\_level.
This patch makes the following changes to the busy\_level logic.
\* Reset busy\_level if nr\_shortages is zero to avoid the above
scenario.
\* Make non-zero nr\_lagging block lowering nr\_level but still clear
positive busy\_level if there's clear non-saturation signal - QoS
targets are met and nr\_shortages is non-zero. nr\_lagging's role is
preventing adjusting vrate upwards while there are long-running
commands and it shouldn't keep busy\_level positive while there's
clear non-saturation signal.
\* Restructure code for clarity and add comments.

raid5: remove gfp flags from scribble\_alloc()
[ Upstream commit ba54d4d4d2844c234f1b4692bd8c9e0f833c8a54 ]
Using GFP\_NOIO flag to call scribble\_alloc() from resize\_chunk() does
not have the expected behavior. kvmalloc\_array() inside scribble\_alloc()
which receives the GFP\_NOIO flag will eventually call kmalloc\_node() to
allocate physically continuous pages.
Now we have memalloc scope APIs in mddev\_suspend()/mddev\_resume() to
prevent memory reclaim I/Os during raid array suspend context, calling
to kvmalloc\_array() with GFP\_KERNEL flag may avoid deadlock of recursive
I/O as expected.
This patch removes the useless gfp flags from parameters list of
scribble\_alloc(), and call kvmalloc\_array() with GFP\_KERNEL flag. The
incorrect GFP\_NOIO flag does not exist anymore.

md: don't flush workqueue unconditionally in md\_open
[ Upstream commit f6766ff6afff70e2aaf39e1511e16d471de7c3ae ]
We need to check mddev->del\_work before flush workqueu since the purpose
of flush is to ensure the previous md is disappeared. Otherwise the similar
deadlock appeared if LOCKDEP is enabled, it is due to md\_open holds the
bdev->bd\_mutex before flush workqueue.

And md\_alloc also flushed the same workqueue, but the thing is different
here. Because all the paths call md\_alloc don't hold bdev->bd\_mutex, and
the flush is necessary to avoid race condition, so leave it as it is.

net: qed\*: Reduce RX and TX default ring count when running inside kdump kernel
[ Upstream commit 73e030977f7884dbe1be0018bab517e8d02760f8 ]
Normally kdump kernel(s) run under severe memory constraint with the
basic idea being to save the crashdump vmcore reliably when the primary
kernel panics/hangs.
Currently the qed\* ethernet driver ends up consuming a lot of memory in
the kdump kernel, leading to kdump kernel panic when one tries to save
the vmcore via ssh/nfs (thus utilizing the services of the underlying
qed\* network interfaces).
An example OOM message log seen in the kdump kernel can be seen here
[1], with crashkernel size reservation of 512M.
Using tools like memstrack (see [2]), we can track the modules taking up
the bulk of memory in the kdump kernel and organize the memory usage
output as per 'highest allocator first'. An example log for the OOM case
indicates that the qed\* modules end up allocating approximately 216M
memory, which is a large part of the total crashkernel size:

ath10k: Remove msdu from idr when management pkt send fails
[ Upstream commit c730c477176ad4af86d9aae4d360a7ad840b073a ]
Currently when the sending of any management pkt
via wmi command fails, the packet is being unmapped
freed in the error handling. But the idr entry added,
which is used to track these packet is not getting removed.
Hence, during unload, in wmi cleanup, all the entries
in IDR are removed and the corresponding buffer is
attempted to be freed. This can cause a situation where
one packet is attempted to be freed twice.
Fix this error by rmeoving the msdu from the idr
list when the sending of a management packet over
wmi fails.

Since commit 147b27e4bd08 ("nvme-pci: allocate device queues storage

If the write/poll\_queues module parameters are changed at runtime to
values larger than the number of allocated queues in nvme\_probe,
nvme\_alloc\_queue will access unallocated memory.
Add a new nr\_allocated\_queues member to struct nvme\_dev to record how
many queues were alloctated in nvme\_probe to avoid using more than the
allocated queues after a reset following a change to the

platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Also handle tablet-mode switch on "Detachable" and "Portable" chassis-types
[ Upstream commit 1fac39fd0316b19c3e57a182524332332d1643ce ]
Commit de9647efeaa9 ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only activate tablet mode
switch on 2-in-1's") added a DMI chassis-type check to avoid accidentally
reporting SW\_TABLET\_MODE = 1 to userspace on laptops.
Some devices with a detachable keyboard and using the intel-vbnt (INT33D6)
interface to report if they are in tablet mode (keyboard detached) or not,
report 32 / "Detachable" as chassis-type, e.g. the HP Pavilion X2 series.
Other devices with a detachable keyboard and using the intel-vbnt (INT33D6)
interface to report SW\_TABLET\_MODE, report 8 / "Portable" as chassis-type.
The Dell Venue 11 Pro 7130 is an example of this.
Extend the DMI chassis-type check to also accept Portables and Detachables
so that the intel-vbtn driver will report SW\_TABLET\_MODE on these devices.
Note the chassis-type check was originally added to avoid a false-positive
tablet-mode report on the Dell XPS 9360 laptop. To the best of my knowledge
that laptop is using a chassis-type of 9 / "Laptop", so after this commit
we still ignore the tablet-switch for that chassis-type.

platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Do not advertise switches to userspace if they are not there

Commit de9647efeaa9 ("platform/x86: intel-vbtn: Only activate tablet mode

But if we are not getting the initial status of the switch because the
device does not have a tablet mode, then we really should not advertise
the presence of a tablet-mode switch to userspace at all, as userspace may
use the mere presence of this switch for certain heuristics.

xfs: reset buffer write failure state on successful completion
[ Upstream commit b6983e80b03bd4fd42de71993b3ac7403edac758 ]
The buffer write failure flag is intended to control the internal
write retry that XFS has historically implemented to help mitigate
the severity of transient I/O errors. The flag is set when a buffer
is resubmitted from the I/O completion path due to a previous
failure. It is checked on subsequent I/O completions to skip the
internal retry and fall through to the higher level configurable
error handling mechanism. The flag is cleared in the synchronous and
delwri submission paths and also checked in various places to log
write failure messages.
There are a couple minor problems with the current usage of this
flag. One is that we issue an internal retry after every submission
from xfsaild due to how delwri submission clears the flag. This
results in double the expected or configured number of write
attempts when under sustained failures. Another more subtle issue is
that the flag is never cleared on successful I/O completion. This
can cause xfs\_wait\_buftarg() to suggest that dirty buffers are being
thrown away due to the existence of the flag, when the reality is
that the flag might still be set because the write succeeded on the
retry.
Clear the write failure flag on successful I/O completion to address
both of these problems. This means that the internal retry attempt
occurs once since the last time a buffer write failed and that
various other contexts only see the flag set when the immediately
previous write attempt has failed.

kgdb: Fix spurious true from in\_dbg\_master()
[ Upstream commit 3fec4aecb311995189217e64d725cfe84a568de3 ]
Currently there is a small window where a badly timed migration could
cause in\_dbg\_master() to spuriously return true. Specifically if we
migrate to a new core after reading the processor id and the previous
core takes a breakpoint then we will evaluate true if we read
kgdb\_active before we get the IPI to bring us to halt.
Fix this by checking irqs\_disabled() first. Interrupts are always
disabled when we are executing the kgdb trap so this is an acceptable
prerequisite. This also allows us to replace raw\_smp\_processor\_id()
with smp\_processor\_id() since the short circuit logic will prevent
warnings from PREEMPT\_DEBUG.

[ Upstream commit 6b363a286cd01961423f5dcd648b265088ec56d0 ]
This solves the following issues observed during self test when
CONFIG\_CRYPTO\_MANAGER\_EXTRA\_TESTS is enabled.
1. Added fallback for cbc, ctr and rfc3686 if req->nbytes is zero
and for xts added a fallback case if req->nbytes is not multiple of 16.
2. In case of cbc-aes, solved wrong iv update. When
chcr\_cipher\_fallback() is called, used req->info pointer instead of
reqctx->iv.
3. In cbc-aes decryption there was a wrong result. This occurs when
chcr\_cipher\_fallback() is called from chcr\_handle\_cipher\_resp().
In the fallback function iv(req->info) used is wrongly updated.
So use the initial iv for this case.
4)In case of ctr-aes encryption observed wrong result. In adjust\_ctr\_overflow()
there is condition which checks if ((bytes / AES\_BLOCK\_SIZE) > c),
where c is the number of blocks which can be processed without iv overflow,
but for the above bytes (req->nbytes < 32 , not a multiple of 16) this
condition fails and the 2nd block is corrupted as it requires the rollover iv.
So added a '=' condition in this to take care of this.
5)In rfc3686-ctr there was wrong result observed. This occurs when
chcr\_cipher\_fallback() is called from chcr\_handle\_cipher\_resp().
Here also copying initial\_iv in init\_iv pointer for handling the fallback
case correctly.

libertas\_tf: avoid a null dereference in pointer priv
[ Upstream commit 049ceac308b0d57c4f06b9fb957cdf95d315cf0b ]
Currently there is a check if priv is null when calling lbtf\_remove\_card
but not in a previous call to if\_usb\_reset\_dev that can also dereference
priv. Fix this by also only calling lbtf\_remove\_card if priv is null.
It is noteable that there don't seem to be any bugs reported that the
null pointer dereference has ever occurred, so I'm not sure if the null
check is required, but since we're doing a null check anyway it should
be done for both function calls.

The log\_addrs->log\_addr\_type[i] value is a u8 which is controlled by
the user and comes from the ioctl. If it's over 31 then that results in
undefined behavior (shift wrapping) and that leads to a Smatch static
checker warning. We already cap the value later so we can silence the
warning just by re-ordering the existing checks.
I think the UBSan checker will also catch this bug at runtime and
generate a warning. But otherwise the bug is harmless.

sched/core: Fix illegal RCU from offline CPUs
[ Upstream commit bf2c59fce4074e55d622089b34be3a6bc95484fb ]
In the CPU-offline process, it calls mmdrop() after idle entry and the
subsequent call to cpuhp\_report\_idle\_dead(). Once execution passes the
call to rcu\_report\_dead(), RCU is ignoring the CPU, which results in
lockdep complaining when mmdrop() uses RCU from either memcg or
debugobjects below.
Fix it by cleaning up the active\_mm state from BP instead. Every arch
which has CONFIG\_HOTPLUG\_CPU should have already called idle\_task\_exit()
from AP. The only exception is parisc because it switches them to
&init\_mm unconditionally (see smp\_boot\_one\_cpu() and smp\_cpu\_init()),
but the patch will still work there because it calls mmgrab(&init\_mm) in
smp\_cpu\_init() and then should call mmdrop(&init\_mm) in finish\_cpu().

exit: Move preemption fixup up, move blocking operations down

With CONFIG\_DEBUG\_ATOMIC\_SLEEP=y and CONFIG\_CGROUPS=y, kernel oopses in
non-preemptible context look untidy; after the main oops, the kernel prints
a "sleeping function called from invalid context" report because
exit\_signals() -> cgroup\_threadgroup\_change\_begin() -> percpu\_down\_read()
can sleep, and that happens before the preempt\_count\_set(PREEMPT\_ENABLED)
fixup.
It looks like the same thing applies to profile\_task\_exit() and
kcov\_task\_exit().
Fix it by moving the preemption fixup up and the calls to
profile\_task\_exit() and kcov\_task\_exit() down.

This special case for umul\_ppmm for MIPS64r6 was added in
commit bbc25bee37d2b ("lib/mpi: Fix umul\_ppmm() for MIPS64r6"), due to
GCC being inefficient and emitting a \_\_multi3 intrinsic.
There is no such issue with clang; with this patch applied, I can build
this configuration without any problems and there are no link errors
like mentioned in the commit above (which I can still reproduce with
GCC 9.3.0 when that commit is reverted). Only use this definition when
GCC is being used.
This really should have been caught by commit b0c091ae04f67 ("lib/mpi:
Eliminate unused umul\_ppmm definitions for MIPS") when I was messing
around in this area but I was not testing 64-bit MIPS at the time.

net: bcmgenet: Fix WoL with password after deep sleep
[ Upstream commit 6f7689057a0f10a6c967b9f2759d7a3dc948b930 ]
Broadcom STB chips support a deep sleep mode where all register contents
are lost. Because we were stashing the MagicPacket password into some of
these registers a suspend into that deep sleep then a resumption would
not lead to being able to wake-up from MagicPacket with password again.
Fix this by keeping a software copy of the password and program it
during suspend.

net: bcmgenet: set Rx mode before starting netif
[ Upstream commit 72f96347628e73dbb61b307f18dd19293cc6792a ]
This commit explicitly calls the bcmgenet\_set\_rx\_mode() function when
the network interface is started. This function is normally called by
ndo\_set\_rx\_mode when the flags are changed, but apparently not when
the driver is suspended and resumed.
This change ensures that address filtering or promiscuous mode are
properly restored by the driver after the MAC may have been reset.

ARM: 8969/1: decompressor: simplify libfdt builds
[ Upstream commit 7ae4a78daacf240a8247cde73337dc4b26d253da ]
Copying source files during the build time may not end up with
as clean code as expected.
lib/fdt\*.c simply wrap scripts/dtc/libfdt/fdt\*.c, and it works
nicely. Let's follow this approach for the arm decompressor, too.
Add four wrappers, arch/arm/boot/compressed/fdt\*.c and remove
the Makefile messes. Another nice thing is we no longer need to
maintain the own libfdt\_env.h because the decompressor can include
.
There is a subtle problem when generated files are turned into
check-in files.
When you are doing a rebuild of an existing object tree with O=
option, there exists stale "shipped" copies that the old Makefile
implementation created. The build system ends up with compiling the
stale generated files because Make searches for prerequisites in the
current directory, i.e. $(objtree) first, and then the directory
listed in VPATH, i.e. $(srctree).
To mend this issue, I added the following code:
ifdef building\_out\_of\_srctree
$(shell rm -f $(addprefix $(obj)/, fdt\_rw.c fdt\_ro.c fdt\_wip.c fdt.c))
endif
This will need to stay for a while because "git bisect" crossing this
commit, otherwise, would result in a build error.

efi/libstub/random: Align allocate size to EFI\_ALLOC\_ALIGN
[ Upstream commit e1df73e2d18b3b7d66f2ec38d81d9566b3a7fb21 ]
The EFI stub uses a per-architecture #define for the minimum base
and size alignment of page allocations, which is set to 4 KB for
all architecures except arm64, which uses 64 KB, to ensure that
allocations can always be (un)mapped efficiently, regardless of
the page size used by the kernel proper, which could be a kexec'ee
The API wrappers around page based allocations assume that this
alignment is always taken into account, and so efi\_free() will
also round up its size argument to EFI\_ALLOC\_ALIGN.
Currently, efi\_random\_alloc() does not honour this alignment for
the allocated size, and so freeing such an allocation may result
in unrelated memory to be freed, potentially leading to issues
after boot. So let's round up size in efi\_random\_alloc() as well.

Drivers: hv: vmbus: Always handle the VMBus messages on CPU0
[ Upstream commit 8a857c55420f29da4fc131adc22b12d474c48f4c ]
A Linux guest have to pick a "connect CPU" to communicate with the
Hyper-V host. This CPU can not be taken offline because Hyper-V does
not provide a way to change that CPU assignment.
Current code sets the connect CPU to whatever CPU ends up running the
function vmbus\_negotiate\_version(), and this will generate problems if
that CPU is taken offine.
Establish CPU0 as the connect CPU, and add logics to prevents the
connect CPU from being taken offline. We could pick some other CPU,
and we could pick that "other CPU" dynamically if there was a reason to
do so at some point in the future. But for now, #defining the connect
CPU to 0 is the most straightforward and least complex solution.
While on this, add inline comments explaining "why" offer and rescind
messages should not be handled by a same serialized work queue.

Bluetooth: btbcm: Add 2 missing models to subver tables
[ Upstream commit c03ee9af4e07112bd3fc688daca9e654f41eca93 ]
Currently the bcm\_uart\_subver\_ and bcm\_usb\_subver\_table-s lack entries
for the BCM4324B5 and BCM20703A1 chipsets. This makes the code use just
"BCM" as prefix for the filename to pass to request-firmware, making it
harder for users to figure out which firmware they need. This especially
is problematic with the UART attached BCM4324B5 where this leads to the
filename being just "BCM.hcd".
Add the 2 missing devices to subver tables. This has been tested on:
1. A Dell XPS15 9550 where this makes btbcm.c try to load
"BCM20703A1-0a5c-6410.hcd" before it tries to load "BCM-0a5c-6410.hcd".

ath10k: add flush tx packets for SDIO chip
[ Upstream commit dd7fc5545bbafdbd6c1efdc996b61883b285bdc5 ]
When station connected to AP, and run TX traffic such as TCP/UDP, and
system enter suspend state, then mac80211 call ath10k\_flush with set
drop flag, recently it only send wmi peer flush to firmware and
firmware will flush all pending TX packets, for PCIe, firmware will
indicate the TX packets status to ath10k, and then ath10k indicate to
mac80211 TX complete with the status, then all the packets has been
flushed at this moment. For SDIO chip, it is different, its TX
complete indication is disabled by default, and it has a tx queue in
ath10k, and its tx credit control is enabled, total tx credit is 96,
when its credit is not sufficient, then the packets will buffered in
the tx queue of ath10k, max packets is TARGET\_TLV\_NUM\_MSDU\_DESC\_HL
which is 1024, for SDIO, when mac80211 call ath10k\_flush with set drop
flag, maybe it have pending packets in tx queue of ath10k, and if it
does not have sufficient tx credit, the packets will stay in queue
untill tx credit report from firmware, if it is a noisy environment,
tx speed is low and the tx credit report from firmware will delay more
time, then the num\_pending\_tx will remain > 0 untill all packets send
to firmware. After the 1st ath10k\_flush, mac80211 will call the 2nd
ath10k\_flush without set drop flag immediately, then it will call to
ath10k\_mac\_wait\_tx\_complete, and it wait untill num\_pending\_tx become
to 0, in noisy environment, it is esay to wait about near 5 seconds,
then it cause the suspend take long time.

Flush all pending TX packets for the 1st ath10k\_flush reduced the wait
time of the 2nd ath10k\_flush and then suspend take short time.
This Patch only effect SDIO chips.
Tested with QCA6174 SDIO with firmware WLAN.RMH.4.4.1-00042.

void \_\_init plat\_swiotlb\_setup(void)

if (!octeon\_swiotlb)
panic("%s: Failed to allocate %zu bytes align=%lx\n",
\_\_func\_\_, swiotlbsize, PAGE\_SIZE);
...
}
Because IO\_TLB\_DEFAULT\_SIZE is 64M, if the rest size of low memory is less
than 64M when call plat\_swiotlb\_setup(), we can easily reproduce the panic
case.
In order to reduce the possibility of kernel panic when failed to get IO
TLB memory under CONFIG\_SWIOTLB, it is better to allocate low memory as
small as possible before plat\_swiotlb\_setup(), so make sparse\_init() using
top-down allocation.

media: platform: fcp: Set appropriate DMA parameters
[ Upstream commit dd844fb8e50b12e65bbdc5746c9876c6735500df ]
Enabling CONFIG\_DMA\_API\_DEBUG=y and CONFIG\_DMA\_API\_DEBUG\_SG=y will
enable extra validation on DMA operations ensuring that the size
restraints are met.
When using the FCP in conjunction with the VSP1/DU, and display frames,
the size of the DMA operations is larger than the default maximum
segment size reported by the DMA core (64K). With the DMA debug enabled,
this produces a warning such as the following:
"DMA-API: rcar-fcp fea27000.fcp: mapping sg segment longer than device
claims to support [len=3145728] [max=65536]"
We have no specific limitation on the segment size which isn't already
handled by the VSP1/DU which actually handles the DMA allcoations and
buffer management, so define a maximum segment size of up to 4GB (a 32
bit mask).

drm/ast: Allocate initial CRTC state of the correct size
[ Upstream commit f0adbc382b8bb46a2467c4e5e1027763a197c8e1 ]
The ast driver inherits from DRM's CRTC state, but still uses the atomic
helper for struct drm\_crtc\_funcs.reset, drm\_atomic\_helper\_crtc\_reset().
The helper only allocates enough memory for the core CRTC state. That
results in an out-ouf-bounds access when duplicating the initial CRTC
state. Simplified backtrace shown below:

net: mscc: ocelot: deal with problematic MAC\_ETYPE VCAP IS2 rules
[ Upstream commit 89f9ffd3eb670bad1260bc579f5e13b8f2d5b3e0 ]
By default, the VCAP IS2 will produce a single match for each frame, on
the most specific classification.
Example: a ping packet (ICMP over IPv4 over Ethernet) sent from an IP
address of 10.0.0.1 and a MAC address of 96:18:82:00:04:01 will match
this rule:
tc filter add dev swp0 ingress protocol ipv4 \
flower skip\_sw src\_ip 10.0.0.1 action drop
but not this one:
tc filter add dev swp0 ingress \
flower skip\_sw src\_mac 96:18:82:00:04:01 action drop
Currently the driver does not really warn the user in any way about
this, and the behavior is rather strange anyway.
The current patch is a workaround to force matches on MAC\_ETYPE keys
(DMAC and SMAC) for all packets irrespective of higher layer protocol.
The setting is made at the port level.
Of course this breaks all other non-src\_mac and non-dst\_mac matches, so
rule exclusivity checks have been added to the driver, in order to never
have rules of both types on any ingress port.
The bits that discard higher-level protocol information are set only
once a MAC\_ETYPE rule is added to a filter block, and only for the ports
that are bound to that filter block. Then all further non-MAC\_ETYPE
rules added to that filter block should be denied by the ports bound to
it.

e1000: Distribute switch variables for initialization
[ Upstream commit a34c7f5156654ebaf7eaace102938be7ff7036cb ]
Variables declared in a switch statement before any case statements
cannot be automatically initialized with compiler instrumentation (as
they are not part of any execution flow). With GCC's proposed automatic
stack variable initialization feature, this triggers a warning (and they
don't get initialized). Clang's automatic stack variable initialization
(via CONFIG\_INIT\_STACK\_ALL=y) doesn't throw a warning, but it also
doesn't initialize such variables[1]. Note that these warnings (or silent
skipping) happen before the dead-store elimination optimization phase,
so even when the automatic initializations are later elided in favor of
direct initializations, the warnings remain.
To avoid these problems, move such variables into the "case" where
they're used or lift them up into the main function body.

tools api fs: Make xxx\_\_mountpoint() more scalable
[ Upstream commit c6fddb28bad26e5472cb7acf7b04cd5126f1a4ab ]
The xxx\_mountpoint() interface provided by fs.c finds mount points for
common pseudo filesystems. The first time xxx\_mountpoint() is invoked,
it scans the mount table (/proc/mounts) looking for a match. If found,
it is cached. The price to scan /proc/mounts is paid once if the mount
is found.
When the mount point is not found, subsequent calls to xxx\_mountpoint()
scan /proc/mounts over and over again. There is no caching.
This causes a scaling issue in perf record with hugeltbfs\_\_mountpoint().
The function is called for each process found in
synthesize\_\_mmap\_events(). If the machine has thousands of processes
and if the /proc/mounts has many entries this could cause major overhead
in perf record. We have observed multi-second slowdowns on some
configurations.
As an example on a laptop:
Before:
$ sudo umount /dev/hugepages
$ strace -e trace=openat -o /tmp/tt perf record -a ls
$ fgrep mounts /tmp/tt
285
After:
$ sudo umount /dev/hugepages
$ strace -e trace=openat -o /tmp/tt perf record -a ls
$ fgrep mounts /tmp/tt
1
One could argue that the non-caching in case the moint point is not
found is intentional. That way subsequent calls may discover a moint
point if the sysadmin mounts the filesystem. But the same argument could
be made against caching the mount point. It could be unmounted causing
errors. It all depends on the intent of the interface. This patch
assumes it is expected to scan /proc/mounts once. The patch documents
the caching behavior in the fs.h header file.
An alternative would be to just fix perf record. But it would solve the
problem with hugetlbs\_\_mountpoint() but there could be similar issues
(possibly down the line) with other xxx\_mountpoint() calls in perf or
other tools.

x86/kvm/hyper-v: Explicitly align hcall param for kvm\_hyperv\_exit
[ Upstream commit f7d31e65368aeef973fab788aa22c4f1d5a6af66 ]
The problem the patch is trying to address is the fact that 'struct
kvm\_hyperv\_exit' has different layout on when compiling in 32 and 64 bit
modes.
In 64-bit mode the default alignment boundary is 64 bits thus
forcing extra gaps after 'type' and 'msr' but in 32-bit mode the
boundary is at 32 bits thus no extra gaps.
This is an issue as even when the kernel is 64 bit, the userspace using
the interface can be both 32 and 64 bit but the same 32 bit userspace has
to work with 32 bit kernel.
The issue is fixed by forcing the 64 bit layout, this leads to ABI
change for 32 bit builds and while we are obviously breaking '32 bit
userspace with 32 bit kernel' case, we're fixing the '32 bit userspace
with 64 bit kernel' one.
As the interface has no (known) users and 32 bit KVM is rather baroque
nowadays, this seems like a reasonable decision.

spi: dw: Fix Rx-only DMA transfers
[ Upstream commit 46164fde6b7890e7a3982d54549947c8394c0192 ]
Tx-only DMA transfers are working perfectly fine since in this case
the code just ignores the Rx FIFO overflow interrupts. But it turns
out the SPI Rx-only transfers are broken since nothing pushing any
data to the shift registers, so the Rx FIFO is left empty and the
SPI core subsystems just returns a timeout error. Since DW DMAC
driver doesn't support something like cyclic write operations of
a single byte to a device register, the only way to support the
Rx-only SPI transfers is to fake it by using a dummy Tx-buffer.
This is what we intend to fix in this commit by setting the
SPI\_CONTROLLER\_MUST\_TX flag for DMA-capable platform.

mmc: meson-mx-sdio: trigger a soft reset after a timeout or CRC error
[ Upstream commit 91995b904ec2e44b5c159ac6a5d3f154345a4de7 ]
The vendor driver (from the 3.10 kernel) triggers a soft reset every
time before starting a new command. While this fixes a problem where
SDIO cards are not detected at all (because all commands simply
timed out) this hurts SD card read performance a bit (in my tests
between 10% to 20%).
Trigger a soft reset after we got a CRC error or if the previous command
timed out (just like the vendor driver from the same 3.10 kernel for the
newer SDHC controller IP does). This fixes detection of SDIO cards and
doesn't hurt SD card read performance at the same time.
With this patch the initialization of an RTL8723BS SDIO card looks like
this:
req done (CMD52): -110: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000

mmc: mmci\_sdmmc: fix power on issue due to pwr\_reg initialization
[ Upstream commit 33ba6fec0012e47f4e72bfab922b99327373f210 ]
This patch fix a power-on issue, and avoid to retry the power sequence.
In power off sequence: sdmmc must set pwr\_reg in "power-cycle" state
(value 0x2), to prevent the card from being supplied through the signal
lines (all the lines are driven low).
In power on sequence: when the power is stable, sdmmc must set pwr\_reg
in "power-off" state (value 0x0) to drive all signal to high before to
set "power-on".
To avoid writing the same value to the power register several times, this
register is cached by the pwr\_reg variable. At probe pwr\_reg is initialized
to 0 by kzalloc of mmc\_alloc\_host.
Like pwr\_reg value is 0 at probing, the power on sequence fail because
the "power-off" state is not writes (value 0x0) and the lines
remain drive to low.
This patch initializes "pwr\_reg" variable with power register value.
This it done in sdmmc variant init to not disturb default mmci behavior.

This is a known false positive because inodes cannot simultaneously be
getting reclaimed and the target of a getxattr operation, but lockdep
doesn't know that. We can (selectively) shut up lockdep until either
it gets smarter or we change inode reclaim not to require the ILOCK by
applying a stupid GFP\_NOLOCKDEP bandaid.

batman-adv: Revert "disable ethtool link speed detection when auto negotiation off"
[ Upstream commit 9ad346c90509ebd983f60da7d082f261ad329507 ]
The commit 8c46fcd78308 ("batman-adv: disable ethtool link speed detection
when auto negotiation off") disabled the usage of ethtool's link\_ksetting
when auto negotation was enabled due to invalid values when used with
tun/tap virtual net\_devices. According to the patch, automatic measurements
should be used for these kind of interfaces.
But there are major flaws with this argumentation:
\* automatic measurements are not implemented
\* auto negotiation has nothing to do with the validity of the retrieved
values
The first point has to be fixed by a longer patch series. The "validity"
part of the second point must be addressed in the same patch series by
dropping the usage of ethtool's link\_ksetting (thus always doing automatic
measurements over ethernet).
Drop the patch again to have more default values for various net\_device
types/configurations. The user can still overwrite them using the
batadv\_hardif's BATADV\_ATTR\_THROUGHPUT\_OVERRIDE.

ARM: 8978/1: mm: make act\_mm() respect THREAD\_SIZE

Recent work with KASan exposed the folling hard-coded bitmask
in arch/arm/mm/proc-macros.S:
bic rd, sp, #8128
bic rd, rd, #63
This forms the bitmask 0x1FFF that is coinciding with
(PAGE\_SIZE << THREAD\_SIZE\_ORDER) - 1, this code was assuming
that THREAD\_SIZE is always 8K (8192).
As KASan was increasing THREAD\_SIZE\_ORDER to 2, I ran into
this bug.
Fix it by this little oneline suggested by Ard:
bic rd, sp, #(THREAD\_SIZE - 1) & ~63
Where THREAD\_SIZE is defined using THREAD\_SIZE\_ORDER.
We have to also include  since the THREAD\_SIZE
expands to use the \_AC() macro.

spi: mux: repair mux usage
[ Upstream commit a2b02e4623fb127fa65a13e4ac5aa56e4ae16291 ]
It is not valid to cache/short out selection of the mux.
mux\_control\_select() only locks the mux until mux\_control\_deselect()
is called. mux\_control\_deselect() may put the mux in some low power
state or some other user of the mux might select it for other purposes.
These things are probably not happening in the original setting where
this driver was developed, but it is said to be a generic SPI mux.
Also, the mux framework will short out the actual low level muxing
operation when/if that is possible.

btrfs: do not ignore error from btrfs\_next\_leaf() when inserting checksums
[ Upstream commit 7e4a3f7ed5d54926ec671bbb13e171cfe179cc50 ]
We are currently treating any non-zero return value from btrfs\_next\_leaf()
the same way, by going to the code that inserts a new checksum item in the
tree. However if btrfs\_next\_leaf() returns an error (a value < 0), we
should just stop and return the error, and not behave as if nothing has
happened, since in that case we do not have a way to know if there is a
next leaf or we are currently at the last leaf already.
So fix that by returning the error from btrfs\_next\_leaf().

This meant there were still open transaction handles holding space, yet
the flusher didn't commit the transaction because it deemed the freed

by accounting for space in trans\_block\_rsv when deciding whether the

clocksource: dw\_apb\_timer\_of: Fix missing clockevent timers
[ Upstream commit 6d2e16a3181bafb77b535095c39ad1c8b9558c8c ]
Commit 100214889973 ("clocksource: dw\_apb\_timer\_of: use
clocksource\_of\_init") replaced a publicly available driver
initialization method with one called by the timer\_probe() method
available after CLKSRC\_OF. In current implementation it traverses
all the timers available in the system and calls their initialization
methods if corresponding devices were either in dtb or in acpi. But
if before the commit any number of available timers would be installed
as clockevent and clocksource devices, after that there would be at most
two. The rest are just ignored since default case branch doesn't do
anything. I don't see a reason of such behaviour, neither the commit
message explains it. Moreover this might be wrong if on some platforms
these timers might be used for different purpose, as virtually CPU-local
clockevent timers and as an independent broadcast timer. So in order
to keep the compatibility with the platforms where the order of the
timers detection has some meaning, lets add the secondly discovered
timer to be of clocksource/sched\_clock type, while the very first and
the others would provide the clockevents service.

clocksource: dw\_apb\_timer: Make CPU-affiliation being optional
[ Upstream commit cee43dbf2ee3f430434e2b66994eff8a1aeda889 ]
Currently the DW APB Timer driver binds each clockevent timers to a
particular CPU. This isn't good for multiple reasons. First of all seeing
the device is placed on APB bus (which makes it accessible from any CPU
core), accessible over MMIO and having the DYNIRQ flag set we can be sure
that manually binding the timer to any CPU just isn't correct. By doing
so we just set an extra limitation on device usage. This also doesn't
reflect the device actual capability, since by setting the IRQ affinity
we can make it virtually local to any CPU. Secondly imagine if you had a
real CPU-local timer with the same rating and the same CPU-affinity.
In this case if DW APB timer was registered first, then due to the
clockevent framework tick-timer selection procedure we'll end up with the
real CPU-local timer being left unselected for clock-events tracking. But
on most of the platforms (MIPS/ARM/etc) such timers are normally embedded
into the CPU core and are accessible with much better performance then
devices placed on APB. For instance in MIPS architectures there is
r4k-timer, which is CPU-local, assigned with the same rating, and normally
its clockevent device is registered after the platform-specific one.
So in order to fix all of these issues let's make the DW APB Timer CPU
affinity being optional and deactivated by passing a negative CPU id,
which will effectively set the DW APB clockevent timer cpumask to
'cpu\_possible\_mask'.

So, this patch clears the OF\_POPULATED flag to continue creating the

It's pointless to track the Tx overrun interrupts if Rx-only SPI

overrun/underrun interrupts if Tx-only SPI transfer is executed.
So lets unmask the interrupts only if corresponding SPI

mips: Fix cpu\_has\_mips64r1/2 activation for MIPS32 CPUs
[ Upstream commit a2ac81c6ef4018ea49c034ce165bb9ea1cf99f3e ]
Commit 1aeba347b3a9 ("MIPS: Hardcode cpu\_has\_mips\* where target ISA
allows") updated the cpu\_has\_mips\* macro to be replaced with a constant
expression where it's possible. By mistake it wasn't done correctly
for cpu\_has\_mips64r1/cpu\_has\_mips64r2 macro. They are defined to
be replaced with conditional expression \_\_isa\_range\_or\_flag(), which
means either ISA revision being within the range or the corresponding
CPU options flag was set at the probe stage or both being true at the
same time. But the ISA level value doesn't indicate whether the ISA is
MIPS32 or MIPS64. Due to this if we select MIPS32r1 - MIPS32r5
architectures the \_\_isa\_range() macro will activate the
cpu\_has\_mips64rX flags, which is incorrect. In order to fix the
problem we make sure the 64bits CPU support is enabled by means of
checking the flag cpu\_has\_64bits aside with proper ISA range and specific
Revision flag being set.

ACPI/IORT: Fix PMCG node single ID mapping handling
[ Upstream commit 50c8ab8d9fbf5b18d5162a797ca26568afc0af1a ]
An IORT PMCG node can have no ID mapping if its overflow interrupt is
wire based therefore the code that parses the PMCG node can not assume
the node will always have a single mapping present at index 0.
Fix iort\_get\_id\_mapping\_index() by checking for an overflow interrupt
and mapping count.

ath11k: Fix some resource leaks in error path in 'ath11k\_thermal\_register()'

If 'thermal\_cooling\_device\_register()' fails, we must undo what has been

returning directly
In case of error in 'ath11k\_thermal\_register()', the previous

kgdb: Disable WARN\_CONSOLE\_UNLOCKED for all kgdb
[ Upstream commit 202164fbfa2b2ffa3e66b504e0f126ba9a745006 ]
In commit 81eaadcae81b ("kgdboc: disable the console lock when in
kgdb") we avoided the WARN\_CONSOLE\_UNLOCKED() yell when we were in
kgdboc. That still works fine, but it turns out that we get a similar
yell when using other I/O drivers. One example is the "I/O driver"
for the kgdb test suite (kgdbts). When I enabled that I again got the
same yells.
Even though "kgdbts" doesn't actually interact with the user over the
console, using it still causes kgdb to print to the consoles. That
trips the same warning:

Let's increment/decrement the "ignore\_console\_lock\_warning" variable

This will allow us to later revert commit 81eaadcae81b ("kgdboc:

Bluetooth PTS test case HFP/AG/ACC/BI-12-I accepts SCO connection
with invalid parameter at the first SCO request expecting AG to
attempt another SCO request with the use of "safe settings" for

cpuidle: psci: Fixup execution order when entering a domain idle state
[ Upstream commit 8b7ce5e49049ca78c238f03d70569a73da049f32 ]
Moving forward, platforms are going to need to execute specific "last-man"
operations before a domain idle state can be entered. In one way or the
other, these operations needs to be triggered while walking the
hierarchical topology via runtime PM and genpd, as it's at that point the
last-man becomes known.
Moreover, executing last-man operations needs to be done after the CPU PM
notifications are sent through cpu\_pm\_enter(), as otherwise it's likely
that some notifications would fail. Therefore, let's re-order the sequence
in psci\_enter\_domain\_idle\_state(), so cpu\_pm\_enter() gets called prior
pm\_runtime\_put\_sync().

ixgbe: Fix XDP redirect on archs with PAGE\_SIZE above 4K
[ Upstream commit 88eb0ee17b2ece64fcf6689a4557a5c2e7a89c4b ]
The ixgbe driver have another memory model when compiled on archs with
PAGE\_SIZE above 4096 bytes. In this mode it doesn't split the page in
two halves, but instead increment rx\_buffer->page\_offset by truesize of
packet (which include headroom and tailroom for skb\_shared\_info).
This is done correctly in ixgbe\_build\_skb(), but in ixgbe\_rx\_buffer\_flip
which is currently only called on XDP\_TX and XDP\_REDIRECT, it forgets
to add the tailroom for skb\_shared\_info. This breaks XDP\_REDIRECT, for
veth and cpumap. Fix by adding size of skb\_shared\_info tailroom.

arm64: insn: Fix two bugs in encoding 32-bit logical immediates
[ Upstream commit 579d1b3faa3735e781ff74aac0afd598515dbc63 ]
This patch fixes two issues present in the current function for encoding
arm64 logical immediates when using the 32-bit variants of instructions.
First, the code does not correctly reject an all-ones 32-bit immediate,
and returns an undefined instruction encoding.
Second, the code incorrectly rejects some 32-bit immediates that are
actually encodable as logical immediates. The root cause is that the code
uses a default mask of 64-bit all-ones, even for 32-bit immediates.
This causes an issue later on when the default mask is used to fill the
top bits of the immediate with ones, shown here:
/\*
\* Pattern: 0..01..10..01..1
\*
\* Fill the unused top bits with ones, and check if
\* the result is a valid immediate (all ones with a
\* contiguous ranges of zeroes).
\*/
imm |= ~mask;
if (!range\_of\_ones(~imm))
return AARCH64\_BREAK\_FAULT;
To see the problem, consider an immediate of the form 0..01..10..01..1,
where the upper 32 bits are zero, such as 0x80000001. The code checks
if ~(imm | ~mask) contains a range of ones: the incorrect mask yields
1..10..01..10..0, which fails the check; the correct mask yields
0..01..10..0, which succeeds.
The fix for both issues is to generate a correct mask based on the
instruction immediate size, and use the mask to check for all-ones,
all-zeroes, and values wider than the mask.
Currently, arch/arm64/kvm/va\_layout.c is the only user of this function,
which uses 64-bit immediates and therefore won't trigger these bugs.
We tested the new code against llvm-mc with all 1,302 encodable 32-bit
logical immediates and all 5,334 encodable 64-bit logical immediates.

block: alloc map and request for new hardware queue
[ Upstream commit fd689871bbfbb41cd77379d3e9e5f4def0f7d6c6 ]
Alloc new map and request for new hardware queue when increse
hardware queue count. Before this patch, it will show a
warning for each new hardware queue, but it's not enough, these
hctx have no maps and reqeust, when a bio was mapped to these
hardware queue, it will trigger kernel panic when get request
from these hctx.
Test environment:
\* A NVMe disk supports 128 io queues
\* 96 cpus in system
A corner case can always trigger this panic, there are 96
io queues allocated for HCTX\_TYPE\_DEFAULT type, the corresponding kernel
log: nvme nvme0: 96/0/0 default/read/poll queues. Now we set nvme write
queues to 96, then nvme will alloc others(32) queues for read, but
blk\_mq\_update\_nr\_hw\_queues does not alloc map and request for these new
added io queues. So when process read nvme disk, it will trigger kernel
panic when get request from these hardware context.
Reproduce script:
nr=$(expr `cat /sys/block/nvme0n1/device/queue\_count` - 1)
echo $nr > /sys/module/nvme/parameters/write\_queues
echo 1 > /sys/block/nvme0n1/device/reset\_controller
dd if=/dev/nvme0n1 of=/dev/null bs=4K count=1

arm64: cacheflush: Fix KGDB trap detection
[ Upstream commit ab8ad279ceac4fc78ae4dcf1a26326e05695e537 ]
flush\_icache\_range() contains a bodge to avoid issuing IPIs when the kgdb
trap handler is running because issuing IPIs is unsafe (and not needed)
in this execution context. However the current test, based on
kgdb\_connected is flawed: it both over-matches and under-matches.
The over match occurs because kgdb\_connected is set when gdb attaches
to the stub and remains set during normal running. This is relatively
harmelss because in almost all cases irq\_disabled() will be false.
The under match is more serious. When kdb is used instead of kgdb to access
the debugger then kgdb\_connected is not set in all the places that the
debug core updates sw breakpoints (and hence flushes the icache). This
can lead to deadlock.
Fix by replacing the ad-hoc check with the proper kgdb macro. This also
allows us to drop the #ifdef wrapper.

ath10k: remove the max\_sched\_scan\_reqs value

The struct cfg80211\_wowlan of NET\_DETECT WoWLAN feature share the same
struct cfg80211\_sched\_scan\_request together with scheduled scan request
feature, and max\_sched\_scan\_reqs of wiphy is only used for sched scan,
and ath10k does not support scheduled scan request feature, so ath10k
does not set flag NL80211\_FEATURE\_SCHED\_SCAN\_RANDOM\_MAC\_ADDR, but ath10k
set max\_sched\_scan\_reqs of wiphy to a non zero value 1, then function
nl80211\_add\_commands\_unsplit of cfg80211 will set it support command
NL80211\_CMD\_START\_SCHED\_SCAN because max\_sched\_scan\_reqs is a non zero
value, but actually ath10k not support it, then it leads a mismatch result
for sched scan of cfg80211, then application shill found the mismatch and
stop running case of MAC random address scan and then the case fail.
After remove max\_sched\_scan\_reqs value, it keeps match for sched scan and
case of MAC random address scan pass.

efi/libstub/x86: Work around LLVM ELF quirk build regression
[ Upstream commit f77767ed5f4d398b29119563155e4ece2dfeee13 ]
When building the x86 EFI stub with Clang, the libstub Makefile rules
that manipulate the ELF object files may throw an error like:
STUBCPY drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/efi-stub-helper.stub.o
strip: drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/efi-stub-helper.stub.o: Failed to find link section for section 10
objcopy: drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/efi-stub-helper.stub.o: Failed to find link section for section 10
This is the result of a LLVM feature [0] where symbol references are
stored in a LLVM specific .llvm\_addrsig section in a non-transparent way,
causing generic ELF tools such as strip or objcopy to choke on them.
So force the compiler not to emit these sections, by passing the
appropriate command line option.

In order to prevent possible hardlockup of sched\_cfs\_period\_timer()
loop, loop count is introduced to denote whether to scale quota and
period or not. However, scale is done between forwarding period timer
and refilling cfs bandwidth runtime, which means that period timer is
forwarded with old "period" while runtime is refilled with scaled
"quota".
Move do\_sched\_cfs\_period\_timer() before scaling to solve this.

x86,smap: Fix smap\_{save,restore}() alternatives

the smap\_{save,restore}() alternatives violate (the newly enforced)

violate this with the direct result that unwinds will not be correct

spi: pxa2xx: Apply CS clk quirk to BXT

With a couple allies at Intel, and much badgering, I got confirmation
from Intel that at least BXT suffers from the same SPI chip-select
issue as Cannonlake (and beyond). The issue being that after going
through runtime suspend/resume, toggling the chip-select line without
also sending data does nothing.
Add the quirk to BXT to briefly toggle dynamic clock gating off and
on, forcing the fabric to wake up enough to notice the CS register
change.

arm64/kernel: Fix range on invalidating dcache for boot page tables
[ Upstream commit 9d2d75ede59bc1edd8561f2ee9d4702a5ea0ae30 ]
Prior to commit 8eb7e28d4c642c31 ("arm64/mm: move runtime pgds to
rodata"), idmap\_pgd\_dir, tramp\_pg\_dir, reserved\_ttbr0, swapper\_pg\_dir,
and init\_pg\_dir were contiguous at the end of the kernel image. The
maintenance at the end of \_\_create\_page\_tables assumed these were
contiguous, and affected everything from the start of idmap\_pg\_dir
to the end of init\_pg\_dir.
That commit moved all but init\_pg\_dir into the .rodata section, with
other data placed between idmap\_pg\_dir and init\_pg\_dir, but did not
update the maintenance. Hence the maintenance is performed on much
more data than necessary (but as the bootloader previously made this
clean to the PoC there is no functional problem).
As we only alter idmap\_pg\_dir, and init\_pg\_dir, we only need to perform
maintenance for these. As the other dirs are in .rodata, the bootloader
will have initialised them as expected and cleaned them to the PoC. The
kernel will initialize them as necessary after enabling the MMU.
This patch reworks the maintenance to only cover the idmap\_pg\_dir and
init\_pg\_dir to avoid this unnecessary work.

drm/bridge: panel: Return always an error pointer in drm\_panel\_bridge\_add()
[ Upstream commit 30be3031087139061de4421bf52015931eaab569 ]
Since commit 89958b7cd955 ("drm/bridge: panel: Infer connector type from
panel by default"), drm\_panel\_bridge\_add() and their variants can return
NULL and an error pointer. This is fine but none of the actual users of
the API are checking for the NULL value. Instead of change all the
users, seems reasonable to return an error pointer instead. So change
the returned value for those functions when the connector type is unknown.

drm/amdgpu: Init data to avoid oops while reading pp\_num\_states.
[ Upstream commit 6f81b2d047c59eb77cd04795a44245d6a52cdaec ]
For chip like CHIP\_OLAND with si enabled(amdgpu.si\_support=1),
the amdgpu will expose pp\_num\_states to the /sys directory.
In this moment, read the pp\_num\_states file will excute the
amdgpu\_get\_pp\_num\_states func. In our case, the data hasn't
been initialized, so the kernel will access some ilegal
address, trigger the segmentfault and system will reboot soon:

drm/amd/display: Force watermark value propagation
[ Upstream commit 868149c9a072cbdc22a73ce25a487f9fbfa171ef ]
[Why]
The HUBBUB watermark registers are in an area that cannot be power
gated, but the HUBP copies of the watermark values are in areas that can
be power gated. When we power on a pipe, it will not automatically take
the HUBBUB values, we need to force propagation by writing to a
watermark register.
[How]
- new HUBBUB function to re-write current value in a WM register
- touch WM register after enabling the plane in program\_pipe

igc: Fix default MAC address filter override
[ Upstream commit ac9156b27564a089ec52f526bfcb59f61c34e7c6 ]
This patch fixes a bug when the user adds the first MAC address filter
via ethtool NFC mechanism.
When the first MAC address filter is added, it overwrites the default
MAC address filter configured at RAL[0] and RAH[0]. As consequence,
frames addressed to the interface MAC address are not sent to host
anymore.
This patch fixes the bug by calling igc\_set\_default\_mac\_filter() during
adapter init so the position 0 of adapter->mac\_table[] is assigned to
the default MAC address.

crypto: ccp -- don't "select" CONFIG\_DMADEVICES

DMADEVICES is the top-level option for the slave DMA
subsystem, and should not be selected by device drivers,
as this can cause circular dependencies such as:
drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/Kconfig:6:error: recursive dependency detected!
drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/Kconfig:6: symbol NET\_VENDOR\_FREESCALE depends on PPC\_BESTCOMM
drivers/dma/bestcomm/Kconfig:6: symbol PPC\_BESTCOMM depends on DMADEVICES
drivers/dma/Kconfig:6: symbol DMADEVICES is selected by CRYPTO\_DEV\_SP\_CCP
drivers/crypto/ccp/Kconfig:10: symbol CRYPTO\_DEV\_SP\_CCP depends on CRYPTO
crypto/Kconfig:16: symbol CRYPTO is selected by LIBCRC32C
lib/Kconfig:222: symbol LIBCRC32C is selected by LIQUIDIO
drivers/net/ethernet/cavium/Kconfig:65: symbol LIQUIDIO depends on PTP\_1588\_CLOCK
drivers/ptp/Kconfig:8: symbol PTP\_1588\_CLOCK is implied by FEC
drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/Kconfig:23: symbol FEC depends on NET\_VENDOR\_FREESCALE
The LIQUIDIO driver causing this problem is addressed in a
separate patch, but this change is needed to prevent it from
happening again.
Using "depends on DMADEVICES" is what we do for all other
implementations of slave DMA controllers as well.

media: imx: imx7-mipi-csis: Cleanup and fix subdev pad format handling
[ Upstream commit d321dd233b9f2bb407b8e6b4759408f09ec207c3 ]
The subdev set pad format operation currently misbehaves in multiple ways:
- mipi\_csis\_try\_format() unconditionally stores the format in the device
state, even for V4L2\_SUBDEV\_FORMAT\_TRY.
- The format is never stored in the pad cfg, but the pad cfg format
always overwrites the format requested by the user.
- The sink format is not propagated to the source.
Fix all this by reworking the set format operation as follows:
1. For the source pad, turn set() into get() as the source format is not
modifiable.
2. Validate the requested format and updated the stored format
accordingly.
3. Return the format actually set.
4. Propagate the format from sink to source.

Commit ea6f3af4c5e63f69 ("ACPI: GED: add support for \_Exx / \_Lxx handler

normal or the extended ACPI IRQ resource struct, but inadvertently used
the wrong pointer in the latter case. Note that both pointers refer to the
same union, and the 'triggering' field appears at the same offset in both
struct types, so it currently happens to work by accident. But let's fix
it nonetheless
