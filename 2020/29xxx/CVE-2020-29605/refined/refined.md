Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-29605:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access level checks in `bug_actiongroup_page.php`. Specifically, when a user attempts to perform group actions on issues, the application does not properly verify if the user has the required permission to access the summary of private issues included in the action.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper access control when processing issue IDs in `bug_actiongroup_page.php`. It allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and view summaries of private issues.
- **Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability is also exploitable due to the application using direct references to issue IDs (`bug_arr[]`) in the URL, allowing an attacker to manipulate these IDs to access private issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An unprivileged user can gain unauthorized access to the summaries of private issues, which can contain sensitive information about ongoing projects, security vulnerabilities, and internal discussions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted URL:** The attacker crafts a specific URL for the `bug_actiongroup_page.php` page, including the "COPY" action and the ID of the private issue within `bug_arr[]`. By manipulating the `bug_arr` parameter, even a user with low privileges, such as a VIEWER, can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **MantisBT User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the MantisBT system. The required access level is low, with even VIEWER accounts capable of exploiting the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Private Issue ID:** The attacker needs to know the ID of the private issue they intend to access.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability occurs in `bug_actiongroup_page.php` where the application iterates through the provided list of issue IDs (`bug_arr[]`). The vulnerability is fixed by adding an access check to ensure that the user has the required `view_bug_threshold` to access the issue. This is done by adding the following lines:

```php
    foreach( $f_bug_arr as $t_key => $t_bug_id ) {
        # Remove any issues the user doesn't have access to
        if( !access_has_bug_level( $t_view_bug_threshold, $t_bug_id ) ) {
            unset( $f_bug_arr[$t_key] );
            continue;
        }
        ...
    }

```
The fix ensures that issues that are not accessible to the user are removed from the list.

Additionally, the vulnerability fix includes an enhancement to cache the view_bug_threshold per project as the threshold can be different in each project.

```php
    # Per-project cache of the access threshold
    if( !isset( $t_view_bug_threshold[$t_bug->project_id] ) ) {
        $t_view_bug_threshold[$t_bug->project_id] = config_get(
            'view_bug_threshold',
            null,
            $t_user,
            $t_bug->project_id
        );
    }

    # Remove any issues the user doesn't have access to
    if( !access_has_bug_level( $t_view_bug_threshold[$t_bug->project_id], $t_bug_id ) ) {
        unset( $f_bug_arr[$t_key] );
        continue;
    }
```

**Additional details from the content:**

- The vulnerability was reported by d3vpoo1 and fixed by dregad.
- It was initially reported as part of a broader issue related to leaking private information but was later separated into distinct CVEs.
- The issue affects MantisBT versions prior to 2.24.4.

This detailed analysis provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its causes, and how it can be exploited.
