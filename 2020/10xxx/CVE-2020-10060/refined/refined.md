  "vulnerability": "CVE-2020-10060",
  "description": "UpdateHub Might Dereference An Uninitialized Pointer. In updatehub_probe, right after JSON parsing is complete, objects[1] is accessed from the output structure in two different places. If the JSON contained less than two elements, this access would reference uninitialized stack memory. This could result in a crash, denial of service, or possibly an information leak.",
  "affected_component": "UpdateHub",
  "root_cause": "The updatehub_probe function accesses `objects[1]` after parsing JSON, but if the JSON has less than two elements, `objects[1]` is uninitialized.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Uninitialized pointer dereference"
  ],
  "impact": "Crash, denial of service, or information leak.",
   "attack_vector": "A malformed JSON payload from an UpdateHub server.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send crafted JSON payloads to the vulnerable device running the UpdateHub client.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered during the `updatehub_probe` function when parsing a JSON response. The code accesses objects[1] in the output structure, which can be uninitialized if the server returns a JSON response with less than two elements. This results in a dereference of uninitialized memory, leading to a potential crash, denial of service or information leak."
