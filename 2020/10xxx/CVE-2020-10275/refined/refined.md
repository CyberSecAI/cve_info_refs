The provided content is related to CVE-2020-10275.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The access tokens for the REST API are derived directly from the publicly available default credentials for the web interface. The token string is generated using `base64(USERNAME:sha256(PASSWORD))`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Weak token generation algorithm.
- Use of default credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthorized attacker on the network can use the default credentials to compute the token.
- This allows the attacker to interact with the REST API to exfiltrate, infiltrate, or delete data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Exploiting publicly available default credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be inside the network where the vulnerable system is located.
- The attacker needs to know the default credentials of the system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple robot models from different vendors.
- The vulnerability has a critical severity rating (9.8 CVSS score and 10.0 RVSS score).
- The vulnerability was found during dynamic testing by Alias Robotics.
