{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `image-upload.php` file, which allows authenticated users (superuser, writer, translator, or editor) to upload a file, but does not properly sanitize the uploaded file's contents or file extension, leading to the possibility of uploading arbitrary PHP files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Improper file type validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "An authenticated attacker can upload a malicious PHP file disguised as an image using the `image-upload.php` endpoint.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have valid login credentials for a user with the Superuser/Writer/Translator/Editor role."
  }
