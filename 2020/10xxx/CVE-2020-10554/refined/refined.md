The provided content is related to CVE-2020-10554.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Passwords used to encrypt data are stored in an easily reversible obfuscated format within the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure storage of passwords in the database. The obfuscation method is weak and easily reversible.
-Passwords used for encryption are not stored using a proper hashing algorithm

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can retrieve encryption passwords from the database.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to encrypted data, potentially compromising sensitive information.
- Privilege escalation may be possible through access to encryption keys.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the database is required.
- Attackers can extract the obfuscated passwords using SQL queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to query the database.
- Attacker can be any user on the system that has access to the database.
