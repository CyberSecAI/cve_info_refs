The provided content is related to CVE-2020-10285.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a weak authentication implementation on the xArm controller, characterized by very low entropy. This makes the system susceptible to brute-force attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Weak authentication mechanism with low entropy.
- Lack of mechanisms to mitigate or lockout automated attempts.
- Absence of account lockout after multiple failed attempts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful brute-force attack could allow unauthorized access to the xArm controller.
-  Compromise of robot controller.
-  Potential unauthorized modification or control of the robot.
- The impact is rated as high severity.

**Attack vectors:**
- Brute-force attack.
- Exploitation of adjacent network access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to access the robot controller through adjacent networks.
- Ability to perform automated password guessing attempts.
