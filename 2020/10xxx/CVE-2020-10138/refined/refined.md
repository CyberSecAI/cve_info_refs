Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in **CVE-2020-10138**:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `OPENSSLDIR` variable within Acronis software. Specifically, the software's OpenSSL component is configured to use a directory path (`C:\jenkins_agent\`) which is not protected by access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **DLL Search Order Hijacking:** By placing a specially crafted `openssl.cnf` file in a directory that is searched before the legitimate OpenSSL configuration file, an attacker can control the OpenSSL configuration.
*   **Unprotected Directory:** The use of `C:\jenkins_agent\` or subdirectories within it, as the location for OpenSSL configuration, allows any unprivileged user to create directories and place malicious files there.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the OpenSSL configuration, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Acronis service that uses the vulnerable OpenSSL component. Since the Acronis service often runs with SYSTEM privileges, this can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged user can escalate their privileges to SYSTEM, gaining full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System:** An attacker places a malicious `openssl.cnf` file within the `C:\jenkins_agent\` or its subdirectories.
*   **DLL Search Order Hijacking:** The attacker leverages the DLL search order to load the malicious file by placing it in a location that the program will search before the legitimate location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the affected Windows system.
*   **File System Write Access:** The attacker needs the ability to create files and directories off of the system root (e.g., `C:\`).

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content is from the CERT vulnerability note (VU#114757), MITRE ATT&CK, and Acronis release notes.
*   The CERT note also mentions similar vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-10139 and CVE-2020-10140), but this breakdown focuses on CVE-2020-10138.
*   The MITRE ATT&CK content provides a broader context of DLL Search Order Hijacking, which this CVE exploits.
*   The Acronis release notes include the fix for the vulnerability in specific builds.
*   The vulnerability is also mentioned in the Acronis Cyber Protect 15 release notes, where it is described that the issue is related to a DLL injection vulnerability.
