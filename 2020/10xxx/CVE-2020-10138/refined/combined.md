Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load DLLs. Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program. [[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order?redirectedfrom=MSDN)[[2]](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2010/07/malware-persistence-windows-registry.html) Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution.

There are many ways an adversary can hijack DLL loads. Adversaries may plant trojan dynamic-link library files (DLLs) in a directory that will be searched before the location of a legitimate library that will be requested by a program, causing Windows to load their malicious library when it is called for by the victim program. Adversaries may also perform DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks, [[3]](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Binary_planting) by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL. Often this location is the current working directory of the program.[[4]](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2011/06/fxsst.html) Remote DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL. [[5]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securityadvisories/2010/2269637)

Phantom DLL hijacking is a specific type of DLL search order hijacking where adversaries target references to non-existent DLL files.[[6]](https://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2013/12/08/beyond-good-ol-run-key-part-5/)[[7]](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/4-ways-adversaries-hijack-dlls/) They may be able to load their own malicious DLL by planting it with the correct name in the location of the missing module.

Adversaries may also directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled (in the Registry and creation of a redirection file) may cause a program to load a different DLL.[[8]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-redirection?redirectedfrom=MSDN)[[9]](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/aa375365)[[10]](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2010/08/dll-search-order-hijacking-revisited.html)

If a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level. In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or from administrator to SYSTEM, depending on the program. Programs that fall victim to path hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace.

## Mitigations

| ID | Mitigation | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [M1047](/mitigations/M1047) | [Audit](/mitigations/M1047) | Use auditing tools capable of detecting DLL search order hijacking opportunities on systems within an enterprise and correct them. Toolkits like the PowerSploit framework contain PowerUp modules that can be used to explore systems for DLL hijacking weaknesses.[[46]](https://github.com/mattifestation/PowerSploit)  Use the program sxstrace.exe that is included with Windows along with manual inspection to check manifest files for side-by-side problems in software.[[47]](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sxstrace) |
| [M1038](/mitigations/M1038) | [Execution Prevention](/mitigations/M1038) | Adversaries may use new DLLs to execute this technique. Identify and block potentially malicious software executed through search order hijacking by using application control solutions capable of blocking DLLs loaded by legitimate software. |
| [M1044](/mitigations/M1044) | [Restrict Library Loading](/mitigations/M1044) | Disallow loading of remote DLLs. This is included by default in Windows Server 2012+ and is available by patch for XP+ and Server 2003+.  Enable Safe DLL Search Mode to force search for system DLLs in directories with greater restrictions (e.g. `%SYSTEMROOT%`)to be used before local directory DLLs (e.g. a user's home directory)  The Safe DLL Search Mode can be enabled via Group Policy at Computer Configuration > [Policies] > Administrative Templates > MSS (Legacy): MSS: (SafeDllSearchMode) Enable Safe DLL search mode. The associated Windows Registry key for this is located at `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\SafeDLLSearchMode`[[48]](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2010/08/23/more-information-about-the-dll-preloading-remote-attack-vector/)[[1]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order?redirectedfrom=MSDN) |

## Detection

| ID | Data Source | Data Component | Detects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [DS0022](/datasources/DS0022) | [File](/datasources/DS0022) | [File Creation](/datasources/DS0022/#File%20Creation) | Monitor newly constructed .manifest and .local redirection files that do not correlate with software updates. |
|  |  | [File Modification](/datasources/DS0022/#File%20Modification) | Monitor for changed made to .manifest/.local redirection files, or file systems for moving, renaming, replacing, or modifying DLLs. Changes in the set of DLLs that are loaded by a process (compared with past behavior) that do not correlate with known software, patches, etc., are suspicious. |
| [DS0011](/datasources/DS0011) | [Module](/datasources/DS0011) | [Module Load](/datasources/DS0011/#Module%20Load) | Monitor DLLs loaded into a process and detect DLLs that have the same file name but abnormal paths. |

## Acronis backup software contains multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#114757

Original Release Date: 2020-10-12 | Last Revised: 2020-10-12

---

### Overview

Acronis True Image, Cyber Backup, and Cyber Protection all contain privilege escalation vulnerabilities, which can allow an unprivileged Windows user to be able to run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

### Description

**CVE-2020-10138**

Acronis Cyber Backup 12.5 and Cyber Protect 15 include an OpenSSL component that specifies an `OPENSSLDIR` variable as a subdirectory within `C:\jenkins_agent\`. Acronis Cyber Backup and Cyber Protect contain a privileged service that uses this OpenSSL component. Because unprivileged Windows users can create subdirectories off of the system root, a user can create the appropriate path to a specially-crafted `openssl.cnf` file to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

**CVE-2020-10139**

Acronis True Image 2021 includes an OpenSSL component that specifies an `OPENSSLDIR` variable as a subdirectory within `C:\jenkins_agent\`. Acronis True Image contains a privileged service that uses this OpenSSL component. Because unprivileged Windows users can create subdirectories off of the system root, a user can create the appropriate path to a specially-crafted `openssl.cnf` file to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

**CVE-2020-10140**

Acronis True Image 2021 fails to properly set ACLs of the `C:\ProgramData\Acronis` directory. Because some privileged processes are executed from the `C:\ProgramData\Acronis` directory, an unprivileged user can achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges by placing a DLL in one of several paths within `C:\ProgramData\Acronis`.

### Impact

By placing a specially-crafted `openssl.cnf` or DLL file in a specific location, an unprivileged user may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a Windows system with the vulnerable Acronis software installed. See [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/) for more details.

### Solution

#### Apply an update

These vulnerabilities are addressed in Acronis True Image 2021 build 32010 ([release notes](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/support/updates/changes.html?p=42226)), Acronis Cyber Backup 12.5 build 16363 ([release notes](https://dl.managed-protection.com/u/backup/rn/12.5/user/en-US/AcronisBackup12.5_relnotes.htm)), and Acronis Cyber Protect 15 build 24600 ([release notes](https://dl.managed-protection.com/u/cyberprotect/rn/15/user/en-US/AcronisCyberProtect15_relnotes.htm)).

### Application-aware backup for VMs on Hyper-V

The new application-aware backup of Hyper-V VMs by the Agent for Hyper-V improves the backup and recovery of Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft SharePoint, and Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services running on Microsoft Hyper-V.

### Finalizing the virtual machine running from backup on Hyper-V

While a virtual machine is running from a backup, the virtual disks content is taken directly from its backup. Therefore, the machine will become inaccessible or even corrupted if the connection is lost to the backup location or to the backup agent. You have the option to make this machine permanent, that is, recover all of its virtual disks, along with the changes that occurred while the machine was running, to the datastore that stores these changes. This process is named finalization.

This process is now supported for both ESXi and Hyper-V.

### Installation and upgrade

* [ABR-325252] Agent for Hyper-V cannot be re-registered on the management server via "Devices" â "Add" if it was successfully installed and removed before.

  Solution: restart the Acronis services on the agent before registration attempt.

* [ABR-218875] When Acronis Cyber Protect 15 is uninstalled without using "Remove the logs and configuration settings" option and installed under new user, then new backup plans creation would fail with "Windows error: (0x80070005) Access is denied" error

  Solution: Uninstall Acronis Cyber Protect 15 without using "Remove the logs and configuration settings" option and install specifying the same existing user account which was used for the 1st initial installation.
* [ABR-217534] When the backup agent is installed using HTTP proxy it still requires that the hostnames of Acronis Cloud servers (for example "baas-fes-us3.acronis.com") are resolved properly from the agent side, even if DNS redirection is set up within the proxy server.
* [ABR-144289] Deployment of Acronis Cyber Protect Backup Appliance (All-in-One) from OVF template onto ESXi hosts versions 5.1 or lower produces VM with wrong guest OS type: "Other (32-bit)" which causes appliance malfunction.

  Solution: Change the guest OS type of the appliance VM to "Other 3.x or later Linux (64-bit)" via vSphere client.
* [ABR-143693] Deployment of Acronis Cyber Protect Backup Appliance (All-in-One) from OVF template does not work when using vSphere Web Client on vCenter version 6.5 U1 build 5973321, since this version of vCenter does not support deployment from OVF templates (only OVA format is supported)

  Solution: Prepare the virtual machine for Acronis Backup appliance installation manually as described in documentation and boot it from Acronis Backup appliance ISO to proceed with the installation.
* [ABR-142841] Acronis Cyber Protect Backup Appliance (All-in-One) ISO cannot boot on EFI systems

  Solution: use BIOS systems.
* [ABR-142560] Deployment of Acronis Cyber Protect Backup Appliance (All-in-One) from OVF template does not work when using vSphere Host Client on ESXi version 6.5 with error: "A required disk image was missing"

  Solution: Either perform OVF deployment using vSphere Web Client instead of vSphere Host Client OR prepare the virtual machine for Acronis Cyber Protect Backup Appliance (All-in-One) installation manually as described in documentation and boot it from Acronis Cyber Protect Backup Appliance (All-in-One) ISO to proceed with the installation.
* [ABR-131165] Simultaneous upgrade of multiple Virtual Appliances in the backup console is not possible.

  Solution: update Virtual Appliances one by one.
* [ABR-130409] A machine may not appear on the Devices tab after Acronis Backup agent installation if the Acronis Backup Management Server host name cannot be resolved to IP from the machine where the agent is installed. The following error message appears in the installation log: "Could not resolve host: [HOSTNAME]; Host not found".

  Solution: When deploying an agent to a machine use the new GUI option to define the management server registration address which will be used by the agent (host name or IP). Alternatively ensure that the management server is accessible by its host name from the machine with the agent.

* [ABR-118182] In some cases, installation may hang at 96% for an period of time up to 10-20 minutes because of the Microsoft.VC90.CRT runtime package installation. The main symptom is the Windows Modules Installer (TiWorker.exe) process constantly consuming CPU resources.

### Common

* [PLTFRM-18969] It is not possible to protect Microsoft SQL on a machine with a workstation operating system, in the case Agent for Hyper-V is also installed among local agents.
* [ABR-279757] Applying a protection plan to Agent for Windows installed on Windows Server 2008 (32 bit) always fails.

* [ABR-133689] Acronis MMS fails to start on the latest version of CentOS 7 that uses the 3.10.0-514.21.2.el7.x86\_64 kernel version, due to the specific kernel bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=1463241.
* [ABR-128209] After unmounting a volume mounted from a backup in the read/write mode, a new recovery point is added, even if the mounted volume was not modified. The root cause is that Windows automatically discovers newly appeared volumes and applies metadata changes to them, which forces Acronis Backup 12.5 to preserve these changes in a new recovery point during unmounting.
* [ABR-127363] The cleanup rule By total size of backups is not available in the backup console if the backup destination is Acronis Cloud Storage.
* [ABR-121236] Exporting multiple plans from the Plans tab does not work.

The following error appears: "You do not have access rights to this file."

  Solution: Configure network settings at the Acronis Backup agent, by configuring the DNS or modifying the /etc/hosts file, to allow name resolution to work properly. To verify if the ESXi host can be resolved, run the following command on the machine with the backup agent: ping <ESXi host name>.
* [ABR-104081] A VM replication plan execution may fail in unstable network environments even if the "Error handling" option is enabled.
* [ABR-100551] Backup of a Linux virtual machine running on Hyper-V 2019 always fails over to crash-consistent snapshots, due to a Microsoft limitation (inability to create production checkpoints for Linux virtual machines).
* [ABR-96496] Acronis Backup Agent for VMware (Windows) disables Windows NFS server functions when installed on Windows Server 2012, due to the ports conflict.

  Solution: Deploy Agent for VMware (Virtual Appliance) to the target ESX host or install Agent for VMware (Windows) on another machine with the NFS server functionality disabled.
