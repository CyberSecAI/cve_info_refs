  "CVE-2020-10723": {
    "description": "The vulnerability exists in the `vhost_user_check_and_alloc_queue_pair()` function within the DPDK's `librte_vhost` library. This function is used to extract a vring index from a payload and validates the index. The vring index is stored in a uint16, even though the source can be a wider unsigned integer. This integer truncation can lead to the top 16 bits of the index not being validated. When these truncated indices are used later (e.g. in `vhost_user_set_vring_num()` or `vhost_user_set_vring_addr()`), out-of-bounds indexing can occur, leading to memory corruption.",
    "root_cause": "Integer truncation when storing a vring index from a larger unsigned integer into a uint16_t within `vhost_user_check_and_alloc_queue_pair()`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer truncation",
      "Out-of-bounds indexing due to insufficient validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Memory corruption due to out-of-bounds writes, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted messages to the vhost-user backend",
       "A malicious guest or container having direct access to the vhost-user socket"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious guest or container needs to be able to send crafted vhost-user messages to trigger the vulnerability. High privileges are required within the context of the vhost-user backend process."
