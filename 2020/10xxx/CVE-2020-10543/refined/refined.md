{
  "CVE-2020-10543": {
    "description": "Perl before 5.30.3 on 32-bit platforms allows a heap-based buffer overflow because nested regular expression quantifiers have an integer overflow.",
    "root_cause": "A signed size_t integer overflow in the storage space calculations for nested regular expression quantifiers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "heap buffer overflow",
      "integer overflow"

    "impact": "The heap overflow could overwrite memory allocated after the regular expression storage space with attacker supplied data, potentially leading to denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "crafted regular expression"

    "required_capabilities": "Ability to supply/control a regular expression to be compiled by Perl regex engine; unlikely to be met on 64-bit systems."

  "CVE-2020-10878": {
    "description": "Perl before 5.30.3 has an integer overflow related to mishandling of a \"PL_regkind[OP(n)] == NOTHING\" situation. A crafted regular expression could lead to malformed bytecode with a possibility of instruction injection.",

      "integer overflow",
