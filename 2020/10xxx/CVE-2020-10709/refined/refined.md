Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-10709:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Ansible Tower handles OAuth2 refresh tokens. Specifically, the refresh tokens do not adhere to the expiration time specified by the `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_SECONDS` setting.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unexpiring Refresh Tokens:** The primary vulnerability is the creation of refresh tokens that do not expire, effectively granting indefinite access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Persistent Access:** An attacker who obtains an unexpiring refresh token can maintain full authentication to Ansible Tower indefinitely.
- **Account takeover:** By gaining access to a refresh token, an attacker can gain full access to the resources of the corresponding user.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to somehow obtain a valid refresh token. This could potentially happen through phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, or by gaining access to a compromised system.
- Once they have a refresh token, they can use it to maintain access to the Ansible Tower.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to obtain a refresh token that was generated by Ansible Tower. This requires either having existing access to the system, or gaining access to credentials in some way.
- The attacker would need to be able to use the refresh token to authenticate to Ansible Tower.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected versions include Ansible Tower 3.5.5 and 3.6.3, as well as previous versions.
- Mitigation includes deleting the user from Ansible Tower to invalidate their tokens.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Ansible Tower 3.6.4 and 3.5.6.
- The upstream fix is available at the provided GitHub link: `<https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/6630>`.
