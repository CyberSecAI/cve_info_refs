{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The arm platform-specific code uses a signed integer comparison when validating system call numbers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of signed integer comparison for syscall validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who has obtained code execution within a user thread is able to elevate privileges to that of the kernel.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Code execution within a user thread"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Code execution within a user thread is required.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists because the system call number validation uses a signed integer comparison instead of an unsigned comparison, allowing a user thread to pass a large negative syscall number and bypass the check. This allows a user thread to elevate privileges to that of the kernel."
