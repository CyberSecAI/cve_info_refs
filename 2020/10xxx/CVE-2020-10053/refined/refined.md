- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application writes sensitive data, specifically database credentials, in configuration files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker with access to the configuration files can use the exposed database credentials to launch further attacks. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the database and manipulation of data.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the server where the application is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to read the configuration files.
