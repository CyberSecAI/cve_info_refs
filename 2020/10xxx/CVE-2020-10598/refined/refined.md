- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected BD medical devices use a "kiosk mode" for software application implementation. This mode is vulnerable to local breakouts due to insufficient restrictions on user input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Protection Mechanism Failure (CWE-693). The kiosk mode fails to properly restrict user access, allowing specially crafted inputs to bypass the restricted environment.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker with physical access to bypass the kiosk mode, potentially leading to the viewing and/or modification of sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is physical access to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires physical access to the affected device and the ability to craft specific inputs to escape the kiosk mode. This does not require high skill level to achieve.
