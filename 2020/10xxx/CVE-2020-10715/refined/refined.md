Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10715:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization/validation in the OpenShift web console, specifically how it handles URLs. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary text into error pages by crafting a malicious URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Content Spoofing/Text Injection:** The vulnerability allows for the injection of arbitrary text into error pages. This is a form of content spoofing, where the attacker can manipulate the content displayed to the user to look legitimate.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The application does not sufficiently sanitize or validate the input it receives from the URL, which leads to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Deception:** An attacker can inject text that appears to be from the OpenShift instance, which can mislead users into believing the injected text is legitimate. This could be used for social engineering attacks, such as phishing or delivering false information.
*   **Potential for Phishing:** While not explicitly stated, this could enable a phishing attack by displaying a fake error page with deceptive information that could trick users into revealing credentials or taking other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URL:** The primary attack vector is a crafted URL containing the malicious text, which is then displayed on an error page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to generate and distribute URLs containing malicious payloads.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires the victim to visit the crafted URL, which will then display the injected text on the error page.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects OpenShift web console versions 3.11 and 4.x.
*   The fix involved updating how error messages are handled, to prevent the injection.
*   The fix has been implemented in versions of OpenShift Container Platform via RHSA-2020:2992 (for version 3.11) and RHSA-2020:4298 (for version 4.6).
*   The upstream fix is available at: `https://github.com/openshift/origin-web-console/pull/3173`

In summary, CVE-2020-10715 is a content spoofing vulnerability in the OpenShift web console, which could be exploited through a specially crafted URL to inject arbitrary text into error pages, potentially deceiving users.
