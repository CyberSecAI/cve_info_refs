Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `cvmd` service of DrayTek routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `sub_11FB8` function within the `cvmd` service copies data from the `Authorization` header into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking. Specifically, the function extracts the value associated with a given key in the Authorization header and copies it into a temporary buffer of size `0x64`. If the extracted value exceeds this length, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite parts of the stack, including the return address, allowing them to redirect the execution flow and potentially achieve remote code execution on the vulnerable device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/ACSServer/services/ACSServlet` endpoint of the `cvmd` service.
*   **Authorization Header Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `Authorization` header in the HTTP request, specifically overflowing the buffer used to store a value extracted from this header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device to send the malicious HTTP requests.
*   **No Authentication:** The vulnerability is triggered in the context of handling authorization, but it occurs before authentication is fully checked.
*   **Knowledge of API endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable service path `/ACSServer/services/ACSServlet`
