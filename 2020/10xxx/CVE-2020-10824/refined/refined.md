Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10824:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `/cgi-bin/activate.cgi` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The script copies the value of the `ticket` parameter into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking. Specifically, the `memcpy` operation does not validate the length of the input before copying data to `static_buf_ticket` causing a buffer overflow if the `ticket` parameter is larger than the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the stack and control the program's execution flow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/activate.cgi` endpoint.
- **`ticket` parameter:** The attack vector is specifically the `ticket` parameter within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided information includes proof-of-concept (PoC) code using `curl` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerable code snippet utilizes `memcpy` without proper bounds checking when processing the `ticket` parameter.
- The `static_buf_ticket` buffer is of size `0x200` bytes. Sending a `ticket` value larger than this will cause the overflow.
- The affected products are Vigor3900, Vigor2960, and Vigor300B before version 1.5.1.
