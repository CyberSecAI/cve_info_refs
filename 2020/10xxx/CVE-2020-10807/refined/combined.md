## Description

![@lukasmahl](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13811302?v=4&size=48)[lukasmahl](https://github.com/lukasmahl)opened [on Mar 18, 2020](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/issues/1405#issue-583800223)

Hi guys,

While checking our your API I've found a serious security flaw, which allows any unauthenticated user to perform any kind of API requests, which basically makes the whole tool and therefore any agents on end hosts exposable to anyone having access to the Caldera REST API.

The following function is responsible for checking authentication in your code:

```
async def check_permissions(self, group, request):
        """
        Check if a request is allowed based on the user permissions
        :param request:
        :return: None
        """
        try:
            if request.headers.get('KEY') == self.get_config('api_key'):
                return True
            elif self.bypass in request.host:
                return True
            await check_permission(request, group)
        except (HTTPUnauthorized, HTTPForbidden):
            raise web.HTTPFound('/login')
```

Basically it allows to bypass authentication if `self.bypass` is contained within `request.host` (which is set to `localhost:` per default). You are using the aiohttp library, in which `host` is usually the Host header of the http request (see <https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/v3.0.1/web_reference.html>).

This works fine if you are performing a curl request from localhost for example, but be aware that the HTTP Host header is mutable for any request performed by a user. So if you just overwrite the Host header with "localhost:8888" while performing a request to a public IP for example Caldera assumes you are performing the request to localhost and therefore disables authentication checks.

Here is a POC in Postman:

[![Screenshot 2020-03-18 at 15 53 51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13811302/76975457-d91c1900-6932-11ea-8b14-5579202e5769.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13811302/76975457-d91c1900-6932-11ea-8b14-5579202e5769.png)

Body of the request:

[![Screenshot 2020-03-18 at 15 53 59](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13811302/76975492-e6390800-6932-11ea-9cf3-fba3a08a9e7b.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13811302/76975492-e6390800-6932-11ea-9cf3-fba3a08a9e7b.png)

Response:

[![Screenshot 2020-03-18 at 15 54 06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13811302/76975509-edf8ac80-6932-11ea-8886-bf80b142ad24.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13811302/76975509-edf8ac80-6932-11ea-8886-bf80b142ad24.png)

As you can see I've succesfully performed an API request while using a IP within my network and not localhost. I've set the Host header to localhost and were able to fetch details without any authentication.

That really is a serious flaw in the application, if I have running productive agents an attacker can execute arbitrary commands in my network. I'd suggest removing the no-authentication "feature" for requests to localhost completely.

Thanks!

## Big features

* A new plugin, Training, has been added. This plugin allows a user to gain a "User Certificate" which proves their ability to use CALDERA. This is the first of several certificates planned in the future. The plugin takes you through a capture-the-flag style certification course, covering all parts CALDERA.

## Small features

* You can now delete adversaries from the GUI, through a new 'delete adversary' button
* You can now create mini-ability YML files called "extensions". An extension is simply the ID + platforms sections of a given ability and can be stored as a separate file from the full ability file (which contain names, descriptions, ATT&CK info, etc). Extensions are helpful because they allow you to store custom platforms/executors in a separate plugin then the normal ones.

## Plugin changes:

### Stockpile

* We added two new obfuscators, base64\_no\_padding.py and caeser cipher. The former obfuscates commands by base64 encoding them and removing any padding. The latter obfuscates commands by applying a cipher which uses a shift key to change the ordinal char of each byte.

## Breaking changes:

We expect plugin developers to only interact with the core system (and other plugins) through the list of services passed to their plugin and through importing the c\_[object] modules in the core code. As such, each release we will highlight the changes in these two areas, as they could introduce breaking changes to a plugin.

### Services

#### auth\_svc

* A bug was fixed where we were using a convenience "bypass" of authentication for localhost.

### Objects

#### c\_agent

* a new function (privileged\_to\_run) was added, which accepts a given ability and returns whether the agent is privileged to run it or not.

### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff 2.6.4...2.6.5`
