The content is related to CVE-2020-10807.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flawed authentication check in the Caldera application's API. The application incorrectly allows requests to bypass authentication if the `Host` header of an HTTP request contains the string defined in the `self.bypass` variable, which is set to `localhost:` by default.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a bypass of authentication. Specifically, the application uses the `Host` header for authentication checks, which is mutable and can be easily manipulated by an attacker. The application allows unauthenticated access if the `Host` header contains the `self.bypass` string, which defaults to 'localhost:'.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can bypass authentication and execute arbitrary API requests without needing to authenticate. This can lead to an attacker being able to execute arbitrary commands on the target network by leveraging the compromised Caldera instance.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through sending HTTP requests to the Caldera server with a modified `Host` header containing the string "localhost:". The attacker does not need to be on the same host as the Caldera server, nor does the attacker need a valid authentication key.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the Caldera server. The attacker does not need any valid authentication credentials and can be located anywhere with network access to the Caldera server.
