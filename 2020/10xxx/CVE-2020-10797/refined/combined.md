### diag\_ping.php: Potential XSS via Hostname parameter

**Description**

On diag\_ping.php, the hostname isn't fully validated and the output is not encoded, leading to a potential XSS.

Using an input such as the following example demonstrates the problem:

```

127.0.0.1 <img src='' onerror='alert()'>

```

# 2.4.5 New Features and Changes[Â¶](#new-features-and-changes "Link to this heading")

pfSenseÂ® software version 2.4.5 contains a variety of bug fixes and maintenance
updates.

Warning

**Proceed with caution when upgrading pfSense software while COVID-19 travel
restrictions are in effect.**

During this time of travel limitations, remote upgrades of pfSense software
should be carefully considered, and avoided where possible. Travel
restrictions may complicate any repair of any issue, including
hardware-related issues that render the system unreachable. Should these
issues require onsite physical access to remedy, repair of the issue may not
be possible while travel restrictions related to COVID-19 are in effect.

Tip

For those who have not yet updated to 2.4.5-p1, consult the [previous
release notes](index.html) and [blog posts for those releases](https://www.netgate.com/blog/tag/releases) to read all important
information and warnings before proceeding.
