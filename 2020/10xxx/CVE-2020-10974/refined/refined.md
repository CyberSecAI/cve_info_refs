Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10974:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the insecure implementation of the configuration backup functionality in certain Wavlink devices. Specifically, the backup process does not require authentication, and it returns the device's configuration in cleartext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The backup functionality can be accessed without any authentication.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The device configuration, including the administrator password, is exposed in cleartext in the backup file.
*   **Lack of Encryption:** The configuration file is not encrypted when it's downloaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to the administrator password and other sensitive configuration data.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Indirect):** The disclosed administrator password can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities (such as CVE-2020-10971) to achieve remote code execution. This allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** A simple crafted HTTP POST request to the page that retrieves the configuration triggers the vulnerable script. This script downloads the configuration file, which is in plain text.
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple Wavlink device models, including WL-WN579G3 and WL-WN575A3.
*   The disclosed password can be used to create a new administrator session without relying on an existing user login.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by James Clee, who reported it to Wavlink, but received no response.

**Affected Devices:**
*   Wavlink WN575A3
*   Wavlink WN579G3
*   Wavlink WN531A6
*   Wavlink WN535G3
*   Wavlink WN530H4
*   Wavlink WN57X93
*   Wavlink WN572HG3
*    Wavlink WN575A4
*    Wavlink WN578A2
*    Wavlink WN579X3
*   Jetstream AC3000/ERAC3000
