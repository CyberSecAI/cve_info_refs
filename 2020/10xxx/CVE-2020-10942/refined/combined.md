vhost: Check docket sk\_family instead of call getnameDoing so, we save one call to get data we already have in the struct.
Also, since there is no guarantee that getname use sockaddr\_ll
parameter beyond its size, we add a little bit of security here.
It should do not do beyond MAX\_ADDR\_LEN, but syzbot found that
ax25\_getname writes more (72 bytes, the size of full\_sockaddr\_ax25,
versus 20 + 32 bytes of sockaddr\_ll + MAX\_ADDR\_LEN in syzbot repro).

# USN-4344-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

28 April 2020

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [linux-gke-5.0](/security/cves?package=linux-gke-5.0) - Linux kernel for Google Container Engine (GKE) systems
* [linux-oem-osp1](/security/cves?package=linux-oem-osp1) - Linux kernel for OEM processors

## Details

It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-16234](/security/CVE-2019-16234))

It was discovered that the Intel WiMAX 2400 driver in the Linux kernel did

not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19051](/security/CVE-2019-19051))

Tristan Madani discovered that the block I/O tracing implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2019-19768](/security/CVE-2019-19768))

It was discovered that the vhost net driver in the Linux kernel contained a

stack buffer overflow. A local attacker with the ability to perform ioctl()

calls on /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2020-10942](/security/CVE-2020-10942))

It was discovered that the virtual terminal implementation in the Linux

kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-8648](/security/CVE-2020-8648))

Shijie Luo discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly check for a too-large journal size. An attacker

could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted,

could cause a denial of service (soft lockup). ([CVE-2020-8992](/security/CVE-2020-8992))

Jordy Zomer discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2020-9383](/security/CVE-2020-9383))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-5.0.0-1035-gke](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-gke-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.0-1035.36](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-gke-5.0/5.0.0-1035.36)
* [linux-image-5.0.0-1050-oem-osp1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-oem-osp1)
  -
  [5.0.0-1050.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-signed-oem-osp1/5.0.0-1050.55)
* [linux-image-gke-5.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-gke-5.0)
  -
  [5.0.0.1035.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-gke-5.0/5.0.0.1035.23)
* [linux-image-oem-osp1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-oem-osp1)
  -
  [5.0.0.1050.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-oem-osp1/5.0.0.1050.53)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Debian Bug     : 952660

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-2182

    Hanjun Guo and Lei Li reported a race condition in the arm64
    virtual memory management code, which could lead to an information
    disclosure, denial of service (crash), or possibly privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11
    (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger
    roaming for a newly associated station before the station was
    authenticated.  An attacker within range of the AP could use this
    to cause a denial of service, either by filling up a switching
    table or by redirecting traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
    implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks.  A user
    permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19462

    The syzbot tool found a missing error check in the 'relay'
    library used to implement various files under debugfs.  A local
    user permitted to access debugfs could use this to cause a denial
    of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
    facility that could result in a use-after-free.  A local user able
    to trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20806

    A potential null pointer dereference was discovered in the tw5864
    media driver.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-20811

    The Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an error
    path in the network subsystem.  The security impact of this is
    unclear.

CVE-2020-0543

    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
    supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random
    value generated by these instructions may be used in a later
    speculative execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by applications, a
    local user or VM guest could use this to obtain sensitive
    information such as cryptographic keys from other users or VMs.

    This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either
    as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
    package in Debian's non-free archive section.  This kernel update
    only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
    disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

CVE-2020-2732

    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2
    guests when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an
    L2 guest to cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or
    information leaks in the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8428

    Al Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the filesystem
    core (vfs).  A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash) or possibly to obtain sensitive information from
    the kernel.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in
    the vgacon driver.  A local user permitted to access a virtual
    terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
    driver, which could result in a use-after-free.  A local user
    permitted to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
    which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access.  A local user
    permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-10711

    Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues in the
    SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet with null category. A
    remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of
    service (crash). Note that this issue does not affect the binary
    packages distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

CVE-2020-10732

    An information leak of kernel private memory to userspace was found
    in the kernel's implementation of core dumping userspace processes.

CVE-2020-10751

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
    handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
    attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10757

    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX hugepages,
    allowing a local user to escalate their privileges

CVE-2020-10942

    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly
    validate the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user
    permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack
    corruption via crafted system calls, resulting in denial of
    service (crash) or possibly privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver
    did not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets,
    resulting in an information leak from the kernel to user-space or
    over the CAN network.

CVE-2020-11565

    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did
    not correctly handle an "mpol" mount option specifying an empty
    node list, leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user
    namespaces are enabled, a local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
    drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors.  A
    physically present user with a specially constructed USB device
    could use this to cause a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
    pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs).  A local user
    with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can
    result in a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this can be
    exploited, but it could result in a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers.
    An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice,
    creating a race condition which could result in incorrect locking
    of internal data structures.  A local user permitted to access
    /dev/mptctl could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap
    buffer overflow.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an access point
    (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer overflow.  A malicious AP
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12770

    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not
    correctly release internal resources in a particular error case.
    A local user permitted to access an sg device could possibly use
    this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-13143

    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in
    the USB gadget subsystem.  A local user permitted to write to
    the gadget configuration filesystem could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or potentially
    for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.210-1+deb9u1~deb8u1.  This version also fixes some related bugs
that do not have their own CVE IDs, and a regression in the macvlan
driver introduced in the previous security update (bug #952660).

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

# CVE-2019-19770

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-19769.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-19783.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-19770 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19770)

#### Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* In the Linux kernel 4.19.83, there is a use-after-free (read) in the debugfs\_remove function in fs/debugfs/inode.c (which is used to remove a file or directory in debugfs that was previously created with a call to another debugfs function such as debugfs\_create\_file). NOTE: Linux kernel developers dispute this issue as not being an issue with debugfs, instead this is an issue with misuse of debugfs within blktrace.

## Details

Al Viro discovered that the Linux kernel for s390x systems did not properly

perform page table upgrades for kernel sections that use secondary address

mode. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-11884](/security/CVE-2020-11884))

It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-16234](/security/CVE-2019-16234))

Tristan Madani discovered that the block I/O tracing implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2019-19768](/security/CVE-2019-19768))

It was discovered that the vhost net driver in the Linux kernel contained a

stack buffer overflow. A local attacker with the ability to perform ioctl()

calls on /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2020-10942](/security/CVE-2020-10942))

It was discovered that the OV51x USB Camera device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2020-11608](/security/CVE-2020-11608))

It was discovered that the STV06XX USB Camera device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2020-11609](/security/CVE-2020-11609))

It was discovered that the Xirlink C-It USB Camera device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2020-11668](/security/CVE-2020-11668))

It was discovered that the virtual terminal implementation in the Linux

kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-8648](/security/CVE-2020-8648))

Jordy Zomer discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2020-9383](/security/CVE-2020-9383))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-8839

    A race condition was found in the ext4 filesystem implementation.
    A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (filesystem corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes
    could trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access.
    An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11
    (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger
    roaming for a newly associated station before the station was
    authenticated.  An attacker within range of the AP could use this
    to cause a denial of service, either by filling up a switching
    table or by redirecting traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
    implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks.  A user
    permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
    handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
    already has a link count of 0.  An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
    facility that could result in a use-after-free.  A local user able
    to trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

    The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully
    validate keycode changes, which could result in a heap
    out-of-bounds write.  A local user permitted to access the device
    node for an input or VT device could possibly use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

    Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
    read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
    read-write.  However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian
    kernel configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
    supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random
    value generated by these instructions may be used in a later
    speculative execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by applications, a
    local user or VM guest could use this to obtain sensitive
    information such as cryptographic keys from other users or VMs.

    This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either
    as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
    package in Debian's non-free archive section.  This kernel update
    only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
    disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

    Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top
    of IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by
    IPsec, IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility.  This could result
    in disclosure of information over the network, since it would not
    be encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2
    guests when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an
    L2 guest to cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or
    information leaks in the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in
    the vgacon driver.  A local user permitted to access a virtual
    terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
    driver, which could result in a use-after-free.  A local user
    permitted to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
    which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access.  A local user
    permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

    It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
    properly manage device lifetimes.  Removing a PTP hardware clock
    from the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
    use-after-free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
    handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
    attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly
    validate the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user
    permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack
    corruption via crafted system calls, resulting in denial of
    service (crash) or possibly privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver
    did not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets,
    resulting in an information leak from the kernel to user-space or
    over the CAN network.

CVE-2020-11565

    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did
    not correctly handle an "mpol" mount option specifying an empty
    node list, leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user
    namespaces are enabled, a local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
    drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors.  A
    physically present user with a specially constructed USB device
    could use this to cause a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
    pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs).  A local user
    with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can
    result in a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this can be
    exploited, but it could result in a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers.
    An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice,
    creating a race condition which could result in incorrect locking
    of internal data structures.  A local user permitted to access
    /dev/mptctl could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap
    buffer overflow.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an access point
    (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer overflow.  A malicious AP
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

    It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
    serialise access to its internal state.  The security impact of
    this is unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's
    binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not
    correctly release internal resources in a particular error case.
    A local user permitted to access an sg device could possibly use
    this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

    Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's
    permission checks.  A parent process can choose an arbitary signal
    for a child process to send when it exits, but if the parent has
    executed a new program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent.  A
    local user permitted to run a program for several days could
    bypass this check, execute a setuid program, and then send an
    arbitrary signal to it.  Depending on the setuid programs
    installed, this could have some security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in
    the USB gadget subsystem.  A local user permitted to write to
    the gadget configuration filesystem could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or potentially
    for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.84-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.  Binary packages for
the EABI ARM (armel) architecture are not yet available, and a separate
announcement will be made when they are.

Subject: CVE-2020-10942 Kernel: vhost-net: stack overflow in get_raw_socket
 while checking sk_family field

   Hello,

A stack buffer overflow issue was found in the get_raw_socket() routine of the
Host kernel accelerator for virtio net (vhost-net) driver. It could occur
while doing an ioctl(VHOST_NET_SET_BACKEND) call and retrieving socket name in
a kernel stack variable via get_raw_socket(). A user able to perform ioctl(2)
calls on the '/dev/vhost-net' device may use this flaw to crash the kernel
resulting in DoS issue.

Upstream patch:
   -> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/42d84c8490f9f0931786f1623191fcab397c3d64>

Reference:
   -> <https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/2/15/125>

CVE-2020-10942 assigned via -> <https://cveform.mitre.org/>

Thank you.

#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

operand corresponds to an unsupported VMCS field before it checks to
see if the secondary source operand corresponds to a VM-exit

mm, thp: fix defrag setting if newline is not used
commit f42f25526502d851d0e3ca1e46297da8aafce8a7 upstream.
If thp defrag setting "defer" is used and a newline is \*not\* used when
writing to the sysfs file, this is interpreted as the "defer+madvise"
option.
This is because we do prefix matching and if five characters are written
without a newline, the current code ends up comparing to the first five
bytes of the "defer+madvise" option and using that instead.
Use the more appropriate sysfs\_streq() that handles the trailing newline
for us. Since this doubles as a nice cleanup, do it in enabled\_store()
as well.
The current implementation relies on prefix matching: the number of
bytes compared is either the number of bytes written or the length of
the option being compared. With a newline, "defer\n" does not match
"defer+"madvise"; without a newline, however, "defer" is considered to
match "defer+madvise" (prefix matching is only comparing the first five
bytes). End result is that writing "defer" is broken unless it has an
additional trailing character.
This means that writing "madv" in the past would match and set
"madvise". With strict checking, that no longer is the case but it is
unlikely anybody is currently doing this.

mm/gup: allow FOLL\_FORCE for get\_user\_pages\_fast()
commit f4000fdf435b8301a11cf85237c561047f8c4c72 upstream.
Commit 817be129e6f2 ("mm: validate get\_user\_pages\_fast flags") allowed
only FOLL\_WRITE and FOLL\_LONGTERM to be passed to get\_user\_pages\_fast().
This, combined with the fact that get\_user\_pages\_fast() falls back to
"slow gup", which \*does\* accept FOLL\_FORCE, leads to an odd situation:
if you need FOLL\_FORCE, you cannot call get\_user\_pages\_fast().
There does not appear to be any reason for filtering out FOLL\_FORCE.
There is nothing in the \_fast() implementation that requires that we
avoid writing to the pages. So it appears to have been an oversight.
Fix by allowing FOLL\_FORCE to be set for get\_user\_pages\_fast().

inadvertently removed printing of page flags for pages that are neither

Using pr\_cont() again would be a solution, but the commit explicitly
removed its use. Avoiding the danger of mixing up split lines from
multiple CPUs might be beneficial for near-panic dumps like this, so fix
this without reintroducing pr\_cont().

thermal: brcmstb\_thermal: Do not use DT coefficients
commit e1ff6fc22f19e2af8adbad618526b80067911d40 upstream.
At the time the brcmstb\_thermal driver and its binding were merged, the
DT binding did not make the coefficients properties a mandatory one,
therefore all users of the brcmstb\_thermal driver out there have a non
functional implementation with zero coefficients. Even if these
properties were provided, the formula used for computation is incorrect.
The coefficients are entirely process specific (right now, only 28nm is
supported) and not board or SoC specific, it is therefore appropriate to
hard code them in the driver given the compatibility string we are
probed with which has to be updated whenever a new process is
introduced.
We remove the existing coefficients definition since subsequent patches
are going to add support for a new process and will introduce new
coefficients as well.

\_\_kernel\_ino\_t is "unsigned long" on most architectures, but not on

commit 4bc6b745e5cbefed92c48071e28a5f41246d0470 upstream.
The current expedited RCU grace-period code expects that a task
requesting an expedited grace period cannot awaken until that grace
period has reached the wakeup phase. However, it is possible for a long
preemption to result in the waiting task never sleeping. For example,
consider the following sequence of events:
1. Task A starts an expedited grace period by invoking
synchronize\_rcu\_expedited(). It proceeds normally up to the
wait\_event() near the end of that function, and is then preempted
(or interrupted or whatever).
2. The expedited grace period completes, and a kworker task starts
the awaken phase, having incremented the counter and acquired
the rcu\_state structure's .exp\_wake\_mutex. This kworker task
is then preempted or interrupted or whatever.
3. Task A resumes and enters wait\_event(), which notes that the
expedited grace period has completed, and thus doesn't sleep.
4. Task B starts an expedited grace period exactly as did Task A,
complete with the preemption (or whatever delay) just before
the call to wait\_event().
5. The expedited grace period completes, and another kworker
task starts the awaken phase, having incremented the counter.
However, it blocks when attempting to acquire the rcu\_state
structure's .exp\_wake\_mutex because step 2's kworker task has
not yet released it.
6. Steps 4 and 5 repeat, resulting in overflow of the rcu\_node
structure's ->exp\_wq[] array.
In theory, this is harmless. Tasks waiting on the various ->exp\_wq[]
array will just be spuriously awakened, but they will just sleep again
on noting that the rcu\_state structure's ->expedited\_sequence value has
not advanced far enough.
In practice, this wastes CPU time and is an accident waiting to happen.
This commit therefore moves the rcu\_exp\_gp\_seq\_end() call that officially
ends the expedited grace period (along with associate tracing) until
after the ->exp\_wake\_mutex has been acquired. This prevents Task A from
awakening prematurely, thus preventing more than one expedited grace
period from being in flight during a previous expedited grace period's
wakeup phase.

KVM: x86: Remove spurious clearing of async #PF MSR
commit 208050dac5ef4de5cb83ffcafa78499c94d0b5ad upstream.
Remove a bogus clearing of apf.msr\_val from kvm\_arch\_vcpu\_destroy().
apf.msr\_val is only set to a non-zero value by kvm\_pv\_enable\_async\_pf(),
which is only reachable by kvm\_set\_msr\_common(), i.e. by writing
MSR\_KVM\_ASYNC\_PF\_EN. KVM does not autonomously write said MSR, i.e.
can only be written via KVM\_SET\_MSRS or KVM\_RUN. Since KVM\_SET\_MSRS and
KVM\_RUN are vcpu ioctls, they require a valid vcpu file descriptor.
kvm\_arch\_vcpu\_destroy() is only called if KVM\_CREATE\_VCPU fails, and KVM
declares KVM\_CREATE\_VCPU successful once the vcpu fd is installed and
thus visible to userspace. Ergo, apf.msr\_val cannot be non-zero when
kvm\_arch\_vcpu\_destroy() is called.

x86 does not load its MMU until KVM\_RUN, which cannot be invoked until
after vCPU creation succeeds. Given that kvm\_arch\_vcpu\_destroy() is

Note, the bogus kvm\_mmu\_unload() call was added during an unrelated

x86/resctrl: Check monitoring static key in the MBM overflow handler
commit 536a0d8e79fb928f2735db37dda95682b6754f9a upstream.
Currently, there are three static keys in the resctrl file system:
rdt\_mon\_enable\_key and rdt\_alloc\_enable\_key indicate if the monitoring
feature and the allocation feature are enabled, respectively. The
rdt\_enable\_key is enabled when either the monitoring feature or the
allocation feature is enabled.
If no monitoring feature is present (either hardware doesn't support a
monitoring feature or the feature is disabled by the kernel command line
option "rdt="), rdt\_enable\_key is still enabled but rdt\_mon\_enable\_key
is disabled.
MBM is a monitoring feature. The MBM overflow handler intends to
check if the monitoring feature is not enabled for fast return.
So check the rdt\_mon\_enable\_key in it instead of the rdt\_enable\_key as
former is the more accurate check.

The low resolution parts of the VDSO, i.e.:
clock\_gettime(CLOCK\_\*\_COARSE), clock\_getres(), time()
can be used even if there is no VDSO capable clocksource.
But if an architecture opts out of the VDSO data update then this
information becomes stale. This affects ARM when there is no architected
timer available. The lack of update causes userspace to use stale data
forever.
Make the update of the low resolution parts unconditional and only skip
the update of the high resolution parts if the architecture requests it.

kprobes: Set unoptimized flag after unoptimizing code
commit f66c0447cca1281116224d474cdb37d6a18e4b5b upstream.
Set the unoptimized flag after confirming the code is completely
unoptimized. Without this fix, when a kprobe hits the intermediate
modified instruction (the first byte is replaced by an INT3, but
later bytes can still be a jump address operand) while unoptimizing,
it can return to the middle byte of the modified code, which causes
an invalid instruction exception in the kernel.
Usually, this is a rare case, but if we put a probe on the function
call while text patching, it always causes a kernel panic as below:
# echo p text\_poke+5 > kprobe\_events
# echo 1 > events/kprobes/enable
# echo 0 > events/kprobes/enable
invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI

text\_poke() is used for patching the code in optprobes.
This can happen even if we blacklist text\_poke() and other functions,
because there is a small time window during which we show the intermediate
code to other CPUs.

Keep the ima policy rules around from the beginning even if they appear

policy rules to a custom IMA policy.

some prints a bit more human readable.

f2fs: fix to add swap extent correctly
commit 3e5e479a39ce9ed60cd63f7565cc1d9da77c2a4e upstream.
As Youling reported in mailing list:
https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/the-file-system-f2fs-is-broken-4175666043/
https://www.linux.org/threads/the-file-system-f2fs-is-broken.26490/
There is a test case can corrupt f2fs image:
- dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=4096
- chmod 600 /swapfile
- mkswap /swapfile
- swapon --discard /swapfile
The root cause is f2fs\_swap\_activate() intends to return zero value
to setup\_swap\_extents() to enable SWP\_FS mode (swap file goes through
fs), in this flow, setup\_swap\_extents() setups swap extent with wrong
block address range, result in discard\_swap() erasing incorrect address.
Because f2fs\_swap\_activate() has pinned swapfile, its data block
address will not change, it's safe to let swap to handle IO through
raw device, so we can get rid of SWAP\_FS mode and initial swap extents
inside f2fs\_swap\_activate(), by this way, later discard\_swap() can trim
in right address range.

But it consume some CPUs out of 'nr' that are not allowed

always return nr\_cpumask\_bits, and we can't find a CPU
which our task is allowed to run.
Cpumask may be too big, similar to select\_idle\_core(), use

KVM: Check for a bad hva before dropping into the ghc slow path
commit fcfbc617547fc6d9552cb6c1c563b6a90ee98085 upstream.
When reading/writing using the guest/host cache, check for a bad hva
before checking for a NULL memslot, which triggers the slow path for
handing cross-page accesses. Because the memslot is nullified on error
by \_\_kvm\_gfn\_to\_hva\_cache\_init(), if the bad hva is encountered after
crossing into a new page, then the kvm\_{read,write}\_guest() slow path
could potentially write/access the first chunk prior to detecting the
bad hva.
Arguably, performing a partial access is semantically correct from an
architectural perspective, but that behavior is certainly not intended.
In the original implementation, memslot was not explicitly nullified
and therefore the partial access behavior varied based on whether the
memslot itself was null, or if the hva was simply bad. The current
behavior was introduced as a seemingly unintentional side effect in
commit f1b9dd5eb86c ("kvm: Disallow wraparound in
kvm\_gfn\_to\_hva\_cache\_init"), which justified the change with "since some
callers don't check the return code from this function, it sit seems
prudent to clear ghc->memslot in the event of an error".
Regardless of intent, the partial access is dependent on \_not\_ checking
the result of the cache initialization, which is arguably a bug in its
own right, at best simply weird.

KVM: SVM: Override default MMIO mask if memory encryption is enabled
commit 52918ed5fcf05d97d257f4131e19479da18f5d16 upstream.
The KVM MMIO support uses bit 51 as the reserved bit to cause nested page
faults when a guest performs MMIO. The AMD memory encryption support uses
a CPUID function to define the encryption bit position. Given this, it is
possible that these bits can conflict.
Use svm\_hardware\_setup() to override the MMIO mask if memory encryption
support is enabled. Various checks are performed to ensure that the mask
is properly defined and rsvd\_bits() is used to generate the new mask (as
was done prior to the change that necessitated this patch).

Commit 800d3f561659 ("perf report: Add warning when libunwind not
compiled in") breaks the s390 platform. S390 uses libdw-dwarf-unwind for
call chain unwinding and had no support for libunwind.
So the warning "Please install libunwind development packages during the
perf build." caused the confusion even if the call-graph is displayed
correctly.
This patch adds checking for HAVE\_DWARF\_SUPPORT, which is set when
libdw-dwarf-unwind is compiled in.

mwifiex: drop most magic numbers from mwifiex\_process\_tdls\_action\_frame()
commit 70e5b8f445fd27fde0c5583460e82539a7242424 upstream.
Before commit 1e58252e334d ("mwifiex: Fix heap overflow in
mmwifiex\_process\_tdls\_action\_frame()"),
mwifiex\_process\_tdls\_action\_frame() already had too many magic numbers.
But this commit just added a ton more, in the name of checking for
buffer overflows. That seems like a really bad idea.
Let's make these magic numbers a little less magic, by
(a) factoring out 'pos[1]' as 'ie\_len'
(b) using 'sizeof' on the appropriate source or destination fields where
possible, instead of bare numbers
(c) dropping redundant checks, per below.
Regarding redundant checks: the beginning of the loop has this:
if (pos + 2 + pos[1] > end)
break;
but then individual 'case's include stuff like this:
if (pos > end - 3)
return;
if (pos[1] != 1)
return;
Note that the second 'return' (validating the length, pos[1]) combined
with the above condition (ensuring 'pos + 2 + length' doesn't exceed
'end'), makes the first 'return' (whose 'if' can be reworded as 'pos >
end - pos[1] - 2') redundant. Rather than unwind the magic numbers
there, just drop those conditions.

namei: only return -ECHILD from follow\_dotdot\_rcu()
commit 2b98149c2377bff12be5dd3ce02ae0506e2dd613 upstream.
It's over-zealous to return hard errors under RCU-walk here, given that
a REF-walk will be triggered for all other cases handling ".." under
RCU.
The original purpose of this check was to ensure that if a rename occurs
such that a directory is moved outside of the bind-mount which the
resolution started in, it would be detected and blocked to avoid being
able to mess with paths outside of the bind-mount. However, triggering a
new REF-walk is just as effective a solution.

tipc: fix successful connect() but timed out
commit 5391a87751a164b3194864126f3b016038abc9fe upstream.
In commit 9546a0b7ce00 ("tipc: fix wrong connect() return code"), we
fixed the issue with the 'connect()' that returns zero even though the
connecting has failed by waiting for the connection to be 'ESTABLISHED'
really. However, the approach has one drawback in conjunction with our
'lightweight' connection setup mechanism that the following scenario
can happen:
(server) (client)
+- accept()| | wait\_for\_conn()
| | |connect() -------+
| |<-------[SYN]---------| > sleeping
| | \*CONNECTING |
|--------->\*ESTABLISHED | |
|--------[ACK]-------->\*ESTABLISHED > wakeup()
send()|--------[DATA]------->|\ > wakeup()
send()|--------[DATA]------->| | > wakeup()
. . . . |-> recvq .
. . . . | .
send()|--------[DATA]------->|/ > wakeup()
close()|--------[FIN]-------->\*DISCONNECTING |
\*DISCONNECTING | |
| ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~> schedule()
| wait again
.
.
| ETIMEDOUT
Upon the receipt of the server 'ACK', the client becomes 'ESTABLISHED'
and the 'wait\_for\_conn()' process is woken up but not run. Meanwhile,
the server starts to send a number of data following by a 'close()'
shortly without waiting any response from the client, which then forces
the client socket to be 'DISCONNECTING' immediately. When the wait
process is switched to be running, it continues to wait until the timer
expires because of the unexpected socket state. The client 'connect()'
will finally get ‘-ETIMEDOUT’ and force to release the socket whereas
there remains the messages in its receive queue.
Obviously the issue would not happen if the server had some delay prior
to its 'close()' (or the number of 'DATA' messages is large enough),
but any kind of delay would make the connection setup/shutdown "heavy".
We solve this by simply allowing the 'connect()' returns zero in this
particular case. The socket is already 'DISCONNECTING', so any further
write will get '-EPIPE' but the socket is still able to read the
messages existing in its receive queue.
Note: This solution doesn't break the previous one as it deals with a
different situation that the socket state is 'DISCONNECTING' but has no
error (i.e. sk->sk\_err = 0).

selftests: Install settings files to fix TIMEOUT failures
commit b9167c8078c3527de6da241c8a1a75a9224ed90a upstream.
Commit 852c8cbf34d3 ("selftests/kselftest/runner.sh: Add 45 second
timeout per test") added a 45 second timeout for tests, and also added
a way for tests to customise the timeout via a settings file.
For example the ftrace tests take multiple minutes to run, so they
were given longer in commit b43e78f65b1d ("tracing/selftests: Turn off
timeout setting").
This works when the tests are run from the source tree. However if the
tests are installed with "make -C tools/testing/selftests install",
the settings files are not copied into the install directory. When the
tests are then run from the install directory the longer timeouts are
not applied and the tests timeout incorrectly.
So add the settings files to TEST\_FILES of the appropriate Makefiles
to cause the settings files to be installed using the existing install
logic.

net: atlantic: checksum compat issue
commit 15beab0a9d797be1b7c67458da007a62269be29a upstream.
Yet another checksum offload compatibility issue was found.
The known issue is that AQC HW marks tcp packets with 0xFFFF checksum
as invalid (1). This is workarounded in driver, passing all the suspicious
packets up to the stack for further csum validation.
Another HW problem (2) is that it hides invalid csum of LRO aggregated
packets inside of the individual descriptors. That was workarounded
by forced scan of all LRO descriptors for checksum errors.
However the scan logic was joint for both LRO and multi-descriptor
packets (jumbos). And this causes the issue.
We have to drop LRO packets with the detected bad checksum
because of (2), but we have to pass jumbo packets to stack because of (1).
When using windows tcp partner with jumbo frames but with LSO disabled
driver discards such frames as bad checksummed. But only LRO frames
should be dropped, not jumbos.
On such a configurations tcp stream have a chance of drops and stucks.

net: netlink: cap max groups which will be considered in netlink\_bind()
commit 3a20773beeeeadec41477a5ba872175b778ff752 upstream.
Since nl\_groups is a u32 we can't bind more groups via ->bind
(netlink\_bind) call, but netlink has supported more groups via
setsockopt() for a long time and thus nlk->ngroups could be over 32.
Recently I added support for per-vlan notifications and increased the
groups to 33 for NETLINK\_ROUTE which exposed an old bug in the
netlink\_bind() code causing out-of-bounds access on archs where unsigned
long is 32 bits via test\_bit() on a local variable. Fix this by capping the
maximum groups in netlink\_bind() to BITS\_PER\_TYPE(u32), effectively
capping them at 32 which is the minimum of allocated groups and the
maximum groups which can be bound via netlink\_bind().

EBUSY is used because vnicc feature and bridgeport feature are mutually

Whereas EOPNOTSUPP indicates that the HW does not support all or parts of

This issue causes the vnicc sysfs params to show 'blocked by bridgeport'

hv\_netvsc: Fix unwanted wakeup in netvsc\_attach()
commit f6f13c125e05603f68f5bf31f045b95e6d493598 upstream.
When netvsc\_attach() is called by operations like changing MTU, etc.,
an extra wakeup may happen while netvsc\_attach() calling
rndis\_filter\_device\_add() which sends rndis messages when queue is
stopped in netvsc\_detach(). The completion message will wake up queue 0.
We can reproduce the issue by changing MTU etc., then the wake\_queue
counter from "ethtool -S" will increase beyond stop\_queue counter:
stop\_queue: 0
wake\_queue: 1
The issue causes queue wake up, and counter increment, no other ill
effects in current code. So we didn't see any network problem for now.
To fix this, initialize tx\_disable to true, and set it to false when
the NIC is ready to be attached or registered.

drm/i915/gvt: Separate display reset from ALL\_ENGINES reset
commit 3eb55e6f753a379e293395de8d5f3be28351a7f8 upstream.
ALL\_ENGINES reset doesn't clobber display with the current gvt-g
supported platforms. Thus ALL\_ENGINES reset shouldn't reset the
display engine registers emulated by gvt-g.
This fixes guest warning like

MIPS: cavium\_octeon: Fix syncw generation.
commit 97e914b7de3c943011779b979b8093fdc0d85722 upstream.
The Cavium Octeon CPU uses a special sync instruction for implementing
wmb, and due to a CPU bug, the instruction must appear twice. A macro
had been defined to hide this:
#define \_\_SYNC\_rpt(type) (1 + (type == \_\_SYNC\_wmb))
which was intended to evaluate to 2 for \_\_SYNC\_wmb, and 1 for any other
type of sync. However, this expression is evaluated by the assembler,
and not the compiler, and the result of '==' in the assembler is 0 or
-1, not 0 or 1 as it is in C. The net result was wmb() producing no code
at all. The simple fix in this patch is to change the '+' to '-'.

commit bef8e2dfceed6daeb6ca3e8d33f9c9d43b926580 upstream.
Pointer on the memory allocated by 'alloc\_progmem()' is stored in
'v->load\_addr'. So this is this memory that should be freed by
'release\_progmem()'.
'release\_progmem()' is only a call to 'kfree()'.
With the current code, there is both a double free and a memory leak.
Fix it by passing the correct pointer to 'release\_progmem()'.

RISC-V: Don't enable all interrupts in trap\_init()
commit 6a1ce99dc4bde564e4a072936f9d41f4a439140e upstream.
Historically, we have been enabling all interrupts for each
HART in trap\_init(). Ideally, we should only enable M-mode
interrupts for M-mode kernel and S-mode interrupts for S-mode
kernel in trap\_init().
Currently, we get suprious S-mode interrupts on Kendryte K210
board running M-mode NO-MMU kernel because we are enabling all
interrupts in trap\_init(). To fix this, we only enable software
and external interrupt in trap\_init(). In future, trap\_init()
will only enable software interrupt and PLIC driver will enable
external interrupt using CPU notifiers.

HID: hiddev: Fix race in in hiddev\_disconnect()
commit 5c02c447eaeda29d3da121a2e17b97ccaf579b51 upstream.
Syzbot reports that "hiddev" is used after it's free in hiddev\_disconnect().
The hiddev\_disconnect() function sets "hiddev->exist = 0;" so
hiddev\_release() can free it as soon as we drop the "existancelock"
lock. This patch moves the mutex\_unlock(&hiddev->existancelock) until
after we have finished using it.

It is unnecessary to hold hashlimit\_mutex for htable\_destroy()

refcount is already zero.
Also, switch hinfo->use to refcount\_t so that we don't have

Also, since there is no guarantee that getname use sockaddr\_ll
parameter beyond its size, we add a little bit of security here.
It should do not do beyond MAX\_ADDR\_LEN, but syzbot found that
ax25\_getname writes more (72 bytes, the size of full\_sockaddr\_ax25,
versus 20 + 32 bytes of sockaddr\_ll + MAX\_ADDR\_LEN in syzbot repro).

net/smc: transfer fasync\_list in case of fallback
commit 67f562e3e147750a02b2a91d21a163fc44a1d13e upstream.
SMC does not work together with FASTOPEN. If sendmsg() is called with
flag MSG\_FASTOPEN in SMC\_INIT state, the SMC-socket switches to
fallback mode. To handle the previous ioctl FIOASYNC call correctly
in this case, it is necessary to transfer the socket wait queue
fasync\_list to the internal TCP socket.

netfilter: ipset: Fix "INFO: rcu detected stall in hash\_xxx" reports
commit f66ee0410b1c3481ee75e5db9b34547b4d582465 upstream.
In the case of huge hash:\* types of sets, due to the single spinlock of
a set the processing of the whole set under spinlock protection could take
too long.
There were four places where the whole hash table of the set was processed
from bucket to bucket under holding the spinlock:
- During resizing a set, the original set was locked to exclude kernel side
add/del element operations (userspace add/del is excluded by the
nfnetlink mutex). The original set is actually just read during the
resize, so the spinlocking is replaced with rcu locking of regions.
However, thus there can be parallel kernel side add/del of entries.
In order not to loose those operations a backlog is added and replayed
after the successful resize.
- Garbage collection of timed out entries was also protected by the spinlock.
In order not to lock too long, region locking is introduced and a single
region is processed in one gc go. Also, the simple timer based gc running
is replaced with a workqueue based solution. The internal book-keeping
(number of elements, size of extensions) is moved to region level due to
the region locking.
- Adding elements: when the max number of the elements is reached, the gc
was called to evict the timed out entries. The new approach is that the gc
is called just for the matching region, assuming that if the region
(proportionally) seems to be full, then the whole set does. We could scan
the other regions to check every entry under rcu locking, but for huge
sets it'd mean a slowdown at adding elements.
- Listing the set header data: when the set was defined with timeout
support, the garbage collector was called to clean up timed out entries
to get the correct element numbers and set size values. Now the set is
scanned to check non-timed out entries, without actually calling the gc
for the whole set.
Thanks to Florian Westphal for helping me to solve the SOFTIRQ-safe ->
SOFTIRQ-unsafe lock order issues during working on the patch.

Before commit 1e4f63aecb53 ("cpufreq: Avoid creating excessively

cpufreq\_policy set by the driver's ->init() callback was implicitly
passed from cpufreq\_init\_policy() to cpufreq\_set\_policy() if the
default governor was neither "performance" nor "powersave". After
that commit, however, cpufreq\_init\_policy() must take that case into
consideration explicitly and handle it as appropriate, so make that
happen.

The name changing as devfreq(X) breaks some user space applications,
such as Android HAL from Unisoc and Hikey [1].
The device name will be changed unexpectly after every boot depending
on module init sequence. It will make trouble to setup some system

So we'd like to revert it back to old naming rule before any better

tracing: Disable trace\_printk() on post poned tests
commit 78041c0c9e935d9ce4086feeff6c569ed88ddfd4 upstream.
The tracing seftests checks various aspects of the tracing infrastructure,
and one is filtering. If trace\_printk() is active during a self test, it can
cause the filtering to fail, which will disable that part of the trace.
To keep the selftests from failing because of trace\_printk() calls,
trace\_printk() checks the variable tracing\_selftest\_running, and if set, it
does not write to the tracing buffer.
As some tracers were registered earlier in boot, the selftest they triggered
would fail because not all the infrastructure was set up for the full
selftest. Thus, some of the tests were post poned to when their
infrastructure was ready (namely file system code). The postpone code did
not set the tracing\_seftest\_running variable, and could fail if a
trace\_printk() was added and executed during their run.

blktrace: Protect q->blk\_trace with RCU
commit c780e86dd48ef6467a1146cf7d0fe1e05a635039 upstream.
KASAN is reporting that \_\_blk\_add\_trace() has a use-after-free issue
when accessing q->blk\_trace. Indeed the switching of block tracing (and
thus eventual freeing of q->blk\_trace) is completely unsynchronized with
the currently running tracing and thus it can happen that the blk\_trace
structure is being freed just while \_\_blk\_add\_trace() works on it.
Protect accesses to q->blk\_trace by RCU during tracing and make sure we
wait for the end of RCU grace period when shutting down tracing. Luckily
that is rare enough event that we can afford that. Note that postponing
the freeing of blk\_trace to an RCU callback should better be avoided as
it could have unexpected user visible side-effects as debugfs files
would be still existing for a short while block tracing has been shut
down.

macintosh: therm\_windtunnel: fix regression when instantiating devices
commit 38b17afb0ebb9ecd41418d3c08bcf9198af4349d upstream.
Removing attach\_adapter from this driver caused a regression for at
least some machines. Those machines had the sensors described in their
DT, too, so they didn't need manual creation of the sensor devices. The
old code worked, though, because manual creation came first. Creation of
DT devices then failed later and caused error logs, but the sensors
worked nonetheless because of the manually created devices.
When removing attach\_adaper, manual creation now comes later and loses
the race. The sensor devices were already registered via DT, yet with
another binding, so the driver could not be bound to it.
This fix refactors the code to remove the race and only manually creates
devices if there are no DT nodes present. Also, the DT binding is updated
to match both, the DT and manually created devices. Because we don't
know which device creation will be used at runtime, the code to start
the kthread is moved to do\_probe() which will be called by both methods.

drm/radeon: Inline drm\_get\_pci\_dev
commit eb12c957735b582607e5842a06d1f4c62e185c1d upstream.
It's the last user, and more importantly, it's the last non-legacy
user of anything in drm\_pci.c.
The only tricky bit is the agp initialization. But a close look shows
that radeon does not use the drm\_agp midlayer (the main use of that is
drm\_bufs for legacy drivers), and instead could use the agp subsystem
directly (like nouveau does already). Hence we can just pull this in
too.
A further step would be to entirely drop the use of drm\_device->agp,
but feels like too much churn just for this patch.

HID: ite: Only bind to keyboard USB interface on Acer SW5-012 keyboard dock
commit beae56192a2570578ae45050e73c5ff9254f63e6 upstream.
Commit 8f18eca9ebc5 ("HID: ite: Add USB id match for Acer SW5-012 keyboard
dock") added the USB id for the Acer SW5-012's keyboard dock to the
hid-ite driver to fix the rfkill driver not working.
Most keyboard docks with an ITE 8595 keyboard/touchpad controller have the
"Wireless Radio Control" bits which need the special hid-ite driver on the
second USB interface (the mouse interface) and their touchpad only supports
mouse emulation, so using generic hid-input handling for anything but
the "Wireless Radio Control" bits is fine. On these devices we simply bind
to all USB interfaces.
But unlike other ITE8595 using keyboard docks, the Acer Aspire Switch 10
(SW5-012)'s touchpad not only does mouse emulation it also supports
HID-multitouch and all the keys including the "Wireless Radio Control"
bits have been moved to the first USB interface (the keyboard intf).
So we need hid-ite to handle the first (keyboard) USB interface and have
it NOT bind to the second (mouse) USB interface so that that can be
handled by hid-multitouch.c and we get proper multi-touch support.
This commit changes the hid\_device\_id for the SW5-012 keyboard dock to
only match on hid devices from the HID\_GROUP\_GENERIC group, this way
hid-ite will not bind the the mouse/multi-touch interface which has
HID\_GROUP\_MULTITOUCH\_WIN\_8 as group.
This fixes the regression to mouse-emulation mode introduced by adding
the keyboard dock USB id.

audit: fix error handling in audit\_data\_to\_entry()
commit 2ad3e17ebf94b7b7f3f64c050ff168f9915345eb upstream.
Commit 219ca39427bf ("audit: use union for audit\_field values since
they are mutually exclusive") combined a number of separate fields in
the audit\_field struct into a single union. Generally this worked
just fine because they are generally mutually exclusive.
Unfortunately in audit\_data\_to\_entry() the overlap can be a problem
when a specific error case is triggered that causes the error path
code to attempt to cleanup an audit\_field struct and the cleanup
involves attempting to free a stored LSM string (the lsm\_str field).
Currently the code always has a non-NULL value in the
audit\_field.lsm\_str field as the top of the for-loop transfers a
value into audit\_field.val (both .lsm\_str and .val are part of the
same union); if audit\_data\_to\_entry() fails and the audit\_field
struct is specified to contain a LSM string, but the
audit\_field.lsm\_str has not yet been properly set, the error handling
code will attempt to free the bogus audit\_field.lsm\_str value that
was set with audit\_field.val at the top of the for-loop.
This patch corrects this by ensuring that the audit\_field.val is only
set when needed (it is cleared when the audit\_field struct is
allocated with kcalloc()). It also corrects a few other issues to
ensure that in case of error the proper error code is returned.

sphinx-build), the argument passed would be empty ("") instead of just
being missing, which would (understandably) badly confuse sphinx-build.
Fix this by removing the quotes.

scsi: zfcp: fix wrong data and display format of SFP+ temperature
commit a3fd4bfe85fbb67cf4ec1232d0af625ece3c508b upstream.
When implementing support for retrieval of local diagnostic data from the
FCP channel, the wrong data format was assumed for the temperature of the
local SFP+ connector. The Fibre Channel Link Services (FC-LS-3)
specification is not clear on the format of the stored integer, and only
after consulting the SNIA specification SFF-8472 did we realize it is
stored as two's complement. Thus, the used data and display format is
wrong, and highly misleading for users when the temperature should drop
below 0°C (however unlikely that may be).
To fix this, change the data format in `struct fsf\_qtcb\_bottom\_port` from
unsigned to signed, and change the printf format string used to generate
`zfcp\_sysfs\_adapter\_diag\_sfp\_temperature\_show()` from `%hu` to `%hd`.

scsi: sd\_sbc: Fix sd\_zbc\_report\_zones()
commit 51fdaa0490241e8cd41b40cbf43a336d1a014460 upstream.
The block layer generic blk\_revalidate\_disk\_zones() checks the validity of
zone descriptors reported by a disk using the blk\_revalidate\_zone\_cb()
callback function executed for each zone descriptor. If a ZBC disk reports
invalid zone descriptors, blk\_revalidate\_disk\_zones() returns an error and
sd\_zbc\_read\_zones() changes the disk capacity to 0, which in turn results
in the gendisk structure capacity to be set to 0. This all works well for
the first revalidate pass on a disk and the block layer detects the
capactiy change.
On the second revalidate pass, blk\_revalidate\_disk\_zones() is called again
and sd\_zbc\_report\_zones() executed to check the zones a second time.
However, for this second pass, the gendisk capacity is now 0, which results
in sd\_zbc\_report\_zones() to do nothing and to report success and no
zones. blk\_revalidate\_disk\_zones() in turn returns success and sets the
disk queue chunk\_sectors limit with zero as no zones were checked, causing
a oops to trigger on the BUG\_ON(!is\_power\_of\_2(chunk\_sectors)) in
blk\_queue\_chunk\_sectors().
Fix this by using the sdkp capacity field rather than the gendisk capacity
for the report zones loop in sd\_zbc\_report\_zones(). Also add a check to
return immediately an error if the sdkp capacity is 0. With this fix,
invalid/buggy ZBC disk scan does not trigger a oops and are exposed with a
0 capacity. This change also preserve the chance for the disk to be
correctly revalidated on the second revalidate pass as the scsi disk
structure capacity field is always set to the disk reported value when
sd\_zbc\_report\_zones() is called.

nvme/pci: move cqe check after device shutdown
[ Upstream commit fa46c6fb5d61b1f17b06d7c6ef75478b576304c7 ]
Many users have reported nvme triggered irq\_startup() warnings during
shutdown. The driver uses the nvme queue's irq to synchronize scanning
for completions, and enabling an interrupt affined to only offline CPUs
triggers the alarming warning.
Move the final CQE check to after disabling the device and all
registered interrupts have been torn down so that we do not have any
IRQ to synchronize.

nvme: prevent warning triggered by nvme\_stop\_keep\_alive
[ Upstream commit 97b2512ad000a409b4073dd1a71e4157d76675cb ]
Delayed keep alive work is queued on system workqueue and may be cancelled
via nvme\_stop\_keep\_alive from nvme\_reset\_wq, nvme\_fc\_wq or nvme\_wq.
Check\_flush\_dependency detects mismatched attributes between the work-queue
context used to cancel the keep alive work and system-wq. Specifically
system-wq does not have the WQ\_MEM\_RECLAIM flag, whereas the contexts used
to cancel keep alive work have WQ\_MEM\_RECLAIM flag.
Example warning:
workqueue: WQ\_MEM\_RECLAIM nvme-reset-wq:nvme\_fc\_reset\_ctrl\_work [nvme\_fc]
is flushing !WQ\_MEM\_RECLAIM events:nvme\_keep\_alive\_work [nvme\_core]
To avoid the flags mismatch, delayed keep alive work is queued on nvme\_wq.
However this creates a secondary concern where work and a request to cancel
that work may be in the same work queue - namely err\_work in the rdma and
tcp transports, which will want to flush/cancel the keep alive work which
will now be on nvme\_wq.
After reviewing the transports, it looks like err\_work can be moved to
nvme\_reset\_wq. In fact that aligns them better with transition into
RESETTING and performing related reset work in nvme\_reset\_wq.
Change nvme-rdma and nvme-tcp to perform err\_work in nvme\_reset\_wq.

nvme/tcp: fix bug on double requeue when send fails
[ Upstream commit 2d570a7c0251c594489a2c16b82b14ae30345c03 ]
When nvme\_tcp\_io\_work() fails to send to socket due to
connection close/reset, error\_recovery work is triggered
from nvme\_tcp\_state\_change() socket callback.
This cancels all the active requests in the tagset,
which requeues them.
The failed request, however, was ended and thus requeued
individually as well unless send returned -EPIPE.
Another return code to be treated the same way is -ECONNRESET.
Double requeue caused BUG\_ON(blk\_queued\_rq(rq))
in blk\_mq\_requeue\_request() from either the individual requeue
of the failed request or the bulk requeue from
blk\_mq\_tagset\_busy\_iter(, nvme\_cancel\_request, );

net: ena: fix incorrectly saving queue numbers when setting RSS indirection table
[ Upstream commit 92569fd27f5cb0ccbdf7c7d70044b690e89a0277 ]
The indirection table has the indices of the Rx queues. When we store it
during set indirection operation, we convert the indices to our internal
representation of the indices.
Our internal representation of the indices is: even indices for Tx and
uneven indices for Rx, where every Tx/Rx pair are in a consecutive order
starting from 0. For example if the driver has 3 queues (3 for Tx and 3
for Rx) then the indices are as follows:
0 1 2 3 4 5
Tx Rx Tx Rx Tx Rx
The BUG:
The issue is that when we satisfy a get request for the indirection
table, we don't convert the indices back to the original representation.
The FIX:
Simply apply the inverse function for the indices of the indirection
table after we set it.

net: ena: rss: store hash function as values and not bits
[ Upstream commit 4844470d472d660c26149ad764da2406adb13423 ]
The device receives, stores and retrieves the hash function value as bits
and not as their enum value.
The bug:
\* In ena\_com\_set\_hash\_function() we set
cmd.u.flow\_hash\_func.selected\_func to the bit value of rss->hash\_func.
(1 << rss->hash\_func)
\* In ena\_com\_get\_hash\_function() we retrieve the hash function and store
it's bit value in rss->hash\_func. (Now the bit value of rss->hash\_func
is stored in rss->hash\_func instead of it's enum value)
The fix:
This commit fixes the issue by converting the retrieved hash function
values from the device to the matching enum value of the set bit using
ffs(). ffs() finds the first set bit's index in a word. Since the function
returns 1 for the LSB's index, we need to subtract 1 from the returned
value (note that BIT(0) is 1).

net: ena: fix incorrect default RSS key

Bug description:
When running "ethtool -x " the key shows up as all zeros.
When we use "ethtool -X  hfunc toeplitz hkey " to
set the key and then try to retrieve it using "ethtool -x " then
we return the correct key because we return the one we saved.
Bug cause:
We don't fetch the key from the device but instead return the key
that we have saved internally which is by default set to zero upon
allocation.
Fix:
This commit fixes the issue by initializing the key to a random value
using netdev\_rss\_key\_fill().

net: ena: add missing ethtool TX timestamping indication
[ Upstream commit cf6d17fde93bdda23c9b02dd5906a12bf8c55209 ]
Current implementation of the driver calls skb\_tx\_timestamp()to add a
software tx timestamp to the skb, however the software-transmit capability
is not reported in ethtool -T.
This commit updates the ethtool structure to report the software-transmit
capability in ethtool -T using the standard ethtool\_op\_get\_ts\_info().
This function reports all software timestamping capabilities (tx and rx),
as well as setting phc\_index = -1. phc\_index is the index of the PTP
hardware clock device that will be used for hardware timestamps. Since we
don't have such a device in ENA, using the default -1 value is the correct
setting.

net: ena: fix uses of round\_jiffies()
[ Upstream commit 2a6e5fa2f4c25b66c763428a3e65363214946931 ]
>From the documentation of round\_jiffies():
"Rounds a time delta in the future (in jiffies) up or down to
(approximately) full seconds. This is useful for timers for which
the exact time they fire does not matter too much, as long as
they fire approximately every X seconds.
By rounding these timers to whole seconds, all such timers will fire
at the same time, rather than at various times spread out. The goal
of this is to have the CPU wake up less, which saves power."
There are 2 parts to this patch:
================================
Part 1:
-------
In our case we need timer\_service to be called approximately every
X=1 seconds, and the exact time does not matter, so using round\_jiffies()
is the right way to go.
Therefore we add round\_jiffies() to the mod\_timer() in ena\_timer\_service().
Part 2:
-------
round\_jiffies() is used in check\_for\_missing\_keep\_alive() when
getting the jiffies of the expiration of the keep\_alive timeout. Here it
is actually a mistake to use round\_jiffies() because we want the exact
time when keep\_alive should expire and not an approximate rounded time,
which can cause early, false positive, timeouts.
Therefore we remove round\_jiffies() in the calculation of
keep\_alive\_expired() in check\_for\_missing\_keep\_alive().

amdgpu: Prevent build errors regarding soft/hard-float FP ABI tags
[ Upstream commit 416611d9b6eebaeae58ed26cc7d23131c69126b1 ]
On PowerPC, the compiler will tag object files with whether they
use hard or soft float FP ABI and whether they use 64 or 128-bit
long double ABI. On systems with 64-bit long double ABI, a tag
will get emitted whenever a double is used, as on those systems
a long double is the same as a double. This will prevent linkage
as other files are being compiled with hard-float.
On ppc64, this code will never actually get used for the time
being, as the only currently existing hardware using it are the
Renoir APUs. Therefore, until this is testable and can be fixed
properly, at least make sure the build will not fail.

qmi\_wwan: unconditionally reject 2 ep interfaces
[ Upstream commit 00516d13d4cfa56ce39da144db2dbf08b09b9357 ]
We have been using the fact that the QMI and DIAG functions
usually are the only ones with class/subclass/protocol being
ff/ff/ff on Quectel modems. This has allowed us to match the
QMI function without knowing the exact interface number,
which can vary depending on firmware configuration.
The ability to silently reject the DIAG function, which is
usually handled by the option driver, is important for this
method to work. This is done based on the knowledge that it
has exactly 2 bulk endpoints. QMI function control interfaces
will have either 3 or 1 endpoint. This rule is universal so
the quirk condition can be removed.
The fixed layouts known from the Gobi1k and Gobi2k modems
have been gradually replaced by more dynamic layouts, and
many vendors now use configurable layouts without changing
device IDs. Renaming the class/subclass/protocol matching
macro makes it more obvious that this is now not Quectel
specific anymore.

qmi\_wwan: re-add DW5821e pre-production variant
[ Upstream commit 88bf54603f6f2c137dfee1abf6436ceac3528d2d ]
Commit f25e1392fdb5 removed the support for the pre-production variant
of the Dell DW5821e to avoid probing another USB interface unnecessarily.
However, the pre-production samples are found in the wild, and this lack
of support is causing problems for users of such samples. It is therefore
necessary to support both variants.
Matching on both interfaces 0 and 1 is not expected to cause any problem
with either variant, as only the QMI function will be probed successfully
on either. Interface 1 will be rejected based on the HID class for the
production variant:

s390/zcrypt: fix card and queue total counter wrap
[ Upstream commit fcd98d4002539f1e381916fc1b6648938c1eac76 ]
The internal statistic counters for the total number of
requests processed per card and per queue used integers. So they do
wrap after a rather huge amount of crypto requests processed. This
patch introduces uint64 counters which should hold much longer but
still may wrap. The sysfs attributes request\_count for card and queue
also used only %ld and now display the counter value with %llu.
This is not a security relevant fix. The int overflow which happened
is not in any way exploitable as a security breach.

mac80211: consider more elements in parsing CRC
[ Upstream commit a04564c99bb4a92f805a58e56b2d22cc4978f152 ]
We only use the parsing CRC for checking if a beacon changed,
and elements with an ID > 63 cannot be represented in the
filter. Thus, like we did before with WMM and Cisco vendor
elements, just statically add these forgotten items to the
CRC:
- WLAN\_EID\_VHT\_OPERATION
- WLAN\_EID\_OPMODE\_NOTIF
I guess that in most cases when VHT/HE operation change, the HT
operation also changed, and so the change was picked up, but we
did notice that pure operating mode notification changes were
ignored.

fstests generic/471 reports a failure when run with MOUNT\_OPTIONS="-o

sched/fair: Prevent unlimited runtime on throttled group
[ Upstream commit 2a4b03ffc69f2dedc6388e9a6438b5f4c133a40d ]
When a running task is moved on a throttled task group and there is no
other task enqueued on the CPU, the task can keep running using 100% CPU
whatever the allocated bandwidth for the group and although its cfs rq is
throttled. Furthermore, the group entity of the cfs\_rq and its parents are
not enqueued but only set as curr on their respective cfs\_rqs.
We have the following sequence:
sched\_move\_task
-dequeue\_task: dequeue task and group\_entities.
-put\_prev\_task: put task and group entities.
-sched\_change\_group: move task to new group.
-enqueue\_task: enqueue only task but not group entities because cfs\_rq is
throttled.
-set\_next\_task : set task and group\_entities as current sched\_entity of
their cfs\_rq.
Another impact is that the root cfs\_rq runnable\_load\_avg at root rq stays
null because the group\_entities are not enqueued. This situation will stay
the same until an "external" event triggers a reschedule. Let trigger it
immediately instead.

The way loadavg is tracked during nohz only pays attention to the load
upon entering nohz. This can be particularly noticeable if full nohz is
entered while non-idle, and then the cpu goes idle and stays that way for
a long time.
Use the remote tick to ensure that full nohz cpus report their deltas

The root of the problem is that the default segment size for sgt is
(UINT\_MAX & PAGE\_MASK), and the default segment size for device dma is
64K. As such, if you compare the 2, you would deduce that the sg segment
will overflow the device's capacity. In reality, the hardware can
accommodate the larger sg segments, it's just not initializing its max
segment properly. This patch initializes the max segment size for the
mdss device, which gets rid of that pesky warning.

net: macb: Properly handle phylink on at91rm9200
[ Upstream commit ac2fcfa9fd26db67d7000677c05629c34cc94564 ]
at91ether\_init was handling the phy mode and speed but since the switch to
phylink, the NCFGR register got overwritten by macb\_mac\_config(). The issue
is that the RM9200\_RMII bit and the MACB\_CLK\_DIV32 field are cleared
but never restored as they conflict with the PAE, GBE and PCSSEL bits.
Add new capability to differentiate between EMAC and the other versions of
the IP and use it to set and avoid clearing the relevant bits.
Also, this fixes a NULL pointer dereference in macb\_mac\_link\_up as the EMAC
doesn't use any rings/bufffers/queues.

net: add strict checks in netdev\_name\_node\_alt\_destroy()
[ Upstream commit e08ad80551b4b33c02f2fce1522f6c227d3976cf ]
netdev\_name\_node\_alt\_destroy() does a lookup over all
device names of a namespace.
We need to make sure the name belongs to the device
of interest, and that we do not destroy its primary
name, since we rely on it being not deleted :
dev->name\_node would indeed point to freed memory.

ipv6: Fix nlmsg\_flags when splitting a multipath route
[ Upstream commit afecdb376bd81d7e16578f0cfe82a1aec7ae18f3 ]
When splitting an RTA\_MULTIPATH request into multiple routes and adding the
second and later components, we must not simply remove NLM\_F\_REPLACE but
instead replace it by NLM\_F\_CREATE. Otherwise, it may look like the netlink
message was malformed.
For example,
ip route add 2001:db8::1/128 dev dummy0
ip route change 2001:db8::1/128 nexthop via fe80::30:1 dev dummy0 \
nexthop via fe80::30:2 dev dummy0
results in the following warnings:
[ 1035.057019] IPv6: RTM\_NEWROUTE with no NLM\_F\_CREATE or NLM\_F\_REPLACE
[ 1035.057517] IPv6: NLM\_F\_CREATE should be set when creating new route
This patch makes the nlmsg sequence look equivalent for \_\_ip6\_ins\_rt() to
what it would get if the multipath route had been added in multiple netlink
operations:
ip route add 2001:db8::1/128 dev dummy0
ip route change 2001:db8::1/128 nexthop via fe80::30:1 dev dummy0
ip route append 2001:db8::1/128 nexthop via fe80::30:2 dev dummy0

ipv6: Fix route replacement with dev-only route
[ Upstream commit e404b8c7cfb31654c9024d497cec58a501501692 ]
After commit 27596472473a ("ipv6: fix ECMP route replacement") it is no
longer possible to replace an ECMP-able route by a non ECMP-able route.
For example,
ip route add 2001:db8::1/128 via fe80::1 dev dummy0
ip route replace 2001:db8::1/128 dev dummy0
does not work as expected.
Tweak the replacement logic so that point 3 in the log of the above commit
becomes:
3. If the new route is not ECMP-able, and no matching non-ECMP-able route
exists, replace matching ECMP-able route (if any) or add the new route.
We can now summarize the entire replace semantics to:
When doing a replace, prefer replacing a matching route of the same
"ECMP-able-ness" as the replace argument. If there is no such candidate,
fallback to the first route found.

bonding: fix lockdep warning in bond\_get\_stats()
[ Upstream commit b3e80d44f5b1b470dd9e2dbc6816e63a5c519709 ]
In the "struct bonding", there is stats\_lock.
This lock protects "bond\_stats" in the "struct bonding".
bond\_stats is updated in the bond\_get\_stats() and this function would be
executed concurrently. So, the lock is needed.
Bonding interfaces would be nested.
So, either stats\_lock should use dynamic lockdep class key or stats\_lock
should be used by spin\_lock\_nested(). In the current code, stats\_lock is
using a dynamic lockdep class key.
But there is no updating stats\_lock\_key routine So, lockdep warning
will occur.
Test commands:
ip link add bond0 type bond
ip link add bond1 type bond
ip link set bond0 master bond1
ip link set bond0 nomaster
ip link set bond1 master bond0
Splat looks like:

But, there is another problem.
The dynamic lockdep class key is protected by RTNL, but bond\_get\_stats()
would be called outside of RTNL.
So, it would use an invalid dynamic lockdep class key.
In order to fix this issue, stats\_lock uses spin\_lock\_nested() instead of
a dynamic lockdep key.
The bond\_get\_stats() calls bond\_get\_lowest\_level\_rcu() to get the correct
nest level value, which will be used by spin\_lock\_nested().
The "dev->lower\_level" indicates lower nest level value, but this value
is invalid outside of RTNL.
So, bond\_get\_lowest\_level\_rcu() returns valid lower nest level value in
the RCU critical section.
bond\_get\_lowest\_level\_rcu() will be work only when LOCKDEP is enabled.

net: export netdev\_next\_lower\_dev\_rcu()
[ Upstream commit 7151affeef8d527f50b4b68a871fd28bd660023f ]
netdev\_next\_lower\_dev\_rcu() will be used to implement a function,
which is to walk all lower interfaces.
There are already functions that they walk their lower interface.
(netdev\_walk\_all\_lower\_dev\_rcu, netdev\_walk\_all\_lower\_dev()).
But, there would be cases that couldn't be covered by given
netdev\_walk\_all\_lower\_dev\_{rcu}() function.
So, some modules would want to implement own function,
which is to walk all lower interfaces.
In the next patch, netdev\_next\_lower\_dev\_rcu() will be used.
In addition, this patch removes two unused prototypes in netdevice.h.

sctp: move the format error check out of \_\_sctp\_sf\_do\_9\_1\_abort
[ Upstream commit 245709ec8be89af46ea7ef0444c9c80913999d99 ]
When T2 timer is to be stopped, the asoc should also be deleted,
otherwise, there will be no chance to call sctp\_association\_free
and the asoc could last in memory forever.
However, in sctp\_sf\_shutdown\_sent\_abort(), after adding the cmd
SCTP\_CMD\_TIMER\_STOP for T2 timer, it may return error due to the
format error from \_\_sctp\_sf\_do\_9\_1\_abort() and miss adding
SCTP\_CMD\_ASSOC\_FAILED where the asoc will be deleted.
This patch is to fix it by moving the format error check out of
\_\_sctp\_sf\_do\_9\_1\_abort(), and do it before adding the cmd
SCTP\_CMD\_TIMER\_STOP for T2 timer.
Thanks Hangbin for reporting this issue by the fuzz testing.

udp: rehash on disconnect
[ Upstream commit 303d0403b8c25e994e4a6e45389e173cf8706fb5 ]
As of the below commit, udp sockets bound to a specific address can
coexist with one bound to the any addr for the same port.
The commit also phased out the use of socket hashing based only on
port (hslot), in favor of always hashing on {addr, port} (hslot2).
The change broke the following behavior with disconnect (AF\_UNSPEC):
server binds to 0.0.0.0:1337
server connects to 127.0.0.1:80
server disconnects
client connects to 127.0.0.1:1337
client sends "hello"
server reads "hello" // times out, packet did not find sk
On connect the server acquires a specific source addr suitable for
routing to its destination. On disconnect it reverts to the any addr.
The connect call triggers a rehash to a different hslot2. On
disconnect, add the same to return to the original hslot2.
Skip this step if the socket is going to be unhashed completely.

Ahmed reported ouf-of-order issues bisected to commit ba27b4cdaaa6
("net: dev: introduce support for sch BYPASS for lockless qdisc").
I can't find any working solution other than a plain revert.
This will introduce some minor performance regressions for

qede: Fix race between rdma destroy workqueue and link change event
[ Upstream commit af6565adb02d3129d3fae4d9d5da945abaf4417a ]
If an event is added while the rdma workqueue is being destroyed
it could lead to several races, list corruption, null pointer
dereference during queue\_work or init\_queue.
This fixes the race between the two flows which can occur during
shutdown.
A kref object and a completion object are added to the rdma\_dev
structure, these are initialized before the workqueue is created.
The refcnt is used to indicate work is being added to the
workqueue and ensures the cleanup flow won't start while we're in
the middle of adding the event.
Once the work is added, the refcnt is decreased and the cleanup flow
is safe to run.

nfc: pn544: Fix occasional HW initialization failure
[ Upstream commit c3331d2fe3fd4d5e321f2467d01f72de7edfb5d0 ]
The PN544 driver checks the "enable" polarity during of driver's probe and
it's doing that by turning ON and OFF NFC with different polarities until
enabling succeeds. It takes some time for the hardware to power-down, and
thus, to deassert the IRQ that is raised by turning ON the hardware.
Since the delay after last power-down of the polarity-checking process is
missed in the code, the interrupt may trigger immediately after installing
the IRQ handler (right after the checking is done), which results in IRQ
handler trying to touch the disabled HW and ends with marking NFC as
'DEAD' during of the driver's probe:
pn544\_hci\_i2c 1-002a: NFC: nfc\_en polarity : active high
pn544\_hci\_i2c 1-002a: NFC: invalid len byte
shdlc: llc\_shdlc\_recv\_frame: NULL Frame -> link is dead
This patch fixes the occasional NFC initialization failure on Nexus 7
device.

net/tls: Fix to avoid gettig invalid tls record
[ Upstream commit 06f5201c6392f998a49ca9c9173e2930c8eb51d8 ]
Current code doesn't check if tcp sequence number is starting from (/after)
1st record's start sequnce number. It only checks if seq number is before
1st record's end sequnce number. This problem will always be a possibility
in re-transmit case. If a record which belongs to a requested seq number is
already deleted, tls\_get\_record will start looking into list and as per the
check it will look if seq number is before the end seq of 1st record, which
will always be true and will return 1st record always, it should in fact
return NULL.
As part of the fix, start looking each record only if the sequence number
lies in the list else return NULL.
There is one more check added, driver look for the start marker record to
handle tcp packets which are before the tls offload start sequence number,
hence return 1st record if the record is tls start marker and seq number is
before the 1st record's starting sequence number.

net: sched: correct flower port blocking
[ Upstream commit 8a9093c79863b58cc2f9874d7ae788f0d622a596 ]
tc flower rules that are based on src or dst port blocking are sometimes
ineffective due to uninitialized stack data. \_\_skb\_flow\_dissect() extracts
ports from the skb for tc flower to match against. However, the port
dissection is not done when when the FLOW\_DIS\_IS\_FRAGMENT bit is set in
key\_control->flags. All callers of \_\_skb\_flow\_dissect(), zero-out the
key\_control field except for fl\_classify() as used by the flower
classifier. Thus, the FLOW\_DIS\_IS\_FRAGMENT may be set on entry to
\_\_skb\_flow\_dissect(), since key\_control is allocated on the stack
and may not be initialized.
Since key\_basic and key\_control are present for all flow keys, let's
make sure they are initialized.

net: mscc: fix in frame extraction
[ Upstream commit a81541041ceb55bcec9a8bb8ad3482263f0a205a ]
Each extracted frame on Ocelot has an IFH. The frame and IFH are extracted
by reading chuncks of 4 bytes from a register.
In case the IFH and frames were read corretly it would try to read the next
frame. In case there are no more frames in the queue, it checks if there
were any previous errors and in that case clear the queue. But this check
will always succeed also when there are no errors. Because when extracting
the IFH the error is checked against 4(number of bytes read) and then the
error is set only if the extraction of the frame failed. So in a happy case
where there are no errors the err variable is still 4. So it could be
a case where after the check that there are no more frames in the queue, a
frame will arrive in the queue but because the error is not reseted, it
would try to flush the queue. So the frame will be lost.
The fix consist in resetting the error after reading the IFH.

An update that solves 7 vulnerabilities and has 76 fixes is
now available.
Description:
The openSUSE Leap 15.1 kernel was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2020-11669: An issue was discovered on the powerpc platform.
arch/powerpc/kernel/idle\_book3s.S did not have save/restore
functionality for PNV\_POWERSAVE\_AMR, PNV\_POWERSAVE\_UAMOR, and
PNV\_POWERSAVE\_AMOR, aka CID-53a712bae5dd (bnc#1169390).
- CVE-2020-8834: KVM on Power8 processors had a conflicting use of
HSTATE\_HOST\_R1 to store r1 state in kvmppc\_hv\_entry plus in
kvmppc\_{save,restore}\_tm, leading to a stack corruption. Because of
this, an attacker with the ability run code in kernel space of a guest
VM can cause the host kernel to panic. There were two commits that,
according to the reporter, introduced the vulnerability: f024ee098476
("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Pull out TM state save/restore into separate
procedures") 87a11bb6a7f7 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Work around XER[SO] bug
in fake suspend mode") (bnc#1168276).
- CVE-2020-11494: An issue was discovered in slc\_bump in
drivers/net/can/slcan.c, which allowed attackers to read uninitialized
can\_frame data, potentially containing sensitive information from kernel
stack memory, if the configuration lacks CONFIG\_INIT\_STACK\_ALL, aka
CID-b9258a2cece4 (bnc#1168424).
- CVE-2019-9458: In the video driver there is a use after free due to a
race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no
additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed
for exploitation (bnc#1168295).
- CVE-2019-3701: An issue was discovered in can\_can\_gw\_rcv in
net/can/gw.c. The CAN frame modification rules allow bitwise logical
operations that can be also applied to the can\_dlc field. The privileged
user "root" with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN can create a CAN frame modification rule
that made the data length code a higher value than the available CAN
frame data size. In combination with a configured checksum calculation
where the result is stored relatively to the end of the data (e.g.
cgw\_csum\_xor\_rel) the tail of the skb (e.g. frag\_list pointer in
skb\_shared\_info) can be rewritten which finally can cause a system
crash. Because of a missing check, the CAN drivers may write arbitrary
content beyond the data registers in the CAN controller's I/O memory
when processing can-gw manipulated outgoing frames (bnc#1120386).
- CVE-2020-10942: In get\_raw\_socket in drivers/vhost/net.c lacked
validation of an sk\_family field, which might allow attackers to trigger
kernel stack corruption via crafted system calls (bnc#1167629).
- CVE-2019-19770: A use-after-free in the debugfs\_remove function in
fs/debugfs/inode.c was fixed. (bnc#1159198).

## Details

Al Viro discovered that the Linux kernel for s390x systems did not properly

perform page table upgrades for kernel sections that use secondary address

mode. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-11884](/security/CVE-2020-11884))

It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-16234](/security/CVE-2019-16234))

Tristan Madani discovered that the block I/O tracing implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2019-19768](/security/CVE-2019-19768))

It was discovered that the vhost net driver in the Linux kernel contained a

stack buffer overflow. A local attacker with the ability to perform ioctl()

calls on /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2020-10942](/security/CVE-2020-10942))

It was discovered that the virtual terminal implementation in the Linux

kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-8648](/security/CVE-2020-8648))

Shijie Luo discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly check for a too-large journal size. An attacker

could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted,

could cause a denial of service (soft lockup). ([CVE-2020-8992](/security/CVE-2020-8992))

Jordy Zomer discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2020-9383](/security/CVE-2020-9383))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that the ADIS16400 IIO IMU Driver for the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19060](/security/CVE-2019-19060))

It was discovered that the vhost net driver in the Linux kernel contained a

stack buffer overflow. A local attacker with the ability to perform ioctl()

calls on /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2020-10942](/security/CVE-2020-10942))

It was discovered that the Serial CAN interface driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could use this to expose

sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2020-11494](/security/CVE-2020-11494))

It was discovered that the linux kernel did not properly validate certain

mount options to the tmpfs virtual memory file system. A local attacker

with the ability to specify mount options could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2020-11565](/security/CVE-2020-11565))

It was discovered that the OV51x USB Camera device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2020-11608](/security/CVE-2020-11608))

It was discovered that the STV06XX USB Camera device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2020-11609](/security/CVE-2020-11609))

It was discovered that the Xirlink C-It USB Camera device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2020-11668](/security/CVE-2020-11668))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

This update is now available for all supported architectures.  For
reference the original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-8839

    A race condition was found in the ext4 filesystem implementation.
    A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (filesystem corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes
    could trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access.
    An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a
    denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11
    (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger
    roaming for a newly associated station before the station was
    authenticated.  An attacker within range of the AP could use this
    to cause a denial of service, either by filling up a switching
    table or by redirecting traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
    implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks.  A user
    permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
    handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
    already has a link count of 0.  An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
    facility that could result in a use-after-free.  A local user able
    to trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

    The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully
    validate keycode changes, which could result in a heap
    out-of-bounds write.  A local user permitted to access the device
    node for an input or VT device could possibly use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

    Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
    read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
    read-write.  However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian
    kernel configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
    supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random
    value generated by these instructions may be used in a later
    speculative execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by applications, a
    local user or VM guest could use this to obtain sensitive
    information such as cryptographic keys from other users or VMs.

    This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either
    as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
    package in Debian's non-free archive section.  This kernel update
    only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
    disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

    Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top
    of IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by
    IPsec, IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility.  This could result
    in disclosure of information over the network, since it would not
    be encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2
    guests when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an
    L2 guest to cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or
    information leaks in the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in
    the vgacon driver.  A local user permitted to access a virtual
    terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
    driver, which could result in a use-after-free.  A local user
    permitted to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
    which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access.  A local user
    permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

    It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
    properly manage device lifetimes.  Removing a PTP hardware clock
    from the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
    use-after-free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
    handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
    attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly
    validate the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user
    permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack
    corruption via crafted system calls, resulting in denial of
    service (crash) or possibly privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver
    did not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets,
    resulting in an information leak from the kernel to user-space or
    over the CAN network.

CVE-2020-11565

    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did
    not correctly handle an "mpol" mount option specifying an empty
    node list, leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user
    namespaces are enabled, a local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
    drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors.  A
    physically present user with a specially constructed USB device
    could use this to cause a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
    pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs).  A local user
    with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can
    result in a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this can be
    exploited, but it could result in a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers.
    An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice,
    creating a race condition which could result in incorrect locking
    of internal data structures.  A local user permitted to access
    /dev/mptctl could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap
    buffer overflow.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an access point
    (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer overflow.  A malicious AP
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

    It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
    serialise access to its internal state.  The security impact of
    this is unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's
    binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not
    correctly release internal resources in a particular error case.
    A local user permitted to access an sg device could possibly use
    this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

    Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's
    permission checks.  A parent process can choose an arbitary signal
    for a child process to send when it exits, but if the parent has
    executed a new program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent.  A
    local user permitted to run a program for several days could
    bypass this check, execute a setuid program, and then send an
    arbitrary signal to it.  Depending on the setuid programs
    installed, this could have some security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in
    the USB gadget subsystem.  A local user permitted to write to
    the gadget configuration filesystem could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or potentially
    for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.84-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

# CVE-2020-8834

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-8832.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-8835.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-8834 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8834)

#### Description

KVM in the Linux kernel on Power8 processors has a conflicting use of HSTATE\_HOST\_R1 to store r1 state in kvmppc\_hv\_entry plus in kvmppc\_{save,restore}\_tm, leading to a stack corruption. Because of this, an attacker with the ability run code in kernel space of a guest VM can cause the host kernel to panic. There were two commits that, according to the reporter, introduced the vulnerability: f024ee098476 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Pull out TM state save/restore into separate procedures") 87a11bb6a7f7 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Work around XER[SO] bug in fake suspend mode") The former landed in 4.8, the latter in 4.17. This was fixed without realizing the impact in 4.18 with the following three commits, though it's believed the first is the only strictly necessary commit: 6f597c6b63b6 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Add guest MSR parameter for kvmppc\_save\_tm()/kvmppc\_restore\_tm()") 7b0e827c6970 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Factor fake-suspend handling out of kvmppc\_save/restore\_tm") 009c872a8bc4 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Move kvmppc\_save\_tm/kvmppc\_restore\_tm to separate file")

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-2732 CVE-2020-8428 CVE-2020-10942 CVE-2020-11565
                 CVE-2020-11884

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leak.

CVE-2020-2732

    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2
    guests when nested virtualization is enabled.  This could allow
    an L2 guest to cause privilege escalation, denial of service,
    or information leaks in the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8428

    Al Viro discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the VFS
    layer.  This allowed local users to cause a denial-of-service
    (crash) or obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2020-10942

    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly
    validate the type of sockets set as back-ends.  A local user
    permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack
    corruption via crafted system calls, resulting in denial of
    service (crash) or possibly privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11565

    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did
    not correctly handle an "mpol" mount option specifying an empty
    node list, leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write.  If user
    namespaces are enabled, a local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11884

    Al Viro reported a race condition in memory management code for
    IBM Z (s390x architecture), that can result in the kernel
    executing code from the user address space.  A local user could
    use this for privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.19.98-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Debian Bug     : 952660

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-2182

    Hanjun Guo and Lei Li reported a race condition in the arm64
    virtual memory management code, which could lead to an information
    disclosure, denial of service (crash), or possibly privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

    Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11
    (WiFi) stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger
    roaming for a newly associated station before the station was
    authenticated.  An attacker within range of the AP could use this
    to cause a denial of service, either by filling up a switching
    table or by redirecting traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

    Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
    implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks.  A user
    permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19462

    The syzbot tool found a missing error check in the 'relay'
    library used to implement various files under debugfs.  A local
    user permitted to access debugfs could use this to cause a denial
    of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

    Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
    facility that could result in a use-after-free.  A local user able
    to trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20806

    A potential null pointer dereference was discovered in the tw5864
    media driver.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-20811

    The Hulk Robot tool found a reference-counting bug in an error
    path in the network subsystem.  The security impact of this is
    unclear.

CVE-2020-0543

    Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
    supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random
    value generated by these instructions may be used in a later
    speculative execution on any core of the same physical CPU.
    Depending on how these instructions are used by applications, a
    local user or VM guest could use this to obtain sensitive
    information such as cryptographic keys from other users or VMs.

    This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update, either
    as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the intel-microcode
    package in Debian's non-free archive section.  This kernel update
    only provides reporting of the vulnerability and the option to
    disable the mitigation if it is not needed.

CVE-2020-2732

    Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2
    guests when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an
    L2 guest to cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or
    information leaks in the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8428

    Al Viro discovered a potential use-after-free in the filesystem
    core (vfs).  A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash) or possibly to obtain sensitive information from
    the kernel.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

    The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in
    the vgacon driver.  A local user permitted to access a virtual
    terminal (/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
    driver, which could result in a use-after-free.  A local user
    permitted to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

    Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
    which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access.  A local user
    permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-10711

    Matthew Sheets reported NULL pointer dereference issues in the
    SELinux subsystem while receiving CIPSO packet with null category. A
    remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of
    service (crash). Note that this issue does not affect the binary
    packages distributed in Debian as CONFIG_NETLABEL is not enabled.

CVE-2020-10732

    An information leak of kernel private memory to userspace was found
    in the kernel's implementation of core dumping userspace processes.

CVE-2020-10751

    Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
    handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
    attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10757

    Fan Yang reported a flaw in the way mremap handled DAX hugepages,
    allowing a local user to escalate their privileges

CVE-2020-10942

    It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly
    validate the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user
    permitted to access /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack
    corruption via crafted system calls, resulting in denial of
    service (crash) or possibly privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

    It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver
    did not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets,
    resulting in an information leak from the kernel to user-space or
    over the CAN network.

CVE-2020-11565

    Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did
    not correctly handle an "mpol" mount option specifying an empty
    node list, leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user
    namespaces are enabled, a local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

    It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
    drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors.  A
    physically present user with a specially constructed USB device
    could use this to cause a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
    pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs).  A local user
    with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

    Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can
    result in a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this can be
    exploited, but it could result in a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

    Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers.
    An ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice,
    creating a race condition which could result in incorrect locking
    of internal data structures.  A local user permitted to access
    /dev/mptctl could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap
    buffer overflow.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

    It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not
    sufficiently validate WMM parameters received from an access point
    (AP), resulting a potential heap buffer overflow.  A malicious AP
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly to execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12770

    It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not
    correctly release internal resources in a particular error case.
    A local user permitted to access an sg device could possibly use
    this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-13143

    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in
    the USB gadget subsystem.  A local user permitted to write to
    the gadget configuration filesystem could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or potentially
    for privilege escalation.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.9.210-1+deb9u1.  This version also fixes some
related bugs that do not have their own CVE IDs, and a regression in
the macvlan driver introduced in the previous point release (bug
#952660).

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

# CVE-2019-3701

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-3700.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-3773.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-3701 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-3701)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in can\_can\_gw\_rcv in net/can/gw.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.13. The CAN frame modification rules allow bitwise logical operations that can be also applied to the can\_dlc field. The privileged user "root" with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN can create a CAN frame modification rule that makes the data length code a higher value than the available CAN frame data size. In combination with a configured checksum calculation where the result is stored relatively to the end of the data (e.g. cgw\_csum\_xor\_rel) the tail of the skb (e.g. frag\_list pointer in skb\_shared\_info) can be rewritten which finally can cause a system crash. Because of a missing check, the CAN drivers may write arbitrary content beyond the data registers in the CAN controller's I/O memory when processing can-gw manipulated outgoing frames.
