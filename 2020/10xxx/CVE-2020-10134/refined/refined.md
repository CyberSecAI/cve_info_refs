The provided content relates to CVE-2020-10134.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a method confusion issue during the pairing process of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Basic Rate / Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) devices. Specifically, the Numeric Comparison (NC) and Passkey Entry (PE) Association Models are affected. The vulnerability arises because these models use the same form of check value, the user is not informed which model is being used, and devices don't authenticate the association model used by the peer device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Method Confusion:** The lack of differentiation between Numeric Comparison and Passkey Entry during pairing allows for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- **Lack of User Feedback:** Users are not clearly informed about which association model (NC or PE) is being used, making it difficult to detect an ongoing attack.
- **No Peer Authentication of Association Model:** Devices do not authenticate which association model is used by the peer device, allowing an attacker to force each device into different models.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful MITM attack allows an attacker to:
- Initiate any Bluetooth operation on either of the attacked devices that are exposed by the enabled Bluetooth profiles.
- Weaken device-local protections if the user assumes that the attacker is the intended device.

**Attack vectors:**
- An adjacent, unauthenticated attacker intercepts the pairing process.
- The attacker manipulates the association model negotiation to force one device into NC and the other into PE.
- The user mistakenly enters the NC value as a passkey on the device expecting a PE procedure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be within wireless range of two vulnerable Bluetooth devices establishing a new encrypted connection.
- The attacker needs to negotiate an NC procedure with one device and a PE procedure with the other.
- At least one device must permit entry of a passkey, and the other must support a display capable of representing six decimal digits.
