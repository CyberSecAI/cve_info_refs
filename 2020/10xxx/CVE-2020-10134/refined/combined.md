## Bluetooth devices supporting LE and specific BR/EDR implementations are vulnerable to method confusion attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#534195

Original Release Date: 2020-05-18 | Last Revised: 2020-05-26

---

### Overview

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Basic Rate / Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) Core Configurations are used for low-power short-range communications. To establish an encrypted connection, two Bluetooth devices must pair with each other using an agreed upon Association Model. It is possible for an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack the pairing process and force each victim device into a different Association Model, possibly granting the attacker the ability to initiate any Bluetooth operation on either attacked device.

### Description

| Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology based off of a [core specification](https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=457080) that defines six different core configurations, including the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Core Configuration. Like Bluetooth Classic (BR/ER), BLE is used for low-power short-range communications, but has significantly lower power consumption, making it ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) and other resource restricted devices. For two devices to communicate over BLE, they need to establish a connection by pairing via the (Low Energy) Secure Connections (SC or LESC) or Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) methods. The pairing process includes feature information exchange between devices on what they support, public key exchange, and authentication of the public keys using an Association Model. Two of the possible Association Models, Numeric Comparison (NC) and Passkey Entry (PE), are impacted by this attack.  An adjacent, unauthenticated attacker can intercept the credentials shared during the pairing process and force each victim device into a different Association Model. To do this, the attacker must negotiate an NC procedure with one device and a PE procedure with the other, and the user must erroneously enter the NC value as the public key value and accept pairing on the NC device. This scenario applies to both BLE Secure Connections pairing and BR/EDR Secure Simple Pairing. However, only a device operating as a keyboard for the purposes of pairing may be used to enter the passkey in the BR/EDR Secure Simple Pairing scenario. The attacker would be able to initiate any Bluetooth operation on either attacked device that is exposed by the enabled Bluetooth profiles.For this attack to be successful, an attacking device must be within wireless range of two vulnerable Bluetooth devices that are establishing either an LE or a BR/EDR encrypted connection without existing shared credentials (long term key or link key). At least one device must permit entry of a passkey, and the other must support a display capable of representing six decimal digits. This attack is possible because the Association Models NC and PE use the same form of check value, the model used is not indicated to the user (making it extremely difficult to notice the change), and the devices are not authenticating which Association Model is used by the peer device. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An adjacent, unauthenticated attacker could be able to initiate any Bluetooth operation on either attacked device exposed by the enabled Bluetooth profiles. This exposure may be limited when the user must authorize certain access explicitly, but so long as a user assumes that it is the intended remote device requesting permissions, device-local protections may be weakened. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Bluetooth host and controller suppliers should refer to the Bluetooth SIG's [statement](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/bluetooth-technology/bluetooth-security/method-vulnerability/) for guidance on updating their products. Downstream vendors should refer to their suppliers for updates. |

## Bluetooth SIG Statement Regarding the Method-Confusion Pairing Vulnerability

Researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have identified a security vulnerability related to Bluetooth LE Secure Connections Pairing and Secure Simple Pairing. The researchers identified that it is possible for an attacking device to successfully intercede as a man-in-the-middle between two pairing devices, provided that the attacker is able to negotiate a numeric compare pairing procedure with one device and a passkey pairing procedure with the other, and that the user erroneously enters the numeric compare value as the passkey and accepts pairing on the numeric compare device. This scenario is applicable to both LE Secure Connections Pairing and BR/EDR Secure Simple Pairing, however only devices operating as a keyboard for the purposes of pairing may be used to enter the passkey in the Secure Simple Pairing scenario.

Bluetooth products may exist in the field that do not clearly identify the difference between the six-digit numeric comparison value and the six-digit passkey. Any confusion on the part of the user authenticating the pairing may result in the man-in-the-middle becoming authenticated with the attacked devices instead of the attacked devices becoming authenticated with one another.

A man-in-the-middle successfully implementing this attack will be able to initiate any Bluetooth operation on either attacked device exposed by the enabled Bluetooth profiles on either device. This exposure may be further limited by requirements that the user authorize certain access, but if a user believes that it is the intended remote device requesting permissions, device-local protections may be weakened.

For this attack to be successful, an attacking device would need to be within wireless range of two vulnerable Bluetooth devices that were establishing either an LE or a BR/EDR encrypted connection either for the first time or after deletion of existing pairing credentials using either LE Secure Connections Pairing or BR/EDR Secure Simple Pairing.  The user must mistakenly enter the numeric compare value as the passkey and accept pairing on the numeric-compare device for the attacker to complete the pairing to both devices successfully. If the user accepts pairing on the numeric compare device, a pairing or bonding relationship will be set up between this device and the attacker, even if the passkey entry fails.

The Bluetooth SIG recommends that product developers introduce language to user interfaces and/or documentation that warns users to not enter the numeric comparison value on the remote pairing device or to not enter the numeric comparison value anywhere.

The Bluetooth SIG is also broadly communicating details on this vulnerability and its remedy to our member companies and is encouraging them to rapidly integrate any necessary patches. Bluetooth users should ensure they have installed the latest recommended updates from device and operating system manufacturers.
