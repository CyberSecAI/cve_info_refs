### How to validate the SBOMs on Replicated Releases

A software bill of materials (SBOM) is a list of components that make up a software product. Most all software products use a combination of open-source and commercial software components from third-party vendors. Because each element has potential security implications, awareness of these sometimes hidden components is critical to understanding any software's current and future cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Replicated has been delivering SBOMs alongside every KOTS, kURL, and Troubleshoot release for some time now. We have recently updated our documentation and processes to make it easier to validate SBOMs on releases.](/blog/how-to-validate-the-sboms-on-replicated-releases)[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/639a1c33ae68d6eabf2d6901/63e283dec40779868717338b_release%20roundup.png)Feb 7, 2023Â |Â Product & Engineering

# Gradle Enterprise 2019.5

Gradle Enterprise 2019.5 helps deal with the problem of flaky tests by identifying and analyzing flaky tests in individual builds and across many builds, and processes incoming build scans much more efficiently.

Read on for more details.

Use [version 1.3.6 of the Gradle Enterprise Maven extension](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.gradle/gradle-enterprise-maven-extension/1.3.6/jar), and [version 3.1.1 of the Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.build-scan/3.1.1) for optimal usage of Gradle Enterprise.

## [Highlights](#highlights)

### [Flaky test identification and analysis](#flaky-test-identification-and-analysis)

Gradle and Maven build scans now show a test as FLAKY when it was executed multiple times and reported at least 1 FAILED and 1 PASSED result, such as when using the new [Test Retry Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/gradle/test-retry-gradle-plugin) or specifying `rerunFailingTestsCount` when using the Maven Surefire or Maven Failsafe plugin.

![Build Scan with flaky test](https://gradle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/flaky-build-scan.png)

In addition, the top tests report in the Tests Dashboard now shows the tests that were the most flaky for your selected set of builds, along with an overall flaky tests trend chart.

![Tests Dashboard with top flaky tests](https://gradle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/flaky-top-tests.png)

The Tests Dashboard is available in 2019.5 as a partial preview of a larger set of testing-oriented functionality that will be available as an add-on package in upcoming Gradle Enterprise versions. Depending on your usage license, this new functionality may not be available to your installation when it is no longer in feature preview. If you have questions regarding this matter, please contact Gradle Enterprise support.

As you’d expect, you can drill down to see which methods are flakiest and list recent builds where a single test was flaky or failed.

![Visualize most flaky tests](https://gradle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/flaky-class-view.png)

Learn more in [this blog post](/blog/flaky-tests).

### [More efficient build scan collection and processing](#more-efficient-build-scan-collection-and-processing)

When a Gradle Enterprise enabled build is run, it publishes a record of what happened to the Gradle Enterprise server. The server then processes the raw data and transforms it into a form suitable for long term storage. This process involves aggressive deduplication of data and other transformations to minimize the storage space requirements.

Organizations that perform many builds each day and/or have large builds that do a lot of work can generate significant amounts of data to be processed, which can strain the Gradle Enterprise server and lead to delays in the availability of build scans after upload.

This data ingestion process has been improved to be more efficient in Gradle Enterprise 2019.5. This reduces the processing latency and reduces the CPU and memory usage of the server when processing large volumes of data.

## [Upgrade notes](#upgrade-notes)

If upgrading from a version of Gradle Enterprise prior to 2019.4, be sure to also consult the [release notes](/enterprise/releases) for all interim versions.

### [Temporarily degraded performance due to data reindexing](#temporarily-degraded-performance-due-to-data-reindexing)

Upon upgrading, a data reindexing process will be initiated in the background with Gradle Enterprise being usable for its duration. CPU usage will be increased and performance may be slightly degraded. For large installations storing many build scans, the reindexing process may take several hours. During this time some builds may be omitted from the Tests dashboard.
