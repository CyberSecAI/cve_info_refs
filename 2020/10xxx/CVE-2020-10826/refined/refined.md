Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-10826:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is a command injection flaw within the `/cgi-bin/activate.cgi` script. This occurs when the device is operating in `DEBUG` mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Command Injection:** The `/cgi-bin/activate.cgi` script, when in debug mode, logs debug data to a log file. It utilizes bash commands, and the `HTTP_REFERER` header is incorporated into these commands without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands by manipulating the `Referer` header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote, unauthorized attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the affected device. This can lead to a complete compromise of the device, including data exfiltration, modification of configurations, and potential use in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/activate.cgi`.
- **Referer Header Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious commands into the `Referer` header of the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
- **Device in Debug Mode:** The device must be operating in `DEBUG` mode for the vulnerability to be exploitable. This mode is typically enabled using the command `uci set fw_cf_license.fwlicense.debug=true`.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable by an unauthorized attacker, implying that authentication is not necessary to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Details from Content:**

- The content provides specific code snippets and pseudo-code illustrating the vulnerable logic.
- It includes an example exploit script demonstrating how to leverage the command injection vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects DrayTek Vigor 3900, 2960 and 300B models prior to firmware version 1.5.1.
- The content specifies that enabling debug mode is required using the command `uci set fw_cf_license.fwlicense.debug=true`.
