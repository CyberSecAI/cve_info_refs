x86/speculation: PR\_SPEC\_FORCE\_DISABLE enforcement for indirect branches.Currently, it is possible to enable indirect branch speculation even after
it was force-disabled using the PR\_SPEC\_FORCE\_DISABLE option. Moreover, the
PR\_GET\_SPECULATION\_CTRL command gives afterwards an incorrect result
(force-disabled when it is in fact enabled). This also is inconsistent
vs. STIBP and the documention which cleary states that
PR\_SPEC\_FORCE\_DISABLE cannot be undone.
Fix this by actually enforcing force-disabled indirect branch
speculation. PR\_SPEC\_ENABLE called after PR\_SPEC\_FORCE\_DISABLE now fails
with -EPERM as described in the documentation.
