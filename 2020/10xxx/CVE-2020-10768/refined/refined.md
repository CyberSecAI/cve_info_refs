```
{
  "Root cause": "The `prctl()` function could be used to enable indirect branch speculation even after it was force-disabled using the `PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE` option.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "The prctl() function did not properly enforce the forced disabling of indirect branch speculation.",
    "The PR_GET_SPECULATION_CTRL command provided an incorrect result after indirect branch speculation was re-enabled following a force-disable."
  ],
  "Impact": "A system vulnerable to Spectre v2 attacks if indirect branch speculation is re-enabled after being force disabled. This allows an attacker to potentially leak sensitive information through speculative execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could use the prctl() function to re-enable indirect branch speculation after it was force-disabled by a previous call to the same function with the PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE flag, leading to Spectre v2 vulnerability exploitation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute the `prctl()` system call. The position of the attacker is not specified, but system access is required."
