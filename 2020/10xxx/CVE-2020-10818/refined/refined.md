The provided content describes a post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Artica Proxy version 4.26.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the application handles hostname changes and the subsequent rebuilding of the DNS hosts file. By manipulating the hostname field to include shell commands, an attacker can achieve RCE when the hosts file is rebuilt.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability via the hostname field.
- Insufficient input sanitization/validation of the hostname field.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the web application.
- This can allow the attacker to gain complete control over the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must be authenticated as an administrator to access the vulnerable functionality (hostname change).
- The attacker must edit the hostname field to inject a malicious command.
- The attacker must then navigate to the DNS Hosts file section and trigger the "Build the file" action.
- This action triggers the execution of the malicious command injected in the hostname.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires valid administrator credentials to log in to the Artica Proxy web interface.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable area where hostname can be modified.
