The provided content is related to CVE-2020-10987.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper input sanitization in the `httpd` binary where the `deviceName` and `lanIp` parameters are passed directly to the `doSystemCmd` function, which allows arbitrary command execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router. This is achieved via the `doSystemCmd` function within the `httpd` binary by manipulating the `deviceName` or `lanIp` parameters.
- **Insufficient Data Validation and Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize user-controlled input fields, allowing for command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the router with root privileges.
- **Persistent Reverse Shell:** Attackers can establish a persistent reverse shell on the device, allowing ongoing control.
- **Botnet potential:** Exploited devices could be used in botnets for attacks on external systems.
- **Malware installation:**  Attackers can install persistent malware on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Authenticated Web Interface:**  An attacker can make authenticated requests to the web interface to set the vulnerable parameters.
- **Root Shell Access:**  Attackers can leverage a root shell obtained via a telnet daemon to set the vulnerable `lan.ip` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Initial foothold:** The attacker either needs to authenticate to the router's web interface or gain root shell access via the telnet daemon.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the router, either from the LAN or, potentially, from the WAN if the web interface is exposed to the Internet.
