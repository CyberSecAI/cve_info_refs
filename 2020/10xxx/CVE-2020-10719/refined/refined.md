Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10719:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Undertow, a web server, processes invalid HTTP requests with large chunk sizes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of chunked HTTP requests, specifically when large chunk sizes are involved.
- This leads to HTTP request smuggling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could perform HTTP request smuggling, which can lead to various impacts:
    - Disclosure of sensitive information
    - Addition or modification of data
    - Denial of Service (DoS)

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted, invalid HTTP request containing a large chunk size.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No specific authentication is mentioned, implying a network-based attack.
- The attacker needs to craft a specific HTTP request with a large chunk size.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple NetApp products that incorporate Undertow.
- Red Hat also mentions that the vulnerability is present in Undertow.
- The identified fix is upgrading to Undertow version 2.1.1.Final or later.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.5 (MEDIUM), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N, which corresponds to network-based attack, low complexity, no privileges needed, no user interaction, and low impact on confidentiality and integrity and no impact on availability.
- Red Hat Bugzilla includes the following description: "A flaw was found in Undertow, regarding the processing of invalid HTTP requests with large chunk sizes. This flaw allows an attacker to take advantage of HTTP request smuggling."
- Red Hat Bugzilla references multiple Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs) that have addressed this vulnerability in different Red Hat products, including Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, Red Hat Single Sign-On, Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes, and Red Hat Fuse.

The NetApp advisory states that OnCommand Workflow Automation is affected only by this CVE.
