Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Adobe ColdFusion installer fails to set secure access control lists (ACLs) on the default installation directory, such as `C:\ColdFusion2021\`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Default ACLs:** The primary vulnerability is the weak ACLs on the installation directory which allows unprivileged users to create files in the ColdFusion installation directory.
*   **DLL Search Order Hijacking:** The vulnerability can be exploited through DLL search order hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged Windows user can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By placing a specially-crafted DLL file in the ColdFusion installation directory, an attacker can run malicious code with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File Creation:** An attacker, with limited privileges, places a malicious DLL within the ColdFusion installation directory.
*   **DLL Hijacking:** The malicious DLL is loaded by a ColdFusion process due to the DLL search order, leading to code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the Windows system where Adobe ColdFusion is installed.
*   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker does not require administrative privileges to exploit this vulnerability, only the ability to create files within the vulnerable directory.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects various versions of ColdFusion (2016, 2018, and 2021).
*   The recommended solution is to use the ColdFusion Server Auto-Lockdown installer or follow the specific lockdown guides provided by Adobe for each version.
*   The vulnerability is due to insecure default configurations and permissions set during the installation process.

This information aligns with the official description of CVE-2020-10145, which indicates a privilege escalation vulnerability due to weak ACLs in Adobe ColdFusion, although the provided content gives specific information.
