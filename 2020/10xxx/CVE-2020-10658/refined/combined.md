Insider Threat Management Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities
# Insider Threat Management Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities

### Insider Threat Management Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: PFPT-SA-2020-0003

Advisory Version: 1.0

First Published: May 11, 2020

### Summary

Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server (formerly ObserveIT Server) contains multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities. A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with local administrator privileges.

Proofpoint has released fixed software versions that address these vulnerabilities. See the Fixed Software section below.

### Affected Versions

All versions of Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server prior to 7.9.1 are affected by these vulnerabilities. Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server version 7.9.1 includes the fix, so no action is required by customers already running that version. Otherwise, updating to a fixed version is highly recommended.

### Vulnerabilities

**CVE-2020-10655 - Remote Code Execution in Insider Threat Management Application Server WriteWindowMouse API**

CVSS: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server versions before 7.9.1 contain a vulnerability in the application server's WriteWindowMouse API. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with local administrator privileges. The vulnerability is caused by improper deserialization.

**CVE-2020-10656 – Remote Code Execution in Insider Threat Management Application Server WriteWindowMouseWithChunksV2 API**

CVSS: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server versions before 7.9.1 contain a vulnerability in the application server's WriteWindowMouseWithChunksV2 API. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with local administrator privileges. The vulnerability is caused by improper deserialization.

**CVE-2020-10657 – Remote Code Execution in Insider Threat Management Web Console**

CVSS: 7.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server versions before 7.9.1 contain a vulnerability in the web console's ImportAlertRules feature. The vulnerability allows an authenticated remote attacker with admin or config-admin privileges in the console to execute arbitrary code with local administrator privileges. The vulnerability is caused by improper deserialization.

**CVE-2020-10658 – Remote Code Execution in Insider Threat Management Application WriteImage API**

CVSS: 9.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server versions before 7.9.1 contain a vulnerability in the application server's WriteImage API. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with local administrator privileges. The vulnerability is caused by improper deserialization.

### Fixed Software

Proofpoint has released fixed software versions 7.5.3, 7.6.4, 7.7.4, 7.8.3, and 7.9.1

The fixed software versions are now available through the customer support portal.
