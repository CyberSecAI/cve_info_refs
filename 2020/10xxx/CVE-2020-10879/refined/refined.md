Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10879:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `search.crud.php` file of rConfig version 3.9.4. The `nodeId` parameter is vulnerable to command injection. The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the operating system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a remote command injection vulnerability via the `nodeId` parameter in `search.crud.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server running rConfig. This can lead to a full system compromise if the web server process has sufficient privileges. This includes potentially installing malware, creating backdoors, accessing sensitive data or using the compromised server as a pivot point for attacks on other systems.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The exploit is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `/lib/crud/search.crud.php` with a malicious payload within the `nodeId` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the rConfig server to send the malicious HTTP GET request.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid rConfig credentials to successfully login and trigger the exploit.
*   **Basic understanding of HTTP requests:** The attacker would need basic understanding of how to make HTTP requests and how to encode the payload.
