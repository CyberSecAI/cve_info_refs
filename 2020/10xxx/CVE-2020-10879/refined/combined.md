##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Frequent questions and answers

## Any Questions? Answered

We strive to make rConfig easy to choose, setup and use. If you have any questions, please feel free to
contact us. Here are some frequent questions we get asked about.

* What has
  happened to rConfig v3?

   As of February 2023 , this project is
  no longer maintained. rConfig v3 is fully deprecated and will no longer be supported on
  the public repository. It has been replaced by V6 Core. There is no direct upgrade path
  from V3 to V6 core. This notice does not affect customers with current subscription
  arrangements until the end of the term of those arrangements. rConfig v3 has been in
  development since 2010, and we are very proud of its impact and value for network
  professionals and businesses all over the globe. V3 Users should plan to migrate to V6
  Core ASAP.
* Do you
  have a trail version for V7 I can download?

   We've got your back with our 30-day
  Money Back Guarantee for all new subscribers. Dive into the full feature set worry-free,
  knowing that if rConfig doesn't match your expectations, you'll get a full refund. And
  check this out: our fresh V6 Core version lets you test-drive the core V7 features for
  free! You can contact us for a live demo and we will be happy to help.
* Why is
  rConfig V7 not free?

  We have spent 14 years building an amazing and valuable NCM, and 4 years dedicated to
  developing rConfig V7, a premium network management tool designed with
  enterprise-grade quality. We know that businesses depend on our tool and are prepared
  to invest in its continued development and exciting upcoming features. Plus, rConfig
  stands out by offering a fantastic return on investment (ROI) and remarkably low total
  cost of ownership (TCO). Unlike other Network Configuration Managers (NCMs), rConfig is
  investing in a strong innovative future with our flagship product.
* I work
  for non-profit, can I get rConfig V7 discounted?

  Yes. One of our core values is 'giving back', which is why we created rConfig as an open
  source, free project to begin with. Contact us directly for more information on our
  support for non-profit organisations. We require charity status for such Non-Profit
  organisations, and would need your charity ID with the request.

  Simply register an account on rConfig.com, login to the portal and apply for a discount
  by changing your team status and providing evidence of your status. A discount code for
  purchases will be assigned to your account.
* Which
  pricing plans should I choose?

  For hobbyists and small businesses, our
  V6 Core is an ideal NCM with unlimited backups, vendors and devices. The Pro plan suits networks with up to 1000 devices. For larger
  networks inclduing enterprise and MSPs, please contact us for pricing. This straightforward, tiered model
  simplifies pricing and removes any complexity.
* What are
  the plans for rConfig in the future?

  rConfig has been in developed over 14
  years, since 2010. We are aware that a few major NCM vendors are EOL-ing their products.
  And others have stagnated on product and service innovation, while most open source NCMs
  are unmaintained and unsecure. We are aware that the
  market is changing rapidly.
  Customers of all sizes are relying on rConfig and our product roadmap, integrations and
  innovations are unmatched. We are around for the long term, and look forward to the
  future of rConfig NCM and the introduction of key Automation Platform features.
