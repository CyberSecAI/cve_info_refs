Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-10675:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the `Delete` function of the `buger/jsonparser` library. Specifically, certain inputs to the `Delete` function can trigger an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `Delete` function within the `buger/jsonparser` library is vulnerable to an infinite loop condition.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of the library prior to the fix.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing malicious input to the vulnerable `Delete` function, leading to an infinite loop and rendering the application unresponsive.
- System availability is the primary threat.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `Delete` function of the `buger/jsonparser` library.
- An attacker needs to supply specially crafted JSON data to trigger the infinite loop when using the `Delete` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `Delete` function within the application using the vulnerable library.
- The attacker needs to be able to supply specially crafted JSON data to trigger the infinite loop.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by @wangcong15 on GitHub.
- A fix was implemented in commit `91ac96899e492584984ded0c8f9a08f10b473717` of the `buger/jsonparser` repository.
- The vulnerability affects versions of the `golang-github-buger-jsonparser` library before the fix.
- The fix is included in  `golang-github-buger-jsonparser-0-0.9.20200406gitf7e751e.fc32` for Fedora 32, and `golang-github-buger-jsonparser-0-0.8.20200406gitf7e751e.fc31` for Fedora 31.
- Some OpenShift containers have references to the vulnerable library in their `go.sum` files, but are not actually vulnerable because they do not use the library when building on Linux (it is a dependency only when building on Windows).
