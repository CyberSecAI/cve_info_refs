Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10049:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The start/stop scripts for the services of the SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager application have a vulnerability. These scripts allow a local attacker to include arbitrary commands that are then executed when the services are started or stopped interactively by system administrators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of Script Execution:** The scripts lack sufficient sanitization or validation of input, allowing injection of malicious commands.
*   **Incorrect Default Permissions (CWE-276):** While not explicitly stated as the cause, the vulnerability is classified under CWE-276 which indicates an issue with permissions related to how the scripts are executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged local user can escalate their privileges by injecting arbitrary commands to be executed with the permissions of the user starting/stopping the service (typically a system administrator).
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The injected commands can be used to execute any code on the system, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager is installed.
*   **Script Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the start/stop scripts to include malicious commands.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker relies on the system administrator to start or stop the service to trigger the execution of the injected commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-privileged local access:** The attacker needs a low-privileged local account on the machine.
*   **Ability to modify start/stop scripts:** The attacker needs write access to the script files or a way to manipulate them through other means.
*   **Exploit relies on administrator actions** The attacker has to rely on an administrator to start/stop the services to trigger the payload

**Additional Notes:**

*   The CVSS v3.1 base score for this vulnerability is 7.9, categorized as High severity.
*   The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C` which translates to:
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The vulnerability requires local access to exploit.
    *   **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** The vulnerability is easy to exploit.
    *   **PR:L (Privileges Required: Low):** The attacker needs low-level privileges.
    *   **UI:R (User Interaction: Required):** The exploit requires the user to interact with the system by manually starting or stopping the service.
    *   **S:C (Scope: Changed):**  The exploitation will change the security scope.
    *   **C:H (Confidentiality Impact: High):** There is high impact to confidentiality.
    *  **I:H (Integrity Impact: High):** There is a high impact on integrity
    *  **A:N (Availability Impact: None):** There is no impact on availability.
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is fixed in version V2.10.2 of SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager.
