Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-10385:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "Form Description" and "Field Description" fields of the WPForms plugin's Form Builder module. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious scripts injected into the form or field descriptions are stored in the database and executed when a user views the form or its settings.
- **Reflected XSS:** The form builder's "preview" function was also vulnerable to reflected XSS, where the malicious script is not stored but is executed upon a user previewing the form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform malicious actions on a WordPress site. This includes:
  - Stealing session cookies: By injecting JavaScript to send cookies to an attacker-controlled server.
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites: Redirecting users, including administrators, to phishing pages to steal credentials or other malicious purposes.
  - Performing actions on behalf of users: Impersonating the victim to change settings, add new users, etc.
- **WordPress Multisite Compromise:** The vulnerability is particularly concerning on WordPress multisite installations, as a successful exploit could allow an attacker to target a super administrator and compromise the entire network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves an authenticated attacker with the ability to create or modify forms in the WPForms plugin.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the "Form Description" or "Field Description" fields via the form builder interface.
- The injected script is stored in the WordPress database.
- When a user views the affected form or its settings, the stored script is executed within their browser.
- Additionally the preview functionality exposes a reflected XSS attack vector

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in WordPress user with sufficient privileges to create or modify forms using the WPForms plugin. This is not an unauthenticated vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects WPForms versions 1.5.8.2 and below.
- WPForms version 1.5.9 and later versions include a fix with improved data sanitization.
- The vulnerability was reported to the WPForms team on February 18, 2020, and the fix was released on March 5, 2020.
