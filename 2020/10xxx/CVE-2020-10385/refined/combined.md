#### Drag & Drop Contact Form Builder

> WPForms is by far the **easiest form plugin to use**. My clients love WPForms and it’s one of the few plugins they can use without any training. As a developer I appreciate how fast, modern, clean and extensible it is.
>
> Bill Erickson – Expert WordPress Consultant

#### Pre-built Form Templates

WPForms comes with [2000+ pre-built form templates](https://wpforms.com/templates/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin).

Whether you’re looking to create a simple contact form, marketing form, request a quote form, donation form, payment order form, registration form, Stripe payment form, or a subscription form, we have a form template already prepared and ready to use.

#### Mobile Ready, SEO Friendly, and Optimized for Speed

WPForms contact forms are 100% responsive and mobile-friendly. We optimized every query on the frontend and the backend to ensure that it’s one of the fastest WordPress contact form plugins.

You can embed your contact form on any page with an optimized title and description, so WPForms is one of the most SEO friendly contact form plugins too.

#### Fields & Features You Need to Succeed

With star ratings, file uploads, repeater fields, survey fields, and multi-page contact forms, you can easily build the right custom form for your site’s needs. Plus, integrate your contact forms with an email marketing service in just a few steps and collect payments with Stripe, PayPal, and Square for bookings and orders without the need for a dedicated eCommerce plugin.

See what one business owner has to say about their WPForms contact form:

> As a business owner, time is my most valuable asset. WPForms allows me to create smart contact forms with just a few clicks. With their pre-built form templates and the drag & drop builder, I can create a new form that works in less than 2 minutes without writing a single line of code. Well worth the investment.
>
> David Henzel – Co-founder of MaxCDN

#### Surveys & Polls

Create custom survey forms like Survey Monkey. Our [WordPress survey plugin addon](https://wpforms.com/features/surveys-and-polls-addon?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin) comes with smart survey fields including Likert scale, star ratings, and NPS. Embed your surveys and polls anywhere in WordPress.

Use our survey reporting tools to customize graphs, export them for presentations, and display aggregate results. You can also share poll results instantly when collecting votes.

#### Default WordPress Forms

Aside from building simple contact forms, WPForms also helps you create better default WordPress forms, like custom WordPress login forms and custom WordPress user registration forms. Create a password-protected contact form or even a members-only contact form.

Bloggers and publishers can use our WordPress post submission forms to accept guest posts, testimonials, and more.

#### Payment Forms, Donation Forms, Booking Forms, and More

While WPForms started out as a contact form plugin, it has evolved into a powerful custom forms solution for any type of payment or booking form.

WPForms integrates with PayPal, Stripe, Square Payments, and Authorize.Net so you can easily accept credit card payments or take payments via PayPal. Bonus: you can also take signatures.

We’re proud to be a Stripe Verified Partner. This partnership allows us to build the best Stripe integration with early access to features. You can use our Stripe integration to accept both one-time payments as well as recurring payments while syncing all form data to your Stripe account.

#### Custom Calculator Forms

Using the [WPForms Calculations addon](https://wpforms.com/features/calculations-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin), you can build custom formulas and display results on the frontend.

Create simple arithmetic calculations or build complex conditional calculations with rounded values, averages, time ranges, and more! It’s the best calculator plugin for WordPress.

#### Forms Optimized for Conversions

With our Form Pages addon, you can create distraction-free custom form landing pages to increase conversions.

To improve form completion rates, we created Conversational Forms which helps you make your feedback forms feel more human by adding an interactive layout. ([See Conversational Forms Demo](https://wpforms.com/features/conversational-forms-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin)).

#### Easy to Customize and Extend

You can easily customize your contact forms with our section dividers, HTML blocks, and CSS. Embedding forms in Elementor and Divi has never been easier thanks to our native integrations.

We also know that our developer friends may want more control, so we added tons of hooks and filters.

WPForms is absolutely, positively the most [beginner-friendly WordPress contact form plugin](https://wpforms.com/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin) on the market. It is both easy and powerful.

We took the pain out of creating online forms and made it easy. Check out all [WPForms features](https://wpforms.com/features/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteplugin).

Also, I’m the founder of [WPBeginner](https://www.wpbeginner.com/), the largest WordPress resource site for beginners. It was a huge priority for me to make a WordPress contact form plugin that beginners can use without any training.

I feel that we have done that here. I hope you enjoy using WPForms.

Utilizzo la versione PRO di WPForms da anni e mi ha aiutato a soddisfare le esigenze di tantissimi clienti. È uno strumento estremamente potente, versatile ed affidabile, il tutto sostenuto da un’assistenza clienti molto presente e reattiva. Per chi utilizza Ghutemberg, poi, è possibile personalizzare la veste grafica dei form con strumentazioni integrate, senza dover ricorrere a CSS.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# CVE : CVE-2020-10385

1. Description

WPForms is a popular WordPress forms plugin with over 3 million active installations. The Form Description and Field Description fields in the WPForms plugin’s Form Builder module was found to be vulnerable to stored XSS, as they did not sanitize user given input properly. While they do not pose high security threat being an authenticated XSS vulnerability, an attacker can potentially exploit this to perform malicious actions on a WordPress multisite installation to have a super admin’s cookies sent to the attacker or redirect the super admin to another domain, for example, a phishing page designed to show that they have been logged out and would need to log back in, thus compromising their credentials. The form builder’s “preview” function was also vulnerable to reflected XSS. All WordPress websites using WPForms version 1.5.8.2 and below are affected.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Stored XSS Vulnerability found in WPForms Plugin

March 5, 20202 min read

![](https://www.jinsonvarghese.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/home-image-2-906x484.png)

WPForms Plugin version 1.5.8.2 and below were found to be vulnerable to authenticated stored XSS while I was auditing the plugin. WPForms version 1.5.9 with improved data sanitization was released on March 5, 2020.

[**CVE-2020-10385**](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10385)

## **Summary**

WPForms is a popular WordPress forms plugin with over 3 million active installations. It was found to be vulnerable to authenticated Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. XSS is a type of vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers to perform various malicious actions such as stealing the victim’s session cookies or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on the victim’s behalf, logging their keystrokes and more.

## Vulnerability

The **Form Description** and **Field Description** fields in the WPForms plugin’s Form Builder module was found to be vulnerable to stored XSS, as they did not sanitize user given input properly.

Fig. 1—Stored XSS

While they do not pose high security threat being an authenticated XSS vulnerability, we were able to confirm that these can be potentially exploited by an attacker to perform malicious actions on a WordPress multisite installation to have a super admin’s cookies sent to the attacker or redirect the super admin (as shown below) to another domain, for example, a phishing page designed to show that they have been logged out and would need to log back in, thus compromising their credentials.

We were further able to find that the form builder’s “preview” function was also vulnerable to reflected XSS.

## **Timeline**

* Vulnerability reported to the WPForms team – February 18, 2020.
* WPForms version 1.5.9 containing the fix to the vulnerability released – March 5, 2020.

## **Recommendation**

It is highly recommended to update the plugin to the latest version.
