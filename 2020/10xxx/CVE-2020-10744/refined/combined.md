| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1835566#c0)  Borja Tarraso    2020-05-14 05:13:14 UTC  ``` This flaw refers to the incomplete fix for [CVE-2020-1733](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-1733) ansible: insecure temporary directory when running become_user from become directive. This vulnerability seems not mitigated fully as there race condition from the original flaw could still happen on systems using ACLs and FUSE filesystems. The 'mkdir -p' is insecure by design.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1835566#c1)  Borja Tarraso    2020-05-14 05:13:18 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Damien Aumaitre (Quarkslab), Nicolas Surbayrole (Quarkslab)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1835566#c3)  Borja Tarraso    2020-05-14 05:13:23 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Currently, there is no mitigation for this issue.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1835566#c8)  Borja Tarraso    2020-05-14 15:47:49 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1835854](show_bug.cgi?id=1835854 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2020-10744 ansible: incomplete fix for CVE-2020-1733 [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1835855](show_bug.cgi?id=1835855 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2020-10744 ansible: incomplete fix for CVE-2020-1733 [fedora-all]")] Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1835856](show_bug.cgi?id=1835856 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2020-10744 ansible: incomplete fix for CVE-2020-1733 [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1835566#c9)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2020-05-15 11:13:16 UTC  ``` Borja, has tis incomplete fix already been reported upstream?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1835566#c10)  Borja Tarraso    2020-05-15 12:00:44 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1835566#c9): > Borja, has tis incomplete fix already been reported upstream?  Hi Salvatore, it was found internally that it was insufficient fix. I expect someone to open an issue in github for upstream soon.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1835566#c13)  msiddiqu    2020-08-03 05:01:22 UTC  ``` References:   <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69782>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1835566#c14)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2020-12-20 16:33:53 UTC  ``` Hi  (In reply to msiddiqu from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=1835566#c13)) > References: >   > <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69782>  Can you share information what the upstream fix was to complete the fix? Can you share what is the commit in 2.9.10 which adresses the incomplete fix?  Regards, Salvatore   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1835566#c15)  Borja Tarraso    2020-12-22 11:20:00 UTC  ``` Hi Salvatore,  for solving the incomplete fix upstream we have this commit: 77d0effcc5b2da1ef23e4ba32986a9759c27c10d  Regards,  Borja Tarraso Red Hat Product Security   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1835566#c16)  Summer Long    2021-01-14 05:05:21 UTC  ``` Statement:  Ansible Engine 2.7.18, 2.8.12, and 2.9.9 as well as previous versions are affected.  Ansible Tower 3.4.5, 3.5.6 and 3.6.4 as well as previous versions are affected.  Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 and Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 no longer maintain their own versions of Ansible. The fix will be provided from core Ansible. However, we still ship Ansible separately for Ceph Ubuntu.  In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact,  ansible is not directly customer exposed, and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP ansible package.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1835566#c26)  Matt Davis    2021-10-12 23:31:01 UTC  ``` Closing as WONTFIX for older versions per Matt Martz.   ``` |  |
