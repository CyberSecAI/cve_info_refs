{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "The fix for CVE-2020-1733 was incomplete. The 'mkdir -p' command used to create temporary directories was still vulnerable to race conditions on systems using ACLs and FUSE filesystems.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary directory creation",
      "Race condition vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "A race condition could still occur when using `become_user` from the `become` directive, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate temporary directories used by Ansible.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation involves exploiting the race condition during the creation of temporary directories when using `become_user` with ACLs and FUSE filesystems.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to influence the timing and conditions of the temporary directory creation process. Specifically, they would need to be able to race against Ansible to manipulate the directory with ACLs and FUSE filesystems."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Ansible Engine 2.7.18 and earlier",
    "Ansible Engine 2.8.12 and earlier",
    "Ansible Engine 2.9.9 and earlier",
    "Ansible Tower 3.4.5 and earlier",
    "Ansible Tower 3.5.6 and earlier",
    "Ansible Tower 3.6.4 and earlier"
  ],
  "fixed_versions": [
    "ansible-engine 2.7.19",
    "ansible-engine 2.8.13",
    "ansible-engine 2.9.10"

    "mitigation": "No mitigation was available at the time of discovery."
