The provided content is related to CVE-2020-10538.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Epikur software stores user passwords as MD5 hashes in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of MD5 for password hashing, which is considered weak and vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- Lack of salt usage when hashing passwords, making rainbow table attacks feasible and speeding up the cracking process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker who gains access to the database can potentially recover user passwords by brute-forcing the MD5 hashes, or by using rainbow tables, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
Database Access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have access to the database where the MD5 password hashes are stored, implying a high privilege level on the system.
