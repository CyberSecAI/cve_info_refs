# NEWS

X41 D-Sec GmbH Security Advisory: X41-2020-003

# Multiple Vulnerabilities in Epikur

**Highest Severity Rating:** Critical

**Confirmed Affected Versions:** 20.1.0.1

**Confirmed Patched Versions:** 20.1.1

**Vendor:** Epikur Software & IT Services GmbH

**Vendor URL:** https://www.epikur.de/

**Credit:** X41 D-Sec GmbH, Eric Sesterhenn

**Status:** Public

**Advisory-URL:** https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2020-003-epikur

## Summary and Impact

Several flaws regarding authentication have been identified in Epikur, which allow attackers to access sensitive information. Among the issues identified is a backdoor password, weak password hashes and hardcoded credentials.

## Product Description

Epikur allows you to manage a medical office and patients.

# Backdoor Password

**Severity Rating:** Critical

**Vector:** Network

**CVE:** CVE-2020-10539

**CWE:** 798

**CVSS Score:** 10.0

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

## Analysis

The Epikur server contains the `checkPasswort()` function that, upon user login, checks the submitted password against the user passwordâs MD5 hash stored in the database. It is also compared to a second MD5 hash, which is the same for every user. If the submitted password matches either one, access is granted.

```
public boolean checkPasswort(String otherPassword) {
  return (otherPassword.equals(this.passwd) || otherPassword.equals("mhEVfZUMEwwvr8b9SEpLhA=="));
}
```

Brute-forcing the second hash reveals that the password `3p1kursupport` will allow you to login as any user.

# Passwords stored as MD5 Hash

**Severity Rating:** Medium

**Vector:** Database Access

**CVE:** CVE-2020-10538

**CWE:** 916

**CVSS Score:** 6.0

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

## Analysis

Epikur stores the secret passwords of the users as an MD5 hash in the database. MD5 can be brute-forced efficiently and should not be used for such purposes. Additionally, since no salt is used, rainbow tables can speed up the attack.

# Glassfish Administrator Password Not Set

**Severity Rating:** Medium

**Vector:** Local Network Interface

**CVE:** CVE-2020-10537

**CWE:** 258

**CVSS Score:** 6.8

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L

## Analysis

A Glassfish 4.1 server with default configuration is running on TCP port 4848. No password is required to access it with the administrator account.
