Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-10140:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is improper Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the `C:\ProgramData\Acronis` directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the fact that Acronis True Image 2021 does not properly set ACLs (permissions) on the `C:\ProgramData\Acronis` directory. This allows unprivileged users to write to this directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   By placing a malicious DLL (Dynamic Link Library) within the `C:\ProgramData\Acronis` directory (or one of its subdirectories), an unprivileged user can achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges. This is because certain privileged Acronis processes are executed from this directory.
*   The vulnerability enables privilege escalation, allowing a low-privilege user to gain complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have user-level access to the vulnerable Windows system.
*   The attacker leverages the ability to write to the `C:\ProgramData\Acronis` directory by placing a malicious DLL there.
*   The attacker relies on the vulnerable application's execution flow which loads the malicious DLL with SYSTEM privileges. This is an example of a DLL hijacking.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a local user on the Windows machine with Acronis True Image 2021 installed.
*   The attacker does not need elevated privileges initially. They can leverage the vulnerability to gain SYSTEM access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The CERT/CC vulnerability note mentions that the vulnerability is addressed in Acronis True Image 2021 build 32010.
*   The vulnerability can be described as a DLL Search Order Hijacking vulnerability.
*   The provided Acronis release notes do not specifically mention CVE-2020-10140 directly but links to a page with security updates.
