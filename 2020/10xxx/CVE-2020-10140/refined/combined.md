For more information about security updates, see [List of fixed security vulnerabilities of Acronis True Image](https://security-advisory.acronis.com/updates/UPD-2201-f76f-838c).

### System requirements

Hardware requirements

* Intel CORE 2 Duo (2 GHz) or equivalent processor that supports SSE instructions.

Operating systems

* Windows 10 (most editions, including October 2020 Update, except for Windows IoT editions)
* Windows 8.1
* Windows 8
* Windows 7 SP1 (all editions)
* Windows Home Server 2011

Beta builds are not supported.

Windows Embedded, IoT editions, Windows 10 LTSB, and Windows 10 LTSC are not supported.

It is possible for the software to work on other Windows operating systems, but it is not guaranteed.

File systems

* NTFS
* Ext2/Ext3/Ext4
* ReiserFS(3). File systems are supported only for backup and recovery of disks or partitions.
* Linux SWAP. File systems are supported only for backup and recovery of disks or partitions.
* HFS+/HFSX. Disk recovery, partition recovery, and cloning operations are supported without resizing.
* FAT16/32/exFAT. Disk recovery, partition recovery, and cloning operations are supported without resizing.

If a file system is not supported or is corrupted, Acronis True Image can copy data by using a sector-by-sector approach.

Storage media

* Hard disk drives (HDD)
* Solid-state drives (SSD)
* Networked storage devices
* FTP servers. The FTP server must allow file transfers in the passive mode. Acronis True Image splits a backup into files with a size of 2 GB when backing up directly to an FTP server.

## Acronis backup software contains multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#114757

Original Release Date: 2020-10-12 | Last Revised: 2020-10-12

---

### Overview

Acronis True Image, Cyber Backup, and Cyber Protection all contain privilege escalation vulnerabilities, which can allow an unprivileged Windows user to be able to run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

### Description

**CVE-2020-10138**

Acronis Cyber Backup 12.5 and Cyber Protect 15 include an OpenSSL component that specifies an `OPENSSLDIR` variable as a subdirectory within `C:\jenkins_agent\`. Acronis Cyber Backup and Cyber Protect contain a privileged service that uses this OpenSSL component. Because unprivileged Windows users can create subdirectories off of the system root, a user can create the appropriate path to a specially-crafted `openssl.cnf` file to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

**CVE-2020-10139**

Acronis True Image 2021 includes an OpenSSL component that specifies an `OPENSSLDIR` variable as a subdirectory within `C:\jenkins_agent\`. Acronis True Image contains a privileged service that uses this OpenSSL component. Because unprivileged Windows users can create subdirectories off of the system root, a user can create the appropriate path to a specially-crafted `openssl.cnf` file to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

**CVE-2020-10140**

Acronis True Image 2021 fails to properly set ACLs of the `C:\ProgramData\Acronis` directory. Because some privileged processes are executed from the `C:\ProgramData\Acronis` directory, an unprivileged user can achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges by placing a DLL in one of several paths within `C:\ProgramData\Acronis`.

### Impact

By placing a specially-crafted `openssl.cnf` or DLL file in a specific location, an unprivileged user may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a Windows system with the vulnerable Acronis software installed. See [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001/) for more details.

### Solution

#### Apply an update

These vulnerabilities are addressed in Acronis True Image 2021 build 32010 ([release notes](https://www.acronis.com/en-us/support/updates/changes.html?p=42226)), Acronis Cyber Backup 12.5 build 16363 ([release notes](https://dl.managed-protection.com/u/backup/rn/12.5/user/en-US/AcronisBackup12.5_relnotes.htm)), and Acronis Cyber Protect 15 build 24600 ([release notes](https://dl.managed-protection.com/u/cyberprotect/rn/15/user/en-US/AcronisCyberProtect15_relnotes.htm)).
