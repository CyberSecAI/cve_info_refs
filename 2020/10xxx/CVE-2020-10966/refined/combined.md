# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@mdisec](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4004716?u=1f864c7e50f9084003ce3e68dbb4f144773c8a2e&v=4&size=48)[mdisec](https://github.com/mdisec)opened [on Mar 23, 2020](https://github.com/hestiacp/hestiacp/issues/748#issue-585959832)

Tbh, vulnerability is pretty simple. On line 33. $\_SERVER['HTTP\_HOST’] value is directly used without any validation and then on line 34. E-mail send to the targeted account’s email address.

[hestiacp/web/reset/index.php](https://github.com/hestiacp/hestiacp/blob/5ffb7acd577a0b40bd735c89cb5b2d03e717e989/web/reset/index.php#L33)

Line 33
in
[5ffb7ac](/hestiacp/hestiacp/commit/5ffb7acd577a0b40bd735c89cb5b2d03e717e989)

|  | $mailtext .= \_\_('PASSWORD\_RESET\_REQUEST',$\_SERVER['HTTP\_HOST'],$user,$rkey,$\_SERVER['HTTP\_HOST'],$user,$rkey); |
| --- | --- |

Content of the password reset e-mail is generated by using following string definition.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4004716/77287448-a84b3380-6ce6-11ea-83ac-3b599e5d8eb6.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4004716/77287448-a84b3380-6ce6-11ea-83ac-3b599e5d8eb6.png)

So that means, $\_SERVER['HTTP\_HOST’]value is used for URL generation in e-mail template and we can fully control it.

We can spoof $\_SERVER['HTTP\_HOST’]value during HTTP request to the password reset endpoint.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4004716/77287478-bdc05d80-6ce6-11ea-9520-3e707e605bf5.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4004716/77287478-bdc05d80-6ce6-11ea-9520-3e707e605bf5.png)

Actual Host header value İS NOT hacker.com but the URL will be hacker.com in the password reset e-mail. As you can following screenshot, even though the Vesta is being installed on 192.168.74.163 on port 8060, URL placed in the e-mail for account recovery is HACKER.com now. So if the admin user click on that link in the e-mail, HACKER.COM will steal the code value which is enough for resetting password of the admin user.

PS: I should mention that in the real-life use-case you can very similar domain name instead of hacker.com :) Since the e-mail is being sanded from Vesta server, it’s not a kind of phishing attack.

**Suggested Fix**

According to technical details of the installation, Vesta installs it’s own Apache, Nginx and bunch of services. That means %90 of the real-life deployment is standalone server. By saying that I mean, there is no different service in front of the Vesta where might be validation on Host field of request header.

This vulnerability could have been mitigated by doing Nginx configuration, which is being used as reverse-proxy in the product, or even can be Apache without touching PHP side. But default Vesta configuration gives your chance to work with Host field.

**Side Note**

I've found & successfully tested that vulnerability during analysis of Vesta ! I haven't tested it against HestiaCp but I strongly believe it's also works too.

[@dpeca](https://github.com/dpeca) I've tested this solution, but fails because "$hostname" doesn't take into account the port, so the link sent for resetting the password is wrong and doesn't work.

For example, if I use <https://myvestaserver.com:8083> for accessing VestaCP, the mail will send <https://myvestaserver.com/reset/?action=confirm>...

Sorry, something went wrong.
