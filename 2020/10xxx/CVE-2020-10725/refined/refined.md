  "CVE-2020-10725": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in DPDK version 19.11 and above that allows a malicious guest to cause a segmentation fault of the vhost-user backend application running on the host, which could result in a loss of connectivity for the other guests running on that host. This is caused by a missing validity check of the descriptor address in the function `virtio_dev_rx_batch_packed()`.",
    "affected_versions": "v19.11+",
    "root_cause": "Missing validity check of the descriptor address in the `virtio_dev_rx_batch_packed()` function.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Missing input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious guest can cause a segmentation fault of the vhost-user backend application on the host, leading to loss of connectivity for other guests on the same host.",
    "attack_vector": "Sending invalid Virtio descriptors from a malicious guest.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious guest with the ability to send network traffic to the vhost-user backend.",
        "additional_info": "The vulnerability exists because `virtio_dev_rx_batch_packed()` doesn't check if the provided descriptor address is valid. This allows a malicious guest to pass an invalid address, leading to a segfault in the vhost-user backend application."
