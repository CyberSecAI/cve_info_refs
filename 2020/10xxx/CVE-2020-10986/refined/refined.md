Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-10986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient request validation. The `/goform/SysToolReboot` endpoint can be accessed without any specific checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The router's web interface doesn't have protection against CSRF attacks. A GET request to the `/goform/SysToolReboot` endpoint can be triggered remotely by an attacker if a user is authenticated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can remotely force the router to reboot, disrupting network connectivity for approximately 45 seconds. This can be achieved by convincing a logged-in user to visit a malicious website controlled by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker can host a malicious page that includes an HTML `<img>` tag with the reboot URL as the `src` attribute. When an authenticated user visits this page, the browser will automatically send the reboot request to the router.
*   **Social Engineering:**  An attacker can trick an authenticated user into directly accessing the reboot URL (`http://192.168.0.1/goform/SysToolReboot`) via a link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs a way to get a user, already authenticated to the router, to access a URL or a page under the attacker's control.
*   No direct access to the router is needed. The attack is performed through the victim's browser.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability allows for a simple but effective DoS attack against the router.
*   The content provides a clear explanation of how the CSRF vulnerability can be exploited.
