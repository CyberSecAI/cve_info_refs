  "CVE-2020-10703": {
    "description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate Libvirt. Libvirt versions 3.10.0 prior to 6.0.0 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to Denial of Service (DoS). A NULL pointer dereference was found in the libvirt API responsible for fetching a storage pool based on its target path. In more detail, this flaw affects storage pools created without a target path such as network-based pools like gluster and RBD. Unprivileged users with a read-only connection could abuse this flaw to crash the libvirt daemon, resulting in a potential denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "A NULL pointer dereference in the `storagePoolLookupByTargetPathCallback` function when handling storage pools without target paths.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) due to a crash of the libvirt daemon.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Calling the `virStoragePoolLookupByTargetPath` API with an empty path ('')"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An unprivileged user with a read-only connection to libvirt is required. A storage pool with no target path must already exist.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered through the `virStoragePoolLookupByTargetPath` public API method which then calls the vulnerable callback function via `virStoragePoolObjListSearch()`. The affected internal function `storagePoolLookupByTargetPathCallback` was introduced in libvirt upstream version v3.10.0, and the `virStoragePoolLookupByTargetPath` method was exposed as a public API in version 4.1.0. Versions of `libvirt` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are not affected as they do not include the vulnerable code."
