# MISP 2.4.123 released

A new version of MISP ([2.4.123](https://github.com/MISP/MISP/tree/v2.4.123)) has been released. This version includes various security related fixed, and a new Dashboard system.

# Security fixes

Thanks to a pentest conducted on behalf of the Centre for Cyber Security Belgium (CCB), we have received a list of ideas to improve our security posture along with 2 vulnerabilities:

* 2 XSS vulnerabilities (reported and fixed, more info via [CVE-2020-10246](https://www.misp-project.org/security) and [CVE-2020-10247](https://www.misp-project.org/security))
* various improvements for our password policy
* Improvements by adding preventative headers
* Providing the more information to the users by revealing potential foul play

We would hereby like to thank both the contracted part as well as CCB for sharing the results with us. We are always glad to receive pentest results, it's a great way for organisations to improve the security of MISP and we highly encourage everyone to MISP for potential issues and to [let us know](https://www.misp-project.org//security) - we will do our best to fix any identified issues as soon as possible.

# Dashboard system

As an outcome of the spread of COVID-19, we ourselves at the MISP-project team have spent a considerable amount of our free time over the past few weeks tracking the spread of and informing ourselves in regards to the outbreak.

As an outcome of quickly setting up a Coronavirus-sharing community via MISP for ourselves, in order to share and track information emerging about COVID-19, we have implemented a whole new Dashboarding functionality for MISP.

The new Dashboard is accessible directly in MISP and fully customisable by users.

* The system relies on bundled and custom widgets
* widgets work similarly to other modular parts of MISP, design your own, drop it in the MISP directory to get started
* For instructions on how to develop a basic widget visit [The training slide repository](https://www.misp-project.org/misp-training/a.a-widget-dev.pdf)
* Under the hood it uses the user settings system, allowing for custom configurations per user
* Dashboard templates can be saved and shared, both via MISP and via JSON configuration files
* Widgets come with a host of support functionalities (ACL, caching, auto-reloading, configuration systems)

We welcome contributions to our ever growing widget collection from our community, let us know if you want to get involved in the effort!

If you are interested in the covid-19 specific widgets, they are not included in the code-base directly, but are rather available via the new [widget-collection](https://github.com/MISP/widget-collection) library.

# Selecting your home page within MISP

Users an now replace their landing page from it redirecting to the event index to any other page in MISP. We recommend the consideration of switching to the dashboard as the first point of entry. Simply navigate to the page you wish to bookmark and click on the little star icon in the header bar.

# A bug affecting correlations and an interesting bug hunt

Due to a recently introduced bug, we had cases of correlations disappearing after an attribute edit under certain conditions (any edit not touching fields used to decide on whether to correlate an attribute). We have resolved the issue along with a full recorrelation being triggered on update, simply fetch the latest version of MISP and your instance should have the issue resolved once the job finishes.

# Acknowledgement

We would like to thank all the [contributors](https://www.misp-project.org/contributors), reporters and users who have helped us in the past months to improve MISP and information sharing at large. This release includes multiple updates in [misp-objects](https://www.misp-project.org/objects.html), [misp-taxonomies](https://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.html) and [misp-galaxy](https://www.misp-project.org/galaxy.html).

As always, a detailed and [complete changelog is available](https://www.misp-project.org/Changelog.txt) with all the fixes, changes and improvements.

# Security Advisories and Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

## Reporting security vulnerabilities for MISP or related MISP project repositories

Reporting security vulnerabilities is of great importance for us, as MISP is used in multiple critical infrastructures.

In the case of a security vulnerability report, we ask the reporter to send it directly to [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/contact/), if possible encrypted with the following GnuPG key: **CA57 2205 C002 4E06 BA70 BE89 EAAD CFFC 22BD 4CD5**. We usually fix reported and confirmed security vulnerabilities in less than 48 hours, followed by a software release containing the fixes within the following days.

If you report security vulnerabilities, do not forget to **tell us if and how you want to be acknowledged** and if you already requested CVE(s). Otherwise, we will request the CVE(s) directly.

As one of the critical user-bases of MISP consists of the CSIRT community, it is our duty to clearly state which bug could be abused and have a security impact on a MISP instance. CVE assignment is performed even for minor bugs suspected of having a security impact. This allows every user with MISP instances set up in their environments to understand which bugs could impact their security.

We firmly believe that, even though unfortunately it is often not regarded as common practice in our industry, being as transparent as possible about vulnerabilities, no matter how minor, is of crucial importance. At MISP Project, we care about the security of our users and prefer to have a high number of published CVEs rather than sweeping some of them under the rug.

## Advisories

* [CVE-2015-5719](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2015-5719) <= MISP 2.3.92 - app/Controller/TemplatesController.php in Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) before 2.3.92 does not properly restrict filenames under the tmp/files/ directory, which has unspecified impact and attack vectors.
* [CVE-2015-5720](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2015-5720) <= MISP 2.3.89 - Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the template-creation feature in Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) before 2.3.90 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving (1) add.ctp, (2) edit.ctp, and (3) ajaxification.js.
* [CVE-2015-5721](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2015-5721) <= MISP 2.3.89 - Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) before 2.3.90 allows remote attackers to conduct PHP object injection attacks via crafted serialized data, related to TemplatesController.php and populate\_event\_from\_template\_attributes.ctp.
* [CVE-2017-7215](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2017-7215) <= MISP 2.4.68 - Cross site scripting in some view elements in the index filter tool in app/webroot/js/misp2.4.68.js and the organisation landing page in app/View/Organisations/ajax/landingpage.ctp of MISP before 2.4.69 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.
* [CVE-2017-13671](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2017-13671) <= MISP 2.4.79 - app/View/Helper/CommandHelper.php in MISP before 2.4.79 has persistent XSS via comments. It only impacts the users of the same instance because the comment field is not part of the MISP synchronisation.
* [CVE-2017-14337](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2017-14337) <= MISP 2.4.79 - When MISP before 2.4.80 is configured with X.509 certificate authentication (CertAuth) in conjunction with a non-MISP external user management ReST API, if an external user provides X.509 certificate authentication and this API returns an empty value, the unauthenticated user can be granted access as an arbitrary user.
* [CVE-2017-15216](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2017-15216) <= MISP 2.4.81 - MISP before 2.4.81 has a potential reflected XSS in a quickDelete action that is used to delete a sighting, related to app/View/Sightings/ajax/quickDeleteConfirmationForm.ctp and app/webroot/js/misp.js.
* [CVE-2017-16802](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2017-16802) <= MISP 2.4.82 - In the sharingGroupPopulateOrganisations function in app/webroot/js/misp.js in MISP 2.4.82, there is XSS via a crafted organisation name that is manually added.
* [CVE-2017-16946](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2017-16946) <= MISP 2.4.82 - The admin\_edit function in app/Controller/UsersController.php in MISP 2.4.82 mishandles the enable\_password field, which allows admins to discover a hashed password by reading the audit log.
* [CVE-2018-6926](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2018-6926) <= MISP 2.4.87 - In app/Controller/ServersController.php in MISP 2.4.87, a server setting permitted the override of a path variable on certain Red Hed Enterprise Linux and CentOS systems (where rh\_shell\_fix was enabled), and consequently allowed site admins to inject arbitrary OS commands. The impact is limited by the setting being only accessible to the site administrator.
* [CVE-2018-8948](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2018-8948) <= MISP 2.4.89 - In MISP before 2.4.89, app/View/Events/resolved\_attributes.ctp has multiple XSS issues via a malicious MISP module.
* [CVE-2018-8949](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2018-8949) <= MISP 2.4.89 - An issue was discovered in app/Model/Attribute.php in MISP before 2.4.89. There is a critical API integrity bug, potentially allowing users to delete attributes of other events. A crafted edit for an event (without attribute UUIDs but attribute IDs set) could overwrite an existing attribute.
* [CVE-2018-11245](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2018-11245) <= MISP 2.4.91 - app/webroot/js/misp.js in MISP 2.4.91 has a DOM based XSS with cortex type attributes.
* [CVE-2018-11562](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2018-11562) <= MISP 2.4.91 - An issue was discovered in MISP 2.4.91. A vulnerability in app/View/Elements/eventattribute.ctp allows reflected XSS if a user clicks on a malicious link for an event view and then clicks on the deleted attributes quick filter.
* [CVE-2018-12649](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2018-12649) <= MISP 2.4.92 - An issue was discovered in app/Controller/UsersController.php in MISP 2.4.92. An adversary can bypass the brute-force protection by using a PUT HTTP method instead of a POST HTTP method in the login part, because this protection was only covering POST requests.
* [CVE-2018-19908](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2018-19908) <= MISP 2.4.98 - An issue was discovered in MISP 2.4.9x before 2.4.99. In app/Model/Event.php (the STIX 1 import code), an unescaped filename string is used to construct a shell command. This vulnerability can be abused by a malicious authenticated user to execute arbitrary commands by tweaking the original filename of the STIX import.
* [CVE-2019-9482](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2019-9482) <= MISP 2.4.102 - In MISP 2.4.102, an authenticated user can view sightings that they should not be eligible for. Exploiting this requires access to the event that has received the sighting. The issue affects instances with restrictive sighting settings (event only / sighting reported only).
* [CVE-2019-10254](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2019-10254) <= MISP 2.4.105 - In MISP before 2.4.105, the app/View/Layouts/default.ctp default layout template has a Reflected XSS vulnerability.
* [CVE-2019-11812](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2019-11812) <= MISP 2.4.107 - A persistent XSS issue was discovered in app/View/Helper/CommandHelper.php in MISP before 2.4.107. JavaScript can be included in the discussion interface, and can be triggered by clicking on the link.
* [CVE-2019-11813](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2019-11813) <= MISP 2.4.107 - An issue was discovered in app/View/Elements/Events/View/value\_field.ctp in MISP before 2.4.107. There is persistent XSS via link type attributes with javascript:// links.
* [CVE-2019-11814](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2019-11814) <= MISP 2.4.107 - An issue was discovered in app/webroot/js/misp.js in MISP before 2.4.107. There is persistent XSS via image names in titles, as demonstrated by a screenshot.
* [CVE-2019-12794](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2019-12794) <= MISP 2.4.108 - An issue was discovered in MISP 2.4.108. Organization admins could reset credentials for site admins (organization admins have the inherent ability to reset passwords for all of their organization’s users).
* [CVE-2019-12868](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2019-12868) <= MISP 2.4.109 - app/Model/Server.php in MISP 2.4.109 allows remote command execution by a super administrator because the PHP file\_exists function is used with user-controlled entries, and phar:// URLs trigger deserialization.
* [CVE-2019-14286](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2019-14286) <= MISP 2.4.111 - In app/webroot/js/event-graph.js in MISP 2.4.111, a stored XSS vulnerability exists in the event-graph view when a user toggles the event graph view. A malicious MISP event must be crafted in order to trigger the vulnerability.
* [CVE-2019-16202](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2019-16202) <= MISP 2.4.114 - MISP before 2.4.115 allows privilege escalation in certain situations. After updating to 2.4.115, escalation attempts are blocked by the checkLoggedActions function with a “This could be an indication of an attempted privilege escalation on older vulnerable versions of MISP (<2.4.115)” message.
* [CVE-2019-19379](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2019-19379) <= MISP 2.4.118 - MISP before 2.4.119 In app/Controller/TagsController.php in MISP 2.4.118, users can bypass intended restrictions on tagging data.
* [CVE-2020-8890](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2020-8890) <= MISP 2.4.120 - An issue was discovered in MISP before 2.4.121. It mishandled time skew (between the machine hosting the web server and the machine hosting the database) when trying to block a brute-force series of invalid requests.
* [CVE-2020-8891](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2020-8891) <= MISP 2.4.120 - An issue was discovered in MISP before 2.4.121. It did not canonicalize usernames when trying to block a brute-force series of invalid requests.
* [CVE-2020-8892](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2020-8892) <= MISP 2.4.120 - An issue was discovered in MISP before 2.4.121. It did not consider the HTTP PUT method when trying to block a brute-force series of invalid requests.
* [CVE-2020-8893](https://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2020-8893) <= MISP 2.4.120 - An issue was discovered in MISP before 2.4.121. The Galaxy view contained an incorrectly sanitized search string in app/View/Galaxies/view.ctp.
