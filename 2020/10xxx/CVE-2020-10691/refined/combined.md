[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-3c67-gc48-983w/dependabot)

## Package

pip

ansible
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 2.9.0a1, < 2.9.7

## Patched versions

2.9.7

## Description

An archive traversal flaw was found in all ansible-engine versions 2.9.x prior to 2.9.7, when running `ansible-galaxy collection` install. When extracting a collection .tar.gz file, the directory is created without sanitizing the filename. An attacker could take advantage to overwrite any file within the system.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1817161#c0)  Borja Tarraso    2020-03-25 17:39:45 UTC  ``` ansible-galaxy collection install has a archive traversal vulnerability when extracing a collection .tar.gz file, neither install() nor the called _extract_tar_file() does any sanitizing on the filename. This should allow a specially crafted collection .tar.gz file to place a file wherever it wants in the file system.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1817161#c3)  Borja Tarraso    2020-03-25 17:40:02 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  A possible mitigation of archive traversal issue could be done by restricting file access control and directory write accesses for extracting tarball files. This is feasible only for scenarios when the destination path could be known and enforced beforehand.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1817161#c8)  Borja Tarraso    2020-03-27 07:34:07 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Felix Fountein   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1817161#c11)  Borja Tarraso    2020-03-27 11:19:52 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1817979](show_bug.cgi?id=1817979 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-10691 ansible: archive traversal vulnerability in ansible-galaxy collection install [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1817980](show_bug.cgi?id=1817980 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-10691 ansible: archive traversal vulnerability in ansible-galaxy collection install [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1817161#c13)  Summer Long    2020-03-30 05:42:39 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1818683](show_bug.cgi?id=1818683 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2020-10691 ansible: archive traversal vulnerability in ansible-galaxy collection install [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1817161#c14)  Borja Tarraso    2020-04-01 05:25:36 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/68596>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1817161#c16)  Hardik Vyas    2020-04-16 05:28:05 UTC  ``` Statement:  Ansible Engine 2.9.6 as well as previous 2.9.x versions are affected.

Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy and maintain. Automate everything from code deployment to network configuration to cloud management, in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems. <https://docs.ansible.com>.

# Ansible

Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles
configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning,
ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. Ansible makes complex
changes like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy. More information on the Ansible [website](https://ansible.com/).

## Design Principles

* Have an extremely simple setup process with a minimal learning curve.
* Manage machines quickly and in parallel.
* Avoid custom-agents and additional open ports, be agentless by
  leveraging the existing SSH daemon.
* Describe infrastructure in a language that is both machine and human
  friendly.
* Focus on security and easy auditability/review/rewriting of content.
* Manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any
  software.
* Allow module development in any dynamic language, not just Python.
* Be usable as non-root.
* Be the easiest IT automation system to use, ever.

## Use Ansible

You can install a released version of Ansible with `pip` or a package manager. See our
[installation guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) for details on installing Ansible
on a variety of platforms.

Power users and developers can run the `devel` branch, which has the latest
features and fixes, directly. Although it is reasonably stable, you are more likely to encounter
breaking changes when running the `devel` branch. We recommend getting involved
in the Ansible community if you want to run the `devel` branch.

## Communication

Join the Ansible forum to ask questions, get help, and interact with the
community.

* [Get Help](https://forum.ansible.com/c/help/6): Find help or share your Ansible knowledge to help others.
  Use tags to filter and subscribe to posts, such as the following:
  + Posts tagged with [ansible](https://forum.ansible.com/tag/ansible)
  + Posts tagged with [ansible-core](https://forum.ansible.com/tag/ansible-core)
  + Posts tagged with [playbook](https://forum.ansible.com/tag/playbook)
* [Social Spaces](https://forum.ansible.com/c/chat/4): Meet and interact with fellow enthusiasts.
* [News & Announcements](https://forum.ansible.com/c/news/5): Track project-wide announcements including social events.
* [Bullhorn newsletter](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html#the-bullhorn): Get release announcements and important changes.

For more ways to get in touch, see [Communicating with the Ansible community](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html).

## Contribute to Ansible

* Check out the [Contributor's Guide](/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Read [Community Information](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community) for all
  kinds of ways to contribute to and interact with the project,
  including how to submit bug reports and code to Ansible.
* Submit a proposed code update through a pull request to the `devel` branch.
* Talk to us before making larger changes
  to avoid duplicate efforts. This not only helps everyone
  know what is going on, but it also helps save time and effort if we decide
  some changes are needed.

## Coding Guidelines

We document our Coding Guidelines in the [Developer Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/). We particularly suggest you review:

* [Contributing your module to Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_checklist.html)
* [Conventions, tips, and pitfalls](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_best_practices.html)

## Branch Info

* The `devel` branch corresponds to the release actively under development.
* The `stable-2.X` branches correspond to stable releases.
* Create a branch based on `devel` and set up a [dev environment](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_general.html#common-environment-setup) if you want to open a PR.
* See the [Ansible release and maintenance](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html) page for information about active branches.

## Roadmap

Based on team and community feedback, an initial roadmap will be published for a major or minor version (ex: 2.7, 2.8).
The [Ansible Roadmap page](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/roadmap/) details what is planned and how to influence the roadmap.

## Authors

Ansible was created by [Michael DeHaan](https://github.com/mpdehaan)
and has contributions from over 5000 users (and growing). Thanks everyone!
