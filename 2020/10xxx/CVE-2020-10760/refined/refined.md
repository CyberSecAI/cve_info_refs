Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a use-after-free flaw in the Samba AD DC LDAP server. Specifically, the issue arises when the server is used as a Global Catalog and processes LDAP queries that utilize either the `paged_results` or `VLV` (Virtual List View) controls. The code responsible for handling these controls does not properly retain control data alongside the request, leading to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. The server attempts to access freed memory due to the improper management of control data related to LDAP requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** A successful exploit can crash the Samba LDAP server, causing a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network by an authenticated LDAP user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid authenticated LDAP user of the Samba AD DC server.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the Samba server.
*   **LDAP Knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of LDAP controls, specifically paged_results and VLV.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Samba versions 4.5 and later, particularly when used as a Global Catalog.
*   Unsupported versions of Samba before 4.7 use a single process for LDAP servers, increasing the risk of impacting all clients during an exploit
*   All versions of Samba after 4.11 use a 'prefork' process model which means a crash will disrupt all connected clients and result in a service restart.
*   Red Hat notes that versions of samba shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 are not affected due to lack of support for samba as Active Directory Domain Controller.
*   Samba versions 4.10.17, 4.11.11, and 4.12.4 address this vulnerability.
