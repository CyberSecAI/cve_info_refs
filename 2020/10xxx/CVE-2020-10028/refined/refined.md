    "attack_vector": "A user space attacker can call these vulnerable syscalls with malformed arguments.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code in user space.",
	"additional_information": "This issue was fixed in multiple Zephyr versions including v1.14.2, v2.2.0, and a branch from v2.1.0. The issue was tracked under ZEPSEC-32."
