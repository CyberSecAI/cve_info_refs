# Mbed TLS

Mbed TLS

**Project implements cryptographic primitives, X.509 certificate manipulation and the SSL/TLS and DTLS protocols. The project provides reference implementation of [PSA Cryptography API Specification](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0086/b) by supporting the cryptographic operations via. PSA Crypto APIs. The project also supports the [PSA Cryptoprocessor driver interface Specification](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/blob/development/docs/proposed/psa-driver-interface.md) which defines an interface for cryptoprocessor drivers. The small code footprint makes the project suitable for embedded systems. It has many users, including TF-A, TF-M and OP-TEE.**

Debian Bug     : 941265 963159 972806 1002631

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in mbedtls, a
lightweight crypto and SSL/TLS library, which may allow attackers to obtain
sensitive information like the RSA private key or cause a denial of service
(application or server crash).

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.16.9-0~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mbedtls packages.

For the detailed security status of mbedtls please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/mbedtls>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
