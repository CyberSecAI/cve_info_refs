{
  "CVE-2020-10878": {
    "Description": "Perl before 5.30.3 has an integer overflow related to mishandling of a \"PL_regkind[OP(n)] == NOTHING\" situation. A crafted regular expression could lead to malformed bytecode with a possibility of instruction injection.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflows in the calculation of offsets between instructions for the regular expression engine.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Malfored bytecode",
      "Instruction injection"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could abuse this behavior to insert instructions into the compiled form of a Perl regular expression, leading to DoS.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted regular expression which triggers the integer overflow during compilation."
  }
