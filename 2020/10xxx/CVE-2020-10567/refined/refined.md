### Content from github.com_7dbe374a_20250119_110705.html:

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `ajax_calls.php` file in the "save_img" action does not validate the file extension of the "name" parameter, which allows uploading of php files to the server
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload, lack of input validation, and the ability to inject PHP code through EXIF data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious user can send a POST request to `ajax_calls.php?action=save_img` with a crafted image containing PHP code in its EXIF data, and specifying a ".php" extension in the "name" parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to access the file manager's `dialog.php` page to obtain a valid session, and then be able to send POST requests to `ajax_calls.php`. They also need to craft the malicious image with the PHP code in the EXIF data.

**Summary**:
