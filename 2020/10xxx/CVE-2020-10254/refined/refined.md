  "CVE-2020-10254": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2020-10254",
      "Description": "It was possible to access the preview-image of a password-protected public-link. The severity of the issue is reduced to low because the attacker needs to know the public-link hash and the original filename of the image."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of access control on the generation of preview images for password-protected public links.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper Access Control"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker who knows a public link hash and the original filename of an image can bypass password protection and access the preview image.",
      "Attack Vectors": "Attacker needs to know a valid public link hash and the filename of an existing image. Access to the preview is achieved via an http request.",
      "Required Capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the public-link hash and the original filename of the image."
    }
