Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-10750:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Jaeger application, when configured to use Kafka as a storage backend, was logging sensitive information (Kafka credentials) to the container's log files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Plaintext credentials for Kafka (including username and password) were being written to the log files, which could be accessed by users with read access to these files.
- Logging of sensitive data: The application was logging the entire configuration including credentials at the info level, which is the default log level.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality breach:** An attacker gaining access to the container logs could steal the Kafka credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the Kafka message broker and the data within.
- Depending on the permissions of the stolen credentials, the attacker may have read or write access to the Kafka broker, which could have significant impact.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with access to the container log files where Jaeger is running can read the credentials.
- The attack vector is local, as the attacker requires access to the file system where logs are stored.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have low-level privileges on the system or container where Jaeger is deployed to read the log files.
- No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Jaeger versions prior to 1.18.1
- The issue was located in the `plugin/storage/kafka/factory.go` file, where the Kafka producer configuration (including credentials) was being logged.
- The leaked credentials included both plaintext and potentially kerberos credentials, if used.
- The fix involved preventing the logging of the full configuration object which contains the credentials.
- The CVSS score is 5.5 and defined as Moderate severity, with the following metrics: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
- The EPSS score is 0.044%.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-200 and CWE-532.
