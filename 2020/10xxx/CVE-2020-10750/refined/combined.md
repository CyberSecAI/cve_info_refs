# Displaying verification statuses for all of your commits

You can enable vigilant mode for commit signature verification to mark all of your commits and tags with a signature verification status.

## In this article

* [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)
* [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)
## [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)

When you work locally on your computer, Git allows you to set the author of your changes and the identity of the committer. This, potentially, makes it difficult for other people to be confident that commits and tags you create were actually created by you. To help solve this problem you can sign your commits and tags. For more information, see [Signing commits](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) and [Signing tags](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-tags). GitHub marks signed commits and tags with a verification status.

By default commits and tags are marked "Verified" if they are signed with a GPG, SSH, or S/MIME key that was successfully verified. If a commit or tag has a signature that can't be verified by GitHub, we mark the commit or tag "Unverified." In all other cases no verification status is displayed.

However, you can give other users increased confidence in the identity attributed to your commits and tags by enabling vigilant mode in your GitHub settings. With vigilant mode enabled, all of your commits and tags are marked with one of three verification statuses:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Verified** | The commit is signed, the signature was successfully verified, and the committer is the only author who has enabled vigilant mode. |
| **Partially verified** | The commit is signed, and the signature was successfully verified, but the commit has an author who: a) is not the committer and b) has enabled vigilant mode. In this case, the commit signature doesn't guarantee the consent of the author, so the commit is only partially verified. |
| **Unverified** | Any of the following is true:- The commit is signed but the signature could not be verified.- The commit is not signed and the committer has enabled vigilant mode.- The commit is not signed and an author has enabled vigilant mode. |

You should only enable vigilant mode if you sign all of your commits and tags and use an email address that is verified for your account on GitHub as your committer email address. After enabling this mode, any unsigned commits or tags that you generate locally and push to GitHub will be marked "Unverified."

You can check the verification status of your signed commits or tags on GitHub and view why your commit signatures might be unverified. For more information, see [Checking your commit and tag signature verification status](/en/authentication/troubleshooting-commit-signature-verification/checking-your-commit-and-tag-signature-verification-status).

## [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)

1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  **Settings**.
2. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  **SSH and GPG keys**.
3. Under "Vigilant mode," select **Flag unsigned commits as unverified**.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1838401#c0)  Mark Cooper    2020-05-21 05:04:15 UTC  ``` When using Kafka as a storage back-end, Jaeger before 1.18.1 writes plaintext and kerberos credentials to the container log files. A low privileged user could read the logs within the pod to discover the Kafka credentials as the information is disclosed as log-level info - which is the default.  References:  <https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/releases/tag/v1.18.1>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1838401#c2)  Mark Cooper    2020-05-21 05:24:17 UTC  ``` Looks like the issue is located here: <https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/e46f87376bdd2a28864864eb385ff49a6aa76330/plugin/storage/kafka/factory.go#L69>      // Initialize implements storage.Factory     func (f *Factory) Initialize(metricsFactory metrics.Factory, logger *zap.Logger) error { 	f.metricsFactory, f.logger = metricsFactory, logger 	logger.Info("Kafka factory", 		zap.Any("producer builder", f.Builder), 		zap.Any("topic", f.options.topic))  Logging f.Builder gets initialized a few lines before with f.options.Config which contains the credentials: <https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/e46f87376bdd2a28864864eb385ff49a6aa76330/plugin/storage/kafka/factory.go#L62>      // InitFromViper implements plugin.Configurable     func (f *Factory) InitFromViper(v *viper.Viper) {     	f.options.InitFromViper(v) 	f.Builder = &f.options.config     }  The log file then looks like: {"level":"info","ts":1590031704.5821817,"msg":"Kafka factory","producer builder":{"Brokers":["127.0.0.1:9092"],"RequiredAcks":1,"Compression":0,"CompressionLevel":0,"ProtocolVersion":"","BatchLinger":0,"BatchSize":0,"BatchMaxMessages":0,"Authentication":"none","Kerberos":{"ServiceName":"kafka","Realm":"","UseKeyTab":false,"Username":"","Password":"","ConfigPath":"/etc/krb5.conf","KeyTabPath":"/etc/security/kafka.keytab"},"TLS":{"Enabled":false,"CAPath":"","CertPath":"","KeyPath":"","ServerName":"","ClientCAPath":"","SkipHostVerify":false},"PlainText":{"UserName":"root","Password":"password"}},"topic":"jaeger-spans"}  So the issue isn't localized to just plain text auth but perhaps kerberos as well if used.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1838401#c3)  Mark Cooper    2020-05-21 07:25:17 UTC  ``` Whilst OpenShift ServiceMesh Jaeger does package the affected code (Kafka), the only supported storage backing is ElasticSearch. Additionally in the documentation/notes, only ElasticSearch is supported also - hence marking OSSM as affected but wontfix.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1838401#c4)  Mark Cooper    2020-05-21 11:59:39 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Carl Henrik Lunde (SpareBank 1)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1838401#c10)  RaTasha Tillery-Smith    2020-06-15 14:38:13 UTC  ``` Statement:  While OpenShift ServiceMesh Jaeger does package the affected code (Kafka), the only supported data store is ElasticSearch. Additionally, in the documentation and notes, only ElasticSearch is supported, marking OpenShift ServiceMesh as affected but WONTFIX.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1838401#c11)  Joshua Padman    2020-06-19 10:33:59 UTC  ``` Upstream release now available: <https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/releases/tag/v1.18.1>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1838401#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-06-19 16:20:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Jaeger-1.17  Via RHSA-2020:2636 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2636](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A2636)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1838401#c13)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-06-19 17:20:23 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
