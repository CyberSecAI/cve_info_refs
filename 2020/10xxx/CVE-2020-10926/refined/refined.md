- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of the firmware image before performing an upgrade.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient integrity check of firmware updates.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on affected NETGEAR R6700 routers.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent access; exploiting the firmware update mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device and does not need authentication. They also need to craft a malicious firmware image.
