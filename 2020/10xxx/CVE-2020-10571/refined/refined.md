Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2020-10571.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation when handling Run-Length Encoded (RLE) data within the `psd-tools` library. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the possibility of processing "broken" or "malicious" RLE data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input validation of RLE data.
- Potential for a crafted, malicious RLE input to cause issues

**Impact of exploitation:**
The provided text does not specify the exact impact of the vulnerability, but indicates it was serious enough to warrant a security fix. Based on the fixes "Add guard for broken rle data" and "add guard for malicious rle data", it's likely that the vulnerability could cause a crash, denial of service, or some other undesirable behavior due to the flawed RLE processing logic.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector would be through a maliciously crafted PSD file that contains specially crafted RLE data.
- A user would need to open or process this malicious PSD file using a vulnerable version of the `psd-tools` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need the ability to create or modify a PSD file containing the malicious RLE data.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network or machine as the victim. They simply need the victim to process their malicious PSD file.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.9.4 of the library, and users of versions 1.8.37, 1.8.38, 1.9.0, 1.9.1, 1.9.2, and 1.9.3 are advised to upgrade.
- The fix appears to involve adding guards to handle "broken" or "malicious" RLE data, preventing the problematic execution path.
- The vulnerability was addressed in pull request #198.
