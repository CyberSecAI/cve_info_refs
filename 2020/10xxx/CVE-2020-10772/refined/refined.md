Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10772:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-12662 in the version of Unbound shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. The initial fix, delivered in RHSA-2020:2414, did not fully address the query amplification issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Fix:** The primary weakness is the incomplete mitigation of the query amplification vulnerability. While the initial patch reduced the amplification ratio, it did not eliminate it.
*   **Query Amplification:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to amplify an incoming DNS query into a larger number of queries directed at a target.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can cause a denial of service by overwhelming a target with amplified DNS queries, potentially disrupting its normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **DNS Query:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted DNS queries to a vulnerable Unbound server.
*   **Amplification:** The vulnerable server then amplifies these queries into a significantly larger number of queries sent to the targeted victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to a vulnerable Unbound server to send the malicious queries.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and how to craft the queries to exploit it.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without needing any authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug report specifically mentions that the incomplete fix only affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and not the upstream versions of Unbound.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in RHSA-2020:2642 by providing a complete fix for the amplification issue.
*   The initial fix in RHSA-2020:2414 did reduce the amplification ratio, providing a slight improvement over completely unpatched versions of Unbound, but was not sufficient.
