The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities fixed in GitLab versions 12.9.1, 12.8.8, and 12.7.8. One of these vulnerabilities is related to CVE-2020-10980.

**CVE-2020-10980**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is a blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the FogBugz integration.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind SSRF
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially make requests to internal resources or external services from the GitLab server. While the response is not directly visible to the attacker (hence "blind"), the actions performed on the targeted server can have significant impact.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the FogBugz integration feature of GitLab.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to trigger the FogBugz integration feature in a way that would make the GitLab server send requests to a target chosen by the attacker.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description by specifying the vulnerable component (FogBugz integration) and clarifying the "blind" nature of the SSRF.
