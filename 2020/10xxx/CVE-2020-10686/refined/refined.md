Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10686:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Keycloak versions 8.0.2 and 9.0.0, where a user could register as themselves and then use the "remove devices" form to submit different credential IDs, potentially removing MFA devices of other users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The system does not properly validate the credential IDs being submitted through the "remove devices" form.
- **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The system does not verify if the user attempting to remove a device is the actual owner of that device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can potentially remove MFA devices for other users, preventing them from logging into their accounts. This disrupts services by locking legitimate users out.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the "remove devices" form in Keycloak's web interface.
- **Malicious User:**  A malicious user first registers with the system, and then exploits the vulnerability via the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Registered User:** The attacker must be a registered user in the Keycloak system.
- **Access to the "Remove Devices" Form:**  The attacker needs access to the Keycloak web interface and the "remove devices" functionality.
- **Knowledge of the API:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the device credential IDs being sent to the server through the remove device function.
