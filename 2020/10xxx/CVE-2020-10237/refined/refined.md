Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10237:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Froxlor creates temporary files during the installation process. Specifically, the installer creates a temporary file (`/tmp/userdata.inc.php`) and writes data to it before setting the appropriate permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The temporary file is created with default permissions (644 in the example, making it world-readable) before the desired permissions (0440) are applied. This creates a window of opportunity where the sensitive data within the file can be accessed by other users or processes on the system.
- **Information Exposure:** The content of the temporary file, likely containing user data or configuration details, is temporarily exposed due to the world-readable permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker with access to the system could read the temporary file and gain access to sensitive data such as user credentials, database configurations, or other confidential information.
- This information could be used to further compromise the system or other related services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where Froxlor is being installed or running to read the temporary file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where Froxlor is being installed, or an attacker that has already gained access to the system.
- They must have the ability to read files located in `/tmp`.
- The attacker needs to exploit this vulnerability during the short period between file creation and permission set during the installation process

**Additional Notes:**
- The bug report indicates that this vulnerability was present in the "current git master" and also in "froxlor in Factory".
- The report is marked as "RESOLVED WONTFIX" for SLE (SUSE Linux Enterprise), implying that no fix will be provided for that product.
- The reporter suggests setting proper file permissions **before** writing the file's content to prevent exposure.
