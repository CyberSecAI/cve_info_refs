  "CVE-2020-10769": {
    "description": "A buffer over-read flaw was found in RH kernel versions before 5.0 in crypto_authenc_extractkeys in crypto/authenc.c in the IPsec Cryptographic algorithm's module, authenc. When a payload longer than 4 bytes, and is not following 4-byte alignment boundary guidelines, it causes a buffer over-read threat, leading to a system crash. This flaw allows a local attacker with user privileges to cause a denial of service.",

    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer over-read"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The `crypto_authenc_extractkeys` function in the Linux kernel's IPsec authenc module does not correctly handle payloads that are longer than 4 bytes and not aligned to 4-byte boundaries. Specifically, when parsing a key formatted as an rtattr containing a 4-byte enckeylen, followed by an authentication key and an encryption key, the function underflows when calculating `keylen -= RTA_ALIGN(rta->rta_len)` if the rtattr's payload is longer than 4 bytes but not aligned to a 4-byte boundary, leading to a large value and subsequent buffer over-read.",
