Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10763:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Heketi logging sensitive information, specifically gluster-block volume passwords, during the creation of new block volumes. This occurred since the introduction of block volume support in Heketi v6.0.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  Heketi was exposing sensitive gluster-block volume password details within its logs. This allowed anyone with access to those logs to read the passwords.
- **Logging of Secrets:**  The core issue is that the application was writing secrets (passwords) to logs, which is a general security weakness.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker with local access to the Heketi server logs could read the exposed gluster-block volume passwords.
- **Potential Further Compromise:** The leaked passwords could then potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the storage volumes.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the Heketi server and its logs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires some level of access to the server where Heketi is running, sufficient to read the log files. This implies a compromised host or someone with administrative access to the machine.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in Heketi version 10.1.0.
- The vulnerability was present since the introduction of block volume support in Heketi v6.0.0.
- Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.5 for RHEL 7 and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.7 were also affected and have been patched.
- The issue is categorized as moderate severity with a CVSS score of 5.5 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
- The CWE associated with this vulnerability is CWE-532 (Information Exposure Through Log Files).
