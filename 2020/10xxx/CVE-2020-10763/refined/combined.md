| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1845387#c0)  Hardik Vyas    2020-06-09 05:49:45 UTC  ``` While requesting a new block volume creation, at Heketi we dump the sensitive gluster-block volumes PASSWORD details in the logs. This is a very old bug, starting from the introduction of block volume support to heketi-v6.0.0.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1845387#c1)  Hardik Vyas    2020-06-09 05:49:49 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Prasanna Kumar Kalever (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1845387#c2)  Hardik Vyas    2020-06-09 05:49:51 UTC  ``` Statement:  The version of heketi shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 does not filter out gluster-block volume passwords, hence affected by this vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1845387#c3)  Hardik Vyas    2020-06-09 05:49:53 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1845387#c8)  Jason Shepherd    2020-07-07 00:32:15 UTC  ``` OpenShift 3.11 uses heketi-v4.0.0-95-gaaf40619 which isn't affected by this issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Release 10.1.0

This is a security and bugfix release.

An information-disclosure flaw was found in the way Heketi logs sensitive

information. This flaw allows an attacker with access to the Heketi server logs

to read potentially sensitive information, such as the CHAP passwords for

gluster-block volumes ([CVE-2020-10763](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rm7c-x6gj-2mr8 "CVE-2020-10763")).

Administrators may want to check old logs for gluster-block passwords if they

created block volumes with CHAP authentication enabled. Restrict access or

remove old logs that retain the passwords.

Thanks to Prasanna Kumar Kalever of Red Hat for finding and fixing this issue.

## Changelog

* Fix [CVE-2020-10763](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rm7c-x6gj-2mr8 "CVE-2020-10763")
* Fix an issue removing/replacing devices on unrecoverable failed nodes
* Add a flag to skip a gluster heal check when gluster can not report on heals (when a node has failed or unable to perform the required action).
