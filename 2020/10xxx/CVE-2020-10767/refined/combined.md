| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1845867#c0)  Wade Mealing    2020-06-10 09:50:58 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of IBPB ( Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier  ).  The  IBPB mitigation will be disabled when STIBP is not available or when Enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) is available.    This is not expected behaviour and leave the system open to a spectre v2 style attack.  This can allow a local attacker to perform a spectre V2 style attack when this configuration is active.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1845867#c1)  Wade Mealing    2020-06-10 10:55:31 UTC  ``` This makes the CPU vulnerable to Spectre v2.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1845867#c5)  Wade Mealing    2020-06-11 08:15:32 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1845867#c10)  Wade Mealing    2020-06-16 09:57:42 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1847375](show_bug.cgi?id=1847375 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-10767 kernel: Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier is force-disabled when STIBP is unavailable or enhanced IBRS is available.

x86/speculation: Avoid force-disabling IBPB based on STIBP and enhanced IBRS.When STIBP is unavailable or enhanced IBRS is available, Linux
force-disables the IBPB mitigation of Spectre-BTB even when simultaneous
multithreading is disabled. While attempts to enable IBPB using
prctl(PR\_SET\_SPECULATION\_CTRL, PR\_SPEC\_INDIRECT\_BRANCH, ...) fail with
EPERM, the seccomp syscall (or its prctl(PR\_SET\_SECCOMP, ...) equivalent)
which are used e.g. by Chromium or OpenSSH succeed with no errors but the
application remains silently vulnerable to cross-process Spectre v2 attacks
(classical BTB poisoning). At the same time the SYSFS reporting
(/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre\_v2) displays that IBPB is
conditionally enabled when in fact it is unconditionally disabled.
STIBP is useful only when SMT is enabled. When SMT is disabled and STIBP is
unavailable, it makes no sense to force-disable also IBPB, because IBPB
protects against cross-process Spectre-BTB attacks regardless of the SMT
state. At the same time since missing STIBP was only observed on AMD CPUs,
AMD does not recommend using STIBP, but recommends using IBPB, so disabling
IBPB because of missing STIBP goes directly against AMD's advice:
https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/Architecture\_Guidelines\_Update\_Indirect\_Branch\_Control.pdf
Similarly, enhanced IBRS is designed to protect cross-core BTB poisoning
and BTB-poisoning attacks from user space against kernel (and
BTB-poisoning attacks from guest against hypervisor), it is not designed
to prevent cross-process (or cross-VM) BTB poisoning between processes (or
VMs) running on the same core. Therefore, even with enhanced IBRS it is
necessary to flush the BTB during context-switches, so there is no reason
to force disable IBPB when enhanced IBRS is available.
Enable the prctl control of IBPB even when STIBP is unavailable or enhanced
IBRS is available.
