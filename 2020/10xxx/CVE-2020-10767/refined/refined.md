Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10767:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Linux kernel's implementation of the Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier (IBPB) was flawed. It was being force-disabled when either the Single Thread Indirect Branch Prediction (STIBP) was unavailable or when Enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) was available. This behavior was incorrect and left the system vulnerable to Spectre v2 style attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect IBPB disabling:** The kernel was unnecessarily disabling IBPB when STIBP wasn't available or enhanced IBRS was present. This happened even when simultaneous multithreading (SMT) was disabled.
*   **Bypass of Mitigation:** Although attempts to enable IBPB using `prctl(PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL, PR_SPEC_INDIRECT_BRANCH, ...)` would fail with `EPERM`, using `seccomp` syscalls (or their `prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, ...)` equivalents), which are used by applications like Chromium or OpenSSH, would succeed without errors, leaving the applications silently vulnerable.
*   **Misleading SYSFS Reporting:** The `/sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2` file would incorrectly report IBPB as conditionally enabled, while it was unconditionally disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A local attacker could exploit this flaw to perform a Spectre v2-style attack. This could allow the attacker to leak sensitive information from other processes running on the same core. The primary impact is to confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local attacker:** The attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability
*   **Spectre v2 Style Attack:** The vulnerability allows for a Spectre v2 style attack. It does this by the attacker being able to poison the branch target buffer (BTB), leading to speculative execution, and potentially information disclosure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system.
*   **Knowledge of Spectre v2:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a Spectre v2 style attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Linux kernel version 5.8-rc1.
*   The fix involves enabling the prctl control of IBPB even when STIBP is unavailable or enhanced IBRS is available.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry includes links to the specific Red Hat errata that address the issue.
*   AMD does not recommend using STIBP, but recommends using IBPB, so disabling IBPB because of missing STIBP goes directly against AMD's advice.
*  Enhanced IBRS is designed to protect cross-core BTB poisoning and BTB-poisoning attacks from user space against kernel, not cross-process BTB poisoning.
