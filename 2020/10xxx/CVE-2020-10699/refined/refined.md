Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-10699:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `targetcli-fb` daemon, specifically the `targetclid` component, creates a socket file (`/var/run/targetclid.sock`) with world-writable permissions (0666) by default. This occurs because the systemd socket unit file lacks a `SocketMode` directive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The world-writable socket allows any local user to write to it.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** `targetclid` doesn't authenticate the source of commands received via the socket.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Unprivileged local users can send commands to the `targetclid` daemon, which runs as root, leading to privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A local attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.
*   Attackers can modify the iSCSI configuration.
*   The attacker can gain full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable `targetcli-fb` and `targetclid` are running.
*   **Socket Interaction:** The attacker writes commands directly to the world-writable socket (`/var/run/targetclid.sock`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a user account on the vulnerable system.
*   The attacker doesn't need any special privileges initially.
*   The `targetclid` service must be enabled, creating the vulnerable socket.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `targetclid` daemon is provided in `targetcli-fb` versions 2.1.50 and later, but it's disabled by default.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8.0, and 8.1 are not vulnerable because they do not include the vulnerable socket file. RHEL 8.2 is affected.
*   A patch was released to fix this issue by setting the correct permissions of 0600 to the socket file.
*   Mitigations include not enabling `targetclid` or manually changing the socket's permissions.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `targetcli-fb` version 2.1.53.
