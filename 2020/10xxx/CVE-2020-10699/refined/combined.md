| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1819219#c0)  Cedric Buissart    2020-03-31 13:44:30 UTC  ``` The targetclid daemon runs as root and provides a /var/run/targetclid.sock socket to which clients can write commands to and which it will execute on their behalf, so since the socket is world writeable any unprivileged user can write to it and targetclid will execute the commands even though the user is not privileged. Hence crosses a privilege boundary and so is a vulnerability.  Targetclid is provided on targetcli-fb versions 2.1.50 and newer. It is however disabled by default and is not required to be enabled for targetcli to work.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1819219#c5)  Cedric Buissart    2020-04-01 15:21:30 UTC  ``` Upstream fix : <https://github.com/open-iscsi/targetcli-fb/commit/6e4f39357a90a914d11bac21cc2d2b52c07c213d>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1819219#c8)  Cedric Buissart    2020-04-01 15:35:45 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  - Do not enable targetclid, this would prevent the socket to be created - Manually change the socket's permission every time it is being created : $ sudo chmod 0600 /var/run/targetclid.sock   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1819219#c9)  Cedric Buissart    2020-04-02 06:43:08 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://github.com/open-iscsi/targetcli-fb/issues/162>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1819219#c14)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-04-02 16:32:14 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-10699>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1819219#c16)  Cedric Buissart    2020-04-28 16:18:50 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 7, 8.0 and 8.1 are not vulnerable to this flaw, because they do not ship a version of targetcli that contains the targetclid.socket socket. Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8.2 is affected by this flaw. This issue did not affect the version of targetcli shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and 3, as the package did not include the support for systemd which provides targetclid.socket socket.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1819219#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-28 20:54:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:1933 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1933](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1933)   ``` |  |

## Description

![@alexmurray](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56540?u=ac4e9ffa7c37feced72e2bb27d16117c994e45b8&v=4&size=48)[alexmurray](https://github.com/alexmurray)opened [on Mar 23, 2020](https://github.com/open-iscsi/targetcli-fb/issues/162#issue-585933826)

The systemd socket unit fails to specify any `SocketMode` so the socket is world writable (0666) - as such any user can connect to it and send commands to targetclid without authentication. This is a likely a security vulnerability.

[targetcli-fb/systemd/targetclid.socket](https://github.com/open-iscsi/targetcli-fb/blob/23877ab4afbf0c2fe4092936261d92d7b7fbff11/systemd/targetclid.socket#L6)
