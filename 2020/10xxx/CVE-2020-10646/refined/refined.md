- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The buffer allocated to read data when parsing VPR files is too small, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to gain elevated privileges for remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attack via a crafted VPR file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and requires a low skill level to exploit. The vulnerability requires a user to be tricked into opening a malicious VPR file.
