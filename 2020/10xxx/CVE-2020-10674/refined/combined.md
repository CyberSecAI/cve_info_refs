Revision history for Perl extension PerlSpeak.

0.01  Sat Jan  6 21:58:49 2007
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-AX PerlSpeak

 1/9/2007 ver 0.03

 * Fixed error handling for opendir and readdir.

 * Added property tts_command => $string
    (insert "text_arg" where the text to speak should be.)

 * Added property no_dot_files => $boolean default is 1
    (Set to 0 to show hidden files)

 * Fixed bug in tts_engine => "cepstral" (previously misspelled as cepstrel)

 * Added funtionality to traverse directory tree up as well as down.
    (user can now use the arrow keys for browsing and selecting
    up and down browses files in current directory. Right selects the
    file or directory. Left moves up one directory like "cd ..")

 * Added property hide_extentions => $boolean to turn off speaking of file
    extensions with the filepicker method. Default is 0.
    (NOTE: If hiding extensions the no_dot_files property must be set to 1)

 * Added property "make_readable" which takes a regular expression as an argument.
    PerlSpeak.pm substitues a space for characters that match expression.  The
    default is "[_\\]" which substitutes a space for "\" and "_".

 1/20/2007 ver 0.50

 * Added funtionality for reading a text file. Method "say" will now take
    text or a file name as an argument. Also added method "readfile" which
    takes a file name as an argument. The property tts_file_command was also
    added to accomodate tts systems other than festival or cepstral.

 * Added funtionality for converting a text file to a wave file via the
    "file2wave" method and optionally the "file2wave_command" property.

 * Added properties "file_prefix" and "dir_prefix" to enable changing
    text to speak prior to file and directory names in the "filepicker"
    and "dirpicker" methods.

 * Added "browsable", a boolean property which will togle the browsable feature
    of the "filepicker" method.

 * Added "dir_return", a boolean property which will allows the "filepicker"
    method to return the path to a directory as well as the path to a file.

 * Changed required version of perl to 5.6. I see no reason why PerlSpeak.pm
    should not work under perl 5.6, however, this has not yet been tested. If
    you have problems with PerlSpeak on your version of perl let me know.

1/24/2007 ver 0.51

 * Fixed errors in documentation

 6/17/2007 ver 1.0

 * Fixed error message 'cannot stat filename' when making a cal to say()

 10/10/2007 ver 1.5

  * Added boolean property echo_off to turn off printing of text said to screen.

  * Added method menu_list(@list) Returns element of @list selected by user.

  * Added method getString() Returns a string speaking each character as you
    type. Also handles backspaces.

  * Added method conirm(). Returns boolean. Prompts user to enter Y for yes
    or N for no.  Enter also returns true.

  * Added shortcuts to the menu() method. You can press the number of menu
    index or the letter of the first word in menu item to jump to that item.

 01/02/2008 ver 2.01

  * Added suport for festival_server, festival_pipe, and espeak text to speech
    engines. This includes several methods and properties such as voice, pitch
    volume, and rate.

  * Added method getType(filename) Returns mime type for filename.
