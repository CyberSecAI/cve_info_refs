  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the `dns_query_name` parameter of the `dns_query.cgi` script, which allows for command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary system commands can be executed on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a POST request to the `/dns_query.cgi` endpoint with a crafted `dns_query_name` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device after user authentication. The attacker needs to know the device's IP address."
