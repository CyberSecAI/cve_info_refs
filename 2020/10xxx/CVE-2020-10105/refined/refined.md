{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Zammad returns source code of static resources when submitting an OPTIONS request instead of a GET request.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Source code disclosure vulnerability",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Disclosure of source code allows an attacker to formulate more precise attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "Submitting an OPTIONS request to a static resource (e.g., /zammad/public/404.html).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP OPTIONS requests to the Zammad server."
