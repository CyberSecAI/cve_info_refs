The content is related to CVE-2020-10289.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the unsafe parsing of YAML values when an action message is processed, which allows for the creation of Python objects.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an unsafe YAML load, which allows an attacker to inject malicious YAML payloads that result in arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to local or remote code execution on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted action message containing a malicious YAML payload. The attack vector depends on user interaction and how the system processes action messages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to send a crafted action message to the vulnerable system. This could involve being on the same local network or exploiting a vulnerability that allows remote access or the ability to send messages to a system running the vulnerable code.
