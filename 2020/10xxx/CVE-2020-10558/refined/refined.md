Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-10558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper process separation within the Tesla Model 3's infotainment system. This allowed a vulnerability in the web browser to affect critical system functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is a DoS that could be triggered by a malicious webpage. The vulnerability is triggered by abusing the `pushState()` function within the chromium-based web browser.
*   **Lack of process isolation:** The web browser process shared essential background services with the rest of the interface, causing a system-wide crash when the browser was overloaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Touchscreen Interface Crash:** The primary impact was the freezing/crashing of the entire touchscreen interface of the Tesla Model 3.
*   **Loss of Critical Information/Functions**: This included disabling:
    *   Speedometer
    *   Web browser
    *   Climate controls
    *   Turn signal visuals and sounds
    *   Navigation
    *   Autopilot notifications
    *   Other miscellaneous functions displayed on the main screen.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:** The vulnerability was exploited by visiting a specially crafted web page within the vehicle's browser. This webpage abuses the `pushState()` function to overload the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Special Access Needed:** The attacker only needed to get the victim to visit a malicious web page using the vehicle's built-in web browser.
*   **Remote:** The attacker could be remote, with the only requirement being the victim opening a malicious link.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability was present in all Tesla Model 3 vehicles before software version 2020.4.10.
*   The vulnerability does NOT disable the physical driving ability of the vehicle, however it can disable important features such as the speedometer, indicators and safety notifications.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS score of 7.1 (High).
*   The fix involved improving process separation within the infotainment system.
