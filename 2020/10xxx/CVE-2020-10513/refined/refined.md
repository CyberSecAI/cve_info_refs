Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the CVE-2020-10513 vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an arbitrary read/write flaw within the firmware of a well-known Digital Video Recorder (DVR).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Arbitrary Read/Write:** The core issue is the ability to read and write any file within the device's filesystem. This indicates a lack of proper input validation or access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized file system access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can modify configuration files, leading to disruption of the device's normal operation, causing a denial-of-service condition.
-   **Command Injection:** Modification of configuration files can potentially enable command injection vulnerabilities.
-   **Complete Control:** By exploiting the arbitrary read/write vulnerability, an attacker can potentially gain complete control of the infected device.
-   **DDoS Attacks:** Attackers can leverage compromised devices to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The attack vector is through the network, leveraging the vulnerable firmware on the DVR device.
-   The specific method of exploiting the arbitrary read/write is not detailed, but it is likely an interface exposed by the DVR firmware.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   An attacker would need network access to the vulnerable DVR.
-   The attacker does not require credentials for the arbitrary read/write, but the document does not specify the mechanism to exploit the vulnerability.
-   The attacker needs to be able to modify configurations.

**Additional Details:**
-   The content states that over 10 million devices were potentially affected in Taiwan.
-   The vulnerability is present in firmware versions before 2020/02.
-   The vendor has released patches after receiving the report from CHT Security.
