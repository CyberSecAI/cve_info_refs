Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-10029:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content clearly references **CVE-2020-10029** in multiple locations, including:
    *   NetApp security advisory titles and body
    *   Red Hat Bugzilla entry
    *   SUSE Bugzilla entry
    *   OpenSUSE security update description
    *   Gentoo security advisory
    *   Ubuntu security notice

*   The description consistently states that the vulnerability relates to a stack corruption issue in the `glibc` library due to crafted input to trigonometric functions, specifically referencing `sinl`.

Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2020-10029.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**:
    *   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of input to 80-bit long double trigonometric functions (like `sinl`, `cosl`, `sincosl`, and `tanl`) within the GNU C Library (`glibc`). Specifically, when the input contains a non-canonical bit pattern (e.g. `0x5d414141414141410000` on x86), a stack buffer overflow can occur during range reduction.
    *   The issue arises from how the `__kernel_rem_pio2` function handles these crafted input values in the `ldbl-96` variant.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** A specially crafted long double input can cause a stack buffer overflow during range reduction.
    *   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The code doesn't properly validate input before range reduction, which leads to the overflow.
    *   **Incorrect Use of `atoi`**: In the `wordexp()` function the usage of `atoi` was causing issues and should have been `strtoul`.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
     *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most common impact is a crash of the application due to stack corruption. Some texts also mention a potential for arbitrary code execution.
     *   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While a direct exploit for arbitrary code execution is not explicitly detailed, the reports indicate it is a possibility due to memory corruption. Some reports indicate a potential for overwriting the return address with null bytes when stack protectors aren't enabled, which can lead to crashes, and make it difficult to control code execution.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
     *   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a local attacker who can control the input to the vulnerable function.
     *   **Remote Attack:** Some content implies that a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability in applications that are processing untrusted input.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to control the input to the affected trigonometric functions. Some cases include the ability to control the input buffer and size passed to `getcwd()` in a setuid program or when processing untrusted input via applications.
    *   For a successful exploit, an attacker needs to be able to pass crafted input to the vulnerable functions.  

**3. Additional Notes and Observations:**

*   **Affected Functions:** The vulnerability affects several functions that rely on `__ieee754_rem_pio2l`, including `cosl`, `sinl`, `sincosl` and `tanl`.
*   **Specific architectures affected:** x86 architectures, specifically x86-64 are mentioned. The vulnerable code is within `sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c`.
*   **Pseudo-zero Numbers:** The vulnerability is related to how `glibc` handles pseudo-zero and unnormal long double representations.
*   **Mitigation**:
    *   The fix involves detecting such pseudo-zero and unnormal numbers and returning `NaN` (Not a Number) instead of continuing range reduction.
    *   Use of stack protection mitigates some attack vectors but may not completely prevent DoS in all instances.
*   **Patches**: The fix has been included in `glibc` versions starting 2.32, with backports to earlier versions in various Linux distributions.
*   **NetApp Products:** The NetApp advisory lists several affected products and provides specific fixes for some of them.
*   **Distribution-Specific Information:** There are various bug reports, patch information, and update instructions across Fedora, SUSE and Ubuntu, showing how each distribution handled this vulnerability.
*   **Severity:** The severity is rated as medium by both NetApp and NVD. The SUSE advisory also lists a CVSS v3 score of 2.9, which implies a low severity.
*   **Exploitation Complexity:** The exploitation complexity is stated as low on the NetApp advisory (local access, low complexity) and as medium on the RedHat advisory, but some reports suggest that it may be difficult to exploit for arbitrary code execution, especially when stack protections are enabled.

In summary, CVE-2020-10029 is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in `glibc`'s long double trigonometric function handling, particularly when provided with invalid input. This could lead to a denial-of-service and potentially other impact. Patches have been released by various vendors, and specific mitigation guidance is available.
