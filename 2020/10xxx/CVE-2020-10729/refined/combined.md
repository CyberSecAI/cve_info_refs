## Description

![@richlv](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112888?u=251d6a1edc036e33955e53c8b975dcd9daf59db9&v=4&size=48)[richlv](https://github.com/richlv)opened [on Dec 21, 2017](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/34144#issue-283891152)
##### ISSUE TYPE

* Bug Report

##### COMPONENT NAME

lookups

##### ANSIBLE VERSION

```
2.3.0.0, 2.4.1.0

```
##### CONFIGURATION

no custom config

##### OS / ENVIRONMENT

Linux

##### SUMMARY

two consecutive facts from password lookup with same length get identical values.

separate tasks or different length result in different values, as expected.

##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE

```
- name: Set random passwords for clusters
  set_fact:
    password1: "{{ lookup('password', '/dev/null length=20') }}"
    password2: "{{ lookup('password', '/dev/null length=20') }}"
  delegate_to: localhost
  delegate_facts: True
- debug:
    msg: "{{hostvars['localhost'].password1}} {{hostvars['localhost'].password2}}"
```
##### EXPECTED RESULTS

two different values

##### ACTUAL RESULTS

two identical values

changing length for one of these, or using separate tasks, gives different values.

<http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_lookups.html#the-password-lookup> says "A special case is using /dev/null as a path. The password lookup will generate a new random password each time", thus the current behaviour is at least confusing and unexpected.

from irc :

```
<larsks> Richlv: Whatever is happening seems to be happening at a higher level than the password lookup plugin: as far as I can tell, it's only ever getting called once.

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1831089#c0)  Borja Tarraso    2020-05-04 15:54:13 UTC  ``` Ansible template caching generates identical values when consecutive facts are created from password lookup with same length. Values should be different to prevent generate same passwords for different fields which can be used for different services or configurations and avoid exposing all of them at once.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1831089#c1)  Borja Tarraso    2020-05-04 15:55:05 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/67429/>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1831089#c3)  Borja Tarraso    2020-05-04 16:33:39 UTC  ``` From Product Security perspective this vulnerability could expose a really wide set of services and configurations depending of end users usage. CVSS score could be from non-existing in case of not using more than one look up password to critical if all of them are generated, so depending of how many values are generated and where they are used. Later consequences after these values are leaked or guessed somehow could become critical. For this is reason we would consider a blocker any revert of the current solution even if this could affect performance, to avoid exposing end users in worst cases scenarios. Adverse behavioural changes or performance issues must be taken as bugs or enhancements separately.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1831089#c4)  Borja Tarraso    2020-05-05 02:14:36 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Rihards Olups   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1831089#c5)  Borja Tarraso    2020-05-05 06:21:05 UTC  ``` Fix included in the Ansible 2.9.6 release: [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:0784](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020%3A0784)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1831089#c6)  Borja Tarraso    2020-05-05 07:37:15 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/34144>   ``` |  |

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Ansible, a configuration
management, deployment and task execution system, which could result in
information disclosure or argument injection. In addition a race
condition in become_user was fixed.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.7+dfsg-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.

For the detailed security status of ansible please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ansible>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
