Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-10729:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause lies in Ansible's template caching mechanism. When using the `password` lookup plugin with the same length multiple times within the same task, Ansible caches the generated password. Due to this caching, subsequent calls with the same length return the same (cached) value instead of generating new random passwords as expected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Randomness:** The password lookup, when used multiple times with the same length in a single task, fails to generate new random values for each lookup, leading to the same value being reused.
*   **Caching Issue:** The Ansible template engine incorrectly caches the result of the password lookup based on length within a task, leading to unexpected reuse of the generated password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Multiple Passwords:**  If multiple password fields for different services or configurations are generated using the same length in the same Ansible task, all those services or configurations end up with the same password, effectively exposing them all at once.
*   **Increased Attack Surface:** The use of identical passwords across multiple systems significantly increases the attack surface as a compromised password exposes other systems.
*   **Potential for Critical Consequences:** If leaked or guessed, the consequences of having a single point of failure (identical password) across several resources could be severe, including unauthorized access to systems and/or data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access by guessing or obtaining the single shared password.
*   An attacker who gains access to one system due to the shared password can use this access to compromise other systems using the same compromised password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not necessarily need any special position; they just need to find the identical password.
*   The attacker can be internal or external, the impact is on the overall infrastructure.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found in Ansible versions 2.3.0.0 and 2.4.1.0
*   The fix was included in Ansible 2.9.6
*   The issue is caused by the caching behavior within the template engine that incorrectly caches the result of the password lookup
*   A pull request was created to fix the issue: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/67429/>

In summary, CVE-2020-10729 is due to an Ansible template caching issue, causing it to reuse a generated password value when the same password lookup with the same length is called multiple times in a single task. This can lead to multiple systems having the same password and thus increased security risks.
