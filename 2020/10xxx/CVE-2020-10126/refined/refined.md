- **Root cause of vulnerability**: NCR SelfServ ATMs running APTRA XFS 05.01.00 do not properly validate software updates for the BNA (Bunch Note Acceptor).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The ATM's update process during boot does not validate the signature of CAB archives containing software updates for the BNA, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious CAB archive on removable media. This is a lack of proper signature validation of software updates (CWE-305).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with physical access can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, potentially leading to full control of the ATM. Additionally, exploitation could facilitate deposit forgery, where the attacker manipulates the amount deposited, then makes a withdrawal for the artificially increased value, resulting in financial loss.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the internal components of the ATM, including the host computer and BNA, is required. The attacker must be able to restart the host computer and insert removable media containing a malicious CAB archive during the boot process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Physical access to the internal ATM components and the ability to restart the host computer and insert removable media.
