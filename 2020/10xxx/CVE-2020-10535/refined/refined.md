- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A soft email confirmation sign-up flow was enabled by default in GitLab version 12.8.0. This allowed users to sign up and access the instance for a 2-day grace period with an unconfirmed email address.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Bypassing email confirmation on sign-up, which could allow users to bypass domain restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to the GitLab instance potentially bypassing domain restrictions.
- **Attack vectors:**  Users could sign up with an unconfirmed email address and gain access to the GitLab instance.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to access the GitLab sign-up page and create an account.
