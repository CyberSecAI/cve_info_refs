Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-10045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   An error exists in the challenge-response procedure used for authentication in the web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The flaw allows an attacker to circumvent the intended authentication process.
*   **Replay Attack:** The specific vulnerability is due to the ability to replay captured authentication traffic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain access to protected areas of the web application that should require authentication.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** There is a potential for unauthorized access to confidential information (low impact).
*   **Integrity Breach:** There is a potential for unauthorized modification of data or configurations (high impact).
*   **Availability Impact:** There is a potential for disruption of services (high impact).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed over the network.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack likely:** Although not explicitly stated, the description implies that the attacker needs to intercept and replay the traffic. This suggests a MitM or similar type of attack.
*   **Web application specific:**  The vulnerability is present in the web interface of the affected devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic to capture the authentication data.
*   **No special privileges needed**: An attacker does not need any credentials.
*   **User interaction needed**: An attacker requires user interaction (UI:R) as they need to capture the user's authentication attempt to replay it.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory notes that the firmware updates introduce authentication to the web application, which should mitigate this and related vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability is present in SICAM MMU, SICAM T and SICAM SGU products.
