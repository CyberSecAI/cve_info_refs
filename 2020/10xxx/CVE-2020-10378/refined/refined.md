  "CVE-2020-10378": {
    "description": "In `libImaging/PcxDecode.c` in Pillow before 7.1.0, an out-of-bounds read can occur when reading PCX files where `state->shuffle` is instructed to read beyond `state->buffer`.",
    "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds read in `libImaging/PcxDecode.c` occurs due to incorrect bounds checking when processing PCX files, specifically when `state->shuffle` reads beyond the allocated `state->buffer`.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially cause Pillow to crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted PCX image file."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to trick a user or automated system into opening a malicious PCX file"
    ],
    "details": "The vulnerability arises in `libImaging/PcxDecode.c` where an out-of-bounds read can occur when handling PCX files.  Specifically when `state->shuffle` attempts to read beyond the boundaries of `state->buffer`. The issue is in how the code calculates the read offset when handling the shuffle operation during PCX decoding. If this offset is incorrect, it can lead to the program trying to read from a memory location beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer."
