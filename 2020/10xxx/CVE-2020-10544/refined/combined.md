## Description

![@dgusoft](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18658082?v=4&size=48)[dgusoft](https://github.com/dgusoft)opened [on Mar 4, 2020](https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/5642#issue-575351426)
## 1) Environment

* PrimeFaces version: 7.0.11
* Does it work on the newest released PrimeFaces version? No
* Does it work on the newest sources in GitHub? No
* Affected browsers: all

## 2) Expected behavior

Proper escaping of title referenced by p:tooltip for .

## 3) Actual behavior

Target title not escaped in tooltip.js if this.cfg.target is set in tooltip.js.

## 4) Steps to reproduce

## 5) Sample XHTML

<p:inputText id="focus" title="This tooltip is displayed when input gets the focus<script>alert('xss');</script>" />

<p:tooltip id="toolTipFocus" for="focus" showEvent="focus" hideEvent="blur" />

## 6) Sample bean

## 7) Solution

This error was fixed for the bindGlobal function in tooltip.js with [#4394](https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/issues/4394). Same solution should be applied to Function bindTarget.

The line

this.cfg.escape = (this.cfg.escape === undefined) ? true : this.cfg.escape;

must be added at top of bindTarget.
