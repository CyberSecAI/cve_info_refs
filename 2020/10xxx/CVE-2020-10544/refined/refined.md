Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2020-10544.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper escaping of the title attribute when using the `p:tooltip` component in PrimeFaces. Specifically, the `bindTarget` function in `tooltip.js` does not properly escape the target title before rendering it within the tooltip.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the title attribute of an HTML element, which is then rendered by the tooltip component without proper sanitization. This results in the execution of the attacker's script in the context of the user's browser.
- Insufficient Output Sanitization: The `tooltip.js` file does not escape the title attribute, which leads to the XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser. This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking and cookie theft.
  - Data theft or manipulation.
  - Defacement of the web page.
  - Redirection to malicious websites.
  - Other malicious activities within the user's context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code within the title attribute of an HTML element, which is then targeted by a `p:tooltip` component.
- This is a client-side attack, meaning that the malicious script is executed within the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the title attribute of the HTML element targeted by the `p:tooltip`. This might be through various input vectors within the web application.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the server. The exploit occurs client-side within the victim's browser.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects PrimeFaces versions 7.0.11 and earlier.
- The issue was fixed for the `bindGlobal` function in `tooltip.js` previously, and the same fix should be applied to `bindTarget` function.
- The suggested fix involves adding the line `this.cfg.escape = (this.cfg.escape === undefined) ? true : this.cfg.escape;` at the top of the `bindTarget` function in `tooltip.js`.
