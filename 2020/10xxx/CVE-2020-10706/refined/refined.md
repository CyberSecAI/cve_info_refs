Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10706:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- OAuth tokens were not encrypted when the "encryption at rest" feature was enabled in OpenShift Container Platform. Specifically, the `OAuthAccessToken` and `OAuthAuthorizeToken` resources in the `auth.openshift.io` API group were affected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Encryption:**  OAuth tokens were stored in an unencrypted form, even when the data at rest encryption was activated.
- **Exposure via Backups:**  This vulnerability is exposed through backups of the OpenShift environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with access to a backup containing unencrypted OAuth tokens could use these tokens to log into the OpenShift cluster as any user who had recently authenticated via the web UI or command line.
- **Time-Limited Access:** The OAuth tokens are valid for a limited period (mentioned as 24 hours), so access is limited to that window.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Backups:**  The primary attack vector involves gaining access to backups of the OpenShift environment.
- **Data Exfiltration:**  An attacker needs to obtain access to the backup data, likely by exfiltrating the backup from the intended location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Backup Access:** The attacker needs access to backups of the OpenShift cluster's data. These backups are a likely target because keys are expected to be stored separately when encryption at rest is used.
- **OpenShift Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to use OAuth tokens to gain access to an OpenShift cluster.

**Additional Information:**

- **Mitigation:** Revoking leaked OAuth tokens through the OpenShift API is a possible mitigation if a vulnerable backup is made public.
- **Resolution:** The vulnerability is addressed in OpenShift Container Platform 4.6 GA release
- **Workaround:** Encrypting the entire backup disk using something like AWS KMS can mitigate this vulnerability.
- **Affected Components:** `OAuthAccessToken` and `OAuthAuthorizeToken` in the `auth.openshift.io` API group.
