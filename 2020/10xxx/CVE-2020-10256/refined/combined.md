# Automate provisioning in 1Password Business using SCIM

Learn how to integrate 1Password with your identity provider to automate provisioning.

![A diagram showing the connection of identity providers to 1Password SCIM Bridge to 1Password servers.](https://i.1password.com/media/scim/scim-diagram.png)

With [1Password Business](https://1password.com/business-security), you can automate many common administrative tasks by connecting your identity provider with your 1Password account using 1Password SCIM Bridge. When you set up automated provisioning with your identity provider, you can:

* Create users and groups, including automated account confirmation
* Grant and revoke access to groups
* Suspend users

Automated provisioning doesn’t include single sign-on (SSO). If you want to allow your users to sign in to 1Password using your identity provider, learn how to [set up Unlock with SSO](/sso/).

#### Read More

[Learn why you need to host your own SCIM bridge](https://blog.1password.com/1password-scim-bridge-explained/) to connect your identity provider to 1Password.

## Before you begin

Before you can set up automated provisioning, you’ll need:

* An [administrator](/groups/#administrators) in your 1Password Business account.
* Administrative access to a supported identity provider: Google Workspace, JumpCloud, Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, OneLogin, or Rippling.
* A platform to deploy 1Password SCIM Bridge on, such as Google Cloud Platform, DigitalOcean, or your own infrastructure (using the [1Password SCIM Bridge deployment examples](https://github.com/1Password/scim-examples)).
* A public DNS record to point to the location of your SCIM bridge. For example, `scim.example.com`. This is not required when you deploy to Azure Container Apps.

When you have these prerequisites, follow the steps below.

* [Set up 1Password SCIM Bridge](#step-1-set-up-and-deploy-1password-scim-bridge)
* [Set up managed groups](#step-2-optional-set-up-managed-groups)
* [Connect your identity provider](#step-3-connect-your-identity-provider)
## Step 1: Set up and deploy 1Password SCIM Bridge

Before you can start provisioning, you’ll need to set up and deploy 1Password SCIM Bridge:

1. [Sign in](https://start.1password.com) to your account on 1Password.com.
2. Click **[Integrations](https://start.1password.com/integrations/directory/)** in the sidebar.
3. Choose your identity provider from the User Provisioning section.
4. Follow the onscreen instructions to generate credentials for your SCIM bridge.
5. Deploy your SCIM bridge.
6. Optional: If you have existing custom groups, [set up managed groups](#step-2-optional-set-up-managed-groups).

You can also choose your identity provider from this list to get started on 1Password.com:

[![the Google Workspace logo](https://i.1password.com/media/google-workspace-small.png) Google Workspace](https://start.1password.com/integrations/provisioning?idp=google-workspace)

[![the JumpCloud logo](https://i.1password.com/media/buttons-and-icons/jumpcloud-logo-small.png) JumpCloud](https://start.1password.com/integrations/provisioning?idp=jumpcloud)

[![the Microsoft Entra ID logo](https://i.1password.com/media/buttons-and-icons/entra-id-small.png) Microsoft Entra ID](https://start.1password.com/integrations/provisioning?idp=azure)

[![the Okta logo](https://i.1password.com/media/okta-small.png) Okta](https://start.1password.com/integrations/provisioning?idp=okta)

[![the OneLogin logo](https://i.1password.com/media/onelogin-logomark.png) OneLogin](https://start.1password.com/integrations/provisioning?idp=onelogin)

[![the Rippling logo](https://i.1password.com/media/rippling-logomark.png) Rippling](https://start.1password.com/integrations/provisioning?idp=rippling)

If you see the details for an existing provisioning integration, youâll need to deactivate it first. Click **More Actions** and choose **Deactivate Provisioning**.

#### Important

The bearer token and `scimsession` file generated during setup can be used to access information from your 1Password account. Save these credentials in your 1Password account and **never share them with anyone** who shouldn’t have access to provisioning.

## Step 2 (Optional): Set up managed groups

If you have [custom groups](/custom-groups/) in your 1Password account, you can sync them with groups in your directory. After you’ve deployed the SCIM bridge:

1. Click **View Details** in the setup assistant or click **[Integrations](https://start.1password.com/integrations)** in the sidebar and choose **Manage**.
2. On the [provisioning details](https://start.1password.com/integrations/provisioning) page, click **Manage** in the Managed Groups section.
3. Select the groups you want to sync with your identity provider and click **Save**.

If youâve previously used the SCIM bridge, make sure to select any groups that were already synced with your identity provider. This will prevent problems syncing with your identity provider, including duplicate groups.

## Step 3: Connect your identity provider

To finish setting up automated user provisioning, connect your identity provider to the SCIM bridge. Learn how to connect your identity provider:

[![the Google Workspace logo](https://i.1password.com/media/google-workspace-small.png) Google Workspace](/scim-google-workspace/)

[![the JumpCloud logo](https://i.1password.com/media/buttons-and-icons/jumpcloud-logo-small.png) JumpCloud](/scim-jumpcloud/)

[![the Microsoft Entra ID logo](https://i.1password.com/media/buttons-and-icons/entra-id-small.png) Microsoft Entra ID](/scim-entra-id/)

[![the Okta logo](https://i.1password.com/media/okta-small.png) Okta](/scim-okta/)

[![the OneLogin logo](https://i.1password.com/media/onelogin-logomark.png) OneLogin](/scim-onelogin/)

[![the Rippling logo](https://i.1password.com/media/rippling-logomark.png) Rippling](/scim-rippling/)

## Get help

If your SCIM bridge goes offline or becomes unreachable, information between 1Password and your identity provider will stop syncing until it reconnects. Existing accounts and information won’t be affected. There’s no risk of data loss, even if you have to redeploy the SCIM bridge.

If you change a team member’s email address in your identity provider, 1Password will email the team member and ask them to accept the change. If youâre changing the domain of the email address, make sure to [update your allowed domains list](/scim-update-allowed-domains/).

Do not change a suspended team member’s email address. Some identity providers don’t sync email changes for suspended users. If you reactivate a suspended team member after changing their email address, the SCIM bridge will treat them as a new user.

# CVE-2020-10256 for all beta versions of the 1Password command-line tool and SCIM bridge released prior to December 24, 2018

Published: October 27, 2020

---

To see if you’re affected, go to <https://1password.com/cli-beta-check> and sign in to your account.
If you’re affected, you can update your account with a click.

---

## About the issue

An issue was discovered in early beta versions of the command-line tool prior to 0.5.5 and early beta versions of the SCIM bridge prior to 0.7.3. Both tools were using low-entropy random numbers when creating the following keys:

* Provisioned User keys
* Group keys
* Vault keys
* Document keys

The bug was discovered internally on December 24, 2018, and fixes for both tools were released the same day: command-line tool 0.5.5 and SCIM bridge 0.7.3. On February 4, 2019, the 1Password server was updated to prevent the use of affected versions of the tools.

In September 2020, we began to contact affected customers and provide a tool that replaces all affected keys. The issue affected 0.03% of 1Password accounts. We have no reason to believe that any data has been compromised.

This issue is listed under the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID [CVE-2020-10256](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10256).

## Who may be affected

The low-entropy encryption keys were only created by beta versions of the command-line tool and SCIM bridge released prior to December 24, 2018. You may be affected if you used:

* the 1Password command-line tool beta 0.5.4 or earlier
* the 1Password SCIM bridge beta 0.7.2 or earlier

## Recommended action

To see if you’re affected, go to <https://1password.com/cli-beta-check> and sign in to your account. If you’re affected, you can update your account with a click.

* **You may not be affected.** If the tool says you aren’t affected, you aren’t affected and no changes will be made to your account.
* **Your data is safe when you use the tool to update your account.** We’ve taken great care to guarantee data integrity throughout the process. Additionally, because there would be no security benefit to generating new keys for unaffected data, the tool will only regenerate keys for affected data.
* **You may need to notify your team.** If you’re an account owner, the tool will provide a list of team members that also need to run the tool. When a team member uses the tool, it will update their Employee vault if necessary, and any files within it.

## Impact and exploitability

The bug affected the creation of symmetric keys, but not the use of existing symmetric keys. Users, groups, vaults, and Documents created on 1Password.com or in any other 1Password apps were not affected, even if you had one of the affected tools installed. For example, items added or modified by one of the affected clients would still be encrypted by a strong key if the vault was created elsewhere.

To exploit the weak keys, an attacker would need:

* **Access to the user’s encrypted 1Password data.** The data could be captured from either a user’s device or a 1Password server. An attacker who breaks TLS and captures data in transit would not acquire the data needed to exploit this bug.
* **Awareness of the bug.** This could be deduced by a careful analysis of generated keys.
* **Knowledge of which keys were affected.** This could be gained by attempting an attack on all symmetric keys, accessing 1Password server logs, or guessing at user behavior.

A malicious insider or someone who compromises us might be in a position to have all three of those things, and therefore be able to crack a weak vault key and decrypt items in that vault, for example.

## Commentary

The command-line tool was initially conceived and developed as a proof of concept. Systematic static analysis, which uncovered the bug, was not introduced until after the tool was released in beta. Because the SCIM bridge shares code with the command-line tool, it was also affected.

When the bug was discovered, we were already restructuring how client code development is managed, and the discovery of the bug affirmed our decision to enforce static code analysis across every team and project. We’ve always highly restricted internal access â even to user-encrypted data. In this specific instance, we also limited awareness of the bug to those who needed to address it. After we analyzed the impact of the bug, we developed a tool to allow 1Password customers to determine whether they’re affected by the bug and easily replace all affected keys.

Automated testing and enforcement of secure coding practices is essential. The bug was discovered through static analysis of the command-line tool source, which looks for, among other things, the use of insecure random number generators. If we had automated static analysis in place at the time, the bug would have been identified and fixed before the beta release.

The 1Password security team, which bears ultimate responsibility, has increased its staff and introduced more formal mechanisms for monitoring and assisting development teams. The security team is continuing to make regular improvements in this area.
