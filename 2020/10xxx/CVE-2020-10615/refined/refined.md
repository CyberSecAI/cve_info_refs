- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length, stack-based buffer when handling opcodes for `GET_FILE_INFO`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Triangle Microworks SCADA Data Gateway with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Network, specifically via DNP3 protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to send a crafted `GET_FILE_INFO` request to trigger the overflow. Authentication is not required.
