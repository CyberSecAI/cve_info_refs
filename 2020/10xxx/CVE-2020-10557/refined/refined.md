Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-10557:

**Vulnerability Description:**

The provided text from the `README.md` file describes a vulnerability in AContent v1.4 related to improper handling of dangerous file extensions. Specifically, the default installation does not include `.php7` and `.phtml` extensions in the "Illegal File Extensions" list within the admin panel.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the insufficient validation and filtering of file extensions uploaded through the web application. The application allows users to upload files with extensions that can be interpreted and executed by the web server (e.g. `.php7`, `.phtml`), because they are not blocked by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate File Extension Filtering:** The application fails to properly restrict the types of files that can be uploaded by users, allowing the upload of potentially dangerous file types.
*   **Default Configuration Weakness:** The default configuration does not include common PHP-related extensions in the list of disallowed extensions.
*   **Open Registration:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by the web application's open registration, allowing any user to register and exploit the flaw.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The file manager page allows users to upload files without adequate security checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious web shell (a script that can execute commands) with the allowed extensions, an attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the web server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Server Takeover:**  Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain complete control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Application File Upload:** The primary attack vector is the file upload functionality within the AContent web application's file manager, which is accessible to registered users.
*   **Malicious File Upload:** The attacker uploads a crafted malicious file, such as a web shell, with a `.php7` or `.phtml` extension.
*   **Web Shell Execution:** Once the file is uploaded, the attacker can access the file via a web browser, causing the server to execute the malicious code and allow remote control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the AContent web application.
*   **Web Access:** The attacker needs access to the web application's file manager and the ability to browse to the uploaded file.
*  **Knowledge of Vulnerable Extension:** The attacker needs to know that `.php7` and `.phtml` extensions are not blocked in order to exploit the vulnerability by using these.
