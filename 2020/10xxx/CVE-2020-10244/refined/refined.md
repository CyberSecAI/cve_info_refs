Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-10244

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of weak hashing algorithms in the `jpaseto` library when generating v2.local tokens.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Weak hashing algorithms were used in the generation of v2.local tokens. This makes the tokens vulnerable to attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The use of weak hashing algorithms could allow an attacker to potentially forge or manipulate tokens, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other security breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could exploit the weak hash to compromise the integrity and authenticity of tokens, allowing for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to access or intercept v2.local tokens.
- An attacker also needs to have the knowledge and capability to break the weak hashing algorithm.
