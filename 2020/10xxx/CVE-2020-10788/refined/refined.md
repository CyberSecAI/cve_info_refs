Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10788:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a static, pre-defined key for the WebSocket server across all openITCOCKPIT installations. This means that every instance of openITCOCKPIT used the same key, instead of a unique, randomly generated one per installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Static WebSocket Key:** The primary weakness is the shared, static key used to secure WebSocket connections. This violates a fundamental security principle of using unique keys for each instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** By knowing the static key, an attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to the WebSocket server. The specific actions available to an attacker through the WebSocket connection is not mentioned in the provided text.
- The impact is listed as "High" in the provided blog post.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the openITCOCKPIT instance.
- **Knowledge of Static Key:** An attacker needs to obtain the static WebSocket key. Since the key is the same for all installations, obtaining it from a single system allows access to others.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to reach the openITCOCKPIT instance over the network.
- **Knowledge of the Static Key:** The attacker must know or be able to discover the static WebSocket key. The blog post indicates this is a vulnerability that has been reported, meaning the key was publically known, or could be easily guessed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content mentions that the vulnerability is resolved in openITCOCKPIT version 3.7.3, where a fix was implemented that generates a random API key for WebSocket connections. The provided commit from github (581cc90) implements the fix of generating a random key in the `app/SETUP.sh` file during installation.
- The provided content also provides steps on how to manually regenerate a new key if users are unable to upgrade to the latest version.
- The static key issue is described as being "High" impact.
