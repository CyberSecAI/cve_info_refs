Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the way C-MORE HMI EA9 touch screen panels handle passwords. When transmitting passwords, the device encrypts them using a weak or recoverable format.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Weak cryptography is used for password encryption.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose credentials. This could potentially lead to further compromise of the system or related systems, though the advisory doesn't specify the impact beyond credential disclosure.
*  **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely and does not require authentication.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the network where the vulnerable HMI panel is located. No authentication is needed, indicating the attack can be launched without prior access.

The provided information gives a concise description of the vulnerability.
