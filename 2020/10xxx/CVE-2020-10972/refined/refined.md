Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10972:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the exposure of the administrator password in cleartext within the HTML source code of a specific web page (`live_?.shtml`).
*   This page is accessible without any authentication, making the password readily available to anyone who can access the router's web interface.
*   The page uses a local variable to store the current password, which is populated by a command that outputs the password in plaintext every time the page is loaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Credentials:** The most significant vulnerability is storing the administrator's password in plain text within a web page's source code.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerable page can be accessed without any authentication, meaning no login or session is required.
*   **Insecure Permissions:** The page should not expose sensitive information like this and has insecure permissions.
*   **Broken Authentication Logic:** The device has an authentication process, but it is not enforced on the vulnerable page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain the administrator's password, enabling them to fully compromise the router.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In conjunction with CVE-2020-10971, the disclosed password can be used to achieve remote code execution. Specifically, by using the password to establish a session and then make a POST request to `adm.cgi`, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Full System Compromise:** An attacker can gain full control of the router, allowing them to manipulate network settings, intercept traffic, or install malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access to Vulnerable Page:** An attacker can directly access the vulnerable `live_?.shtml` page via the router's web interface, without any need for prior authentication.
*   **Source Code Inspection:** The attacker must inspect the page's source code to find the `syspasswd` variable containing the password.
*  **Exploitation Chain** An attacker uses the exposed password to create a valid session, and then use the `adm.cgi` to execute commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable router or have remote access to it.
*   **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to access a web page and view its source code.
*   **No authentication needed:** The attacker does not need any prior login credentials or bypass any authentication methods

**Additional Technical Details**
*   The specific vulnerable page is in `/etc_ro/lighttpd/www/`.
*   The router is running a version of BusyBox and the telnet binary can be used to establish shell access, after obtaining admin credentials.
*   The page's vulnerable variable is populated by executing a command every time the page loads.
*   The `adm.cgi` endpoint does not properly verify if a POST request comes from an authenticated user. It only checks if a session exists, but not if the POST originated from the valid session.

In summary, CVE-2020-10972 describes a critical vulnerability where an administrator password is leaked in plain text on a page that requires no authentication, potentially allowing attackers to achieve remote code execution, especially when combined with the other vulnerability, CVE-2020-10971.
