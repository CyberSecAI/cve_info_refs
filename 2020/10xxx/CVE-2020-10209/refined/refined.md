The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities found in Amino set-top boxes (STBs), including CVE-2020-10209.

**CVE-2020-10209 - Command Injection in the CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP) registration**

*   **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of a URL within the CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP) registration process. Specifically, the STB processes a URL received from a CPEMGT server in a way that allows command injection.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The STB is vulnerable to command injection via a URL parameter within a request to the CPEMGT service. This occurs during the registration/configuration process when the device retrieves a configuration file URL.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the STB as root.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker can control the response from the CPEMGT server and inject a malicious URL containing shell commands. The STB will then execute the injected commands as part of its configuration process.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the HTTP POST request and response between the STB and the CPEMGT server, by setting up a rogue CPEMGT server or poisoning DNS records to redirect the STB's request to a controlled server.
