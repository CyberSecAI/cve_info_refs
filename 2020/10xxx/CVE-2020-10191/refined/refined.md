Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the comment field within the MunkiReport application. This allows an authenticated administrator to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an authenticated XSS issue. Specifically, a logged-in administrator can inject malicious JavaScript into a comment field.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to adequately sanitize or encode user input, specifically within the comment functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Extraction:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject JavaScript that can extract sensitive information from other logged-in administrators.
- **Session Hijacking:**  The injected JavaScript could potentially be used to steal session cookies, leading to session hijacking.
- **Account Compromise:** If an attacker gains access to an admin account, they could potentially compromise the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Comment Injection:** The attacker crafts a specific request containing malicious JavaScript within the comment field of a MunkiReport page.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker must have administrator privileges and be logged into MunkiReport.
- **Targeted User:** The malicious script will execute when another logged-in administrator views the comment containing the injected code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker must have valid administrator credentials for the MunkiReport application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to make requests to the MunkiReport server.

**Vulnerable Versions:**
- MunkiReport versions from 2.5.3 to 5.2.x are vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
- **Update MunkiReport:** The preferred method is to upgrade to the latest version.
- **Update Comment Module:** If a full update is not possible, updating the `comment` module to v2.2 may resolve the issue, but this is only possible if the server is running MunkiReport 4.3.0RC2 or higher
- **Disable Comment Module:** As a last resort, the comment module can be disabled by removing it from the `MODULES` setting in the server configuration.
