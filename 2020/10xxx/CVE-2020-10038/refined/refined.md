- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to missing authentication for critical functions in the web server of the affected devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute administrative commands without authentication, leading to a complete compromise of the device. This could include unauthorized configuration changes, data manipulation, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks are possible by accessing the device's web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have network access to the device's web server. No prior authentication is required.
