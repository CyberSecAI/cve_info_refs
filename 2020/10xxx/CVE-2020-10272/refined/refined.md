The content is related to CVE-2020-10272.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that MiR robots, like MiR100 and MiR200, use default Robot Operating System (ROS) packages that expose the computational graph without any authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of authentication mechanisms on the ROS computational graph.
- Usage of default ROS packages that expose the computational graph without security measures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers with access to the internal wired or wireless network can take control of the robot.
- In combination with CVE-2020-10269 and CVE-2020-10271, malicious actors can command the robot as desired.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to the internal wireless or wired network of the robot.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the robot's network.
- The attacker requires knowledge of ROS to interact with the exposed computational graph.

**Additional details:**
- The affected systems include MiR100 (versions 2.8.1.1 and before), MiR200, MiR250, MiR500, MiR1000, ER200, ER-Lite, ER-Flex, ER-One, and UVD robots.
- The vulnerability is located within the platform code, specifically related to the ROS application and its cognition subsystem.
- The vulnerability has a high severity with a RVSS score of 8.0 and a CVSS score of 10.0.
- The issue was detected via dynamic testing with a tool called "alurity".
- The provided exploitation recipe involves setting up a network, a target robot container (mir100), and an attacker container, followed by a series of ROS commands to stop the robot mission.
