Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-10548:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `$searchColumn` parameter in the `www/devices.inc.php` file. This parameter is directly incorporated into a SQL query without any escaping or use of prepared statements, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a classic SQL injection vulnerability. The unsanitized `$searchColumn` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable `devices.inc.php` file can be accessed without authentication, allowing attackers to exploit the SQL injection without needing valid credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database, including device names, IP addresses, usernames, passwords, and enable passwords. This data could then be used for further attacks.
*   **Full Database Access:** Through SQL injection, an attacker could gain complete access to the database, potentially modifying or deleting data, or gaining access to other stored credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `devices.inc.php` file. The attacker manipulates the `searchColumn` parameter within the URL to inject SQL code.
    ```
    /devices.inc.php?search=True&searchField=antani'+SQL_Injection_Payload&searchColumn=n.id&searchOption=contains
    ```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable rConfig instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication. This means any attacker with network access to the vulnerable server could exploit it.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided exploit script `CVE-2020-10548.py` demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting a SQL union to extract the database name and then dumping the content of the "nodes" table, containing device connection information.
*   The exploit code also demonstrates the chaining of SQL injection vulnerabilities, highlighting how the flaws in the PDO DB Class allowed for stacked queries, potentially enabling authentication bypass through new user creation. This was a concept also used by v1k1ngfr in his exploit for CVE-2020-10220, which is mentioned as a similar exploit.
*   The blog post from theguly provides additional context about the full set of vulnerabilities found in rConfig 3.9.4 and details the steps taken to discover the vulnerability.
*   The blog post also highlights that the vulnerability was fixed in rConfig version 3.9.7.

This information provides a good understanding of CVE-2020-10548, its root cause, impact, and how it can be exploited.
