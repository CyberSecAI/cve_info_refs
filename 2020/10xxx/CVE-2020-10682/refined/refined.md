The provided content is related to CVE-2020-10682.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to upload a crafted file with a `.jpegd` extension which bypasses the file type restrictions. The server processes this file as a PHP file, enabling remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The system does not properly validate or sanitize uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload a file with a malicious extension.
- Insecure file handling: The server executes files with the `.jpegd` extension as PHP code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to:
- Full control over the web server
- Data breaches
- Website defacement
- Malware deployment
- Denial-of-service attacks

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed via a crafted POST request to the `/cmsms/admin/moduleinterface.php` endpoint
- The attacker uploads a file disguised as a JPG but containing malicious PHP code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the CMS Made Simple admin panel.
- The attacker must have the capability to upload files through the Filemanager.
