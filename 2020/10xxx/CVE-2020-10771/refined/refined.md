Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10771:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided documents explicitly mention "CVE-2020-10771 Infinispan Vulnerability" and its impact on NetApp products.  The Red Hat bugzilla entry is for "CVE-2020-10771" as well so it's clearly related.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a vulnerability in Infinispan version 10.  The vulnerability stems from the fact that actions that can modify data or have side effects could be triggered through HTTP GET requests in the REST API.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper HTTP Method Usage:** The REST API allows actions that should use POST, PUT, or DELETE to be triggered with GET requests. This violates RESTful principles and opens the door for CSRF attacks.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is that the improper use of GET requests for actions makes the application susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, which can allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Modification:** An attacker could modify or add data by crafting malicious GET requests, leveraging the insecure design.
*  **Sensitive Information Disclosure**: The vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could disrupt services by leveraging the insecure actions, also through GET requests, potentially leading to a DoS.
*   **Unauthorized actions:** An attacker could use crafted GET requests to trigger actions such as cancelling or starting backups.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** An attacker would exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious GET requests sent over the network.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious website, email, or other communication to trick a user into triggering a GET request that would execute an action on the vulnerable system

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Social Engineering (for CSRF):** For CSRF attack, the attacker needs to trick a legitimate user into initiating a request against the vulnerable system.
*   **No Authentication required for the Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is triggered by using a GET request to perform functions that should not be performed using a GET request, hence authentication is not needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically present in Infinispan version 10
*   NetApp is aware of public discussion regarding this vulnerability.
*   NetApp has released a fix for the vulnerability in OnCommand Insight via a patch
*   NetApp states that the vulnerability was fixed in Red Hat Data Grid 8.2.0 via RHSA-2021:2139.
*   A list of vulnerable and non-vulnerable products is listed, with only "OnCommand Insight" identified as vulnerable.
