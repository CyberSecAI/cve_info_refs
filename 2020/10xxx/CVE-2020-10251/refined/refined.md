The provided content relates to CVE-2020-10251.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read in the `ReadHEICImageByID()` function within `coders\heic.c`. This occurs when processing an HEIC image where the declared width or height in pixels exceeds the actual physical size of the image.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- Lack of proper bounds checking when reading image data in the `ReadHEICImageByID()` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash of the application due to access violation.
- Potential for denial-of-service.
- Possible information disclosure, although not explicitly mentioned.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted HEIC image file.
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious HEIC file to ImageMagick for processing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide a crafted HEIC file to the system running ImageMagick.
- No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability other than to execute ImageMagick with a crafted file.
