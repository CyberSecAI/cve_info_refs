Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Acronis True Image 2021 includes an OpenSSL component that uses an `OPENSSLDIR` variable pointing to a subdirectory within `C:\jenkins_agent\`.
*   A privileged service within Acronis True Image utilizes this OpenSSL component.
*   Unprivileged Windows users can create subdirectories off the system root (e.g., `C:\`). This allows an attacker to create the necessary path to a malicious `openssl.cnf` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Configuration:** The `OPENSSLDIR` variable is set to a location under `C:\jenkins_agent\`, which is not a protected system directory.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** Unprivileged users can create directories and files under the system root.
*   **DLL Search Order Hijacking:** Although not explicitly stated, the vulnerability relies on the ability to influence the loading of the OpenSSL configuration, which is similar to DLL hijacking by leveraging a misconfigured path variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By placing a specially crafted `openssl.cnf` file in the directory specified by the `OPENSSLDIR` variable, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged user can gain SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker creates the required directory structure and places a malicious `openssl.cnf` file in the path specified by `OPENSSLDIR`.
*   **Configuration Hijacking:** By controlling the `openssl.cnf` file, an attacker can influence the behavior of the OpenSSL component and execute code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires the ability to create directories and files on the local Windows system where Acronis True Image is installed.
*   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker can be an unprivileged user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is related to the concept of DLL search order hijacking, as referenced in the provided content.
*   The `openssl.cnf` is a configuration file that is being hijacked rather than a DLL.
* The vulnerability is fixed in Acronis True Image 2021 build 32010.
