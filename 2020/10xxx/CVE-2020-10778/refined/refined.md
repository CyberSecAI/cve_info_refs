Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a business logic flaw in Red Hat CloudForms. Specifically, read-only widgets could be edited by manipulating the HTML form.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of server-side validation: The application does not properly validate the read-only status of widget fields on the server side.
- Client-side control: The application relies on the "disabled" attribute in HTML to prevent modifications, which can be easily bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with low privileges could alter read-only values of widgets, bypassing intended server-side validation and potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the manipulation of the HTML form in the client-side (e.g. a web browser).
- The attacker needs to inspect the HTML elements of the form and remove the `disabled` attribute from the fields that are intended to be read-only.
- By removing the disabled attribute, the attacker can change the values of the form and submit them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low-privileged user: The attacker needs to have low-level access to the CloudForms application to view and manipulate the form.
- Basic web development knowledge: The attacker needs to be able to use browser developer tools or equivalent to inspect the HTML and modify attributes.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found in Red Hat CloudForms versions 4.7 and 5.
- The vulnerability was addressed in CloudForms Management Engine versions 5.11.7.1, 5.11 and 5.10 via RHSA-2020:3358 and RHSA-2020:3574 respectively.
