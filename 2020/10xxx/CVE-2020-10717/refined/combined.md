Subject: CVE-2020-10717 QEMU: virtiofsd: guest may open maximum file descriptor
 to cause DoS

   Hello,

A potential DoS issue was found in the virtio-fs shared file system daemon
(virtiofsd) implementation of the QEMU. Virtiofsd is meant to share a host
file system directory with a guest via virtio-fs device. The said DoS may
occur on the host, if the guest was to open the maximum number of file
descriptors under the shared directory. A guest user/process may use this flaw
to cause DoS issue on the host.

Upstream patch(es):

   -> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-05/msg00141.html>

This issue was reported by Yuval Avrahami of Palo Alto Networks.

Thank you.

## [PULL 2/6] virtiofsd: stay below fs.file-max sysctl value (CVE-2020-1071

| **Subject**: | [PULL 2/6] virtiofsd: stay below fs.file-max sysctl value (CVE-2020-10717) |
| **Date**: | Fri, 1 May 2020 20:14:56 +0100 |

```
From: Stefan Hajnoczi <address@hidden>

The system-wide fs.file-max sysctl value determines how many files can
be open.  It defaults to a value calculated based on the machine's RAM
size.  Previously virtiofsd would try to set RLIMIT_NOFILE to 1,000,000
and this allowed the FUSE client to exhaust the number of open files
system-wide on Linux hosts with less than 10 GB of RAM!

Take fs.file-max into account when choosing the default RLIMIT_NOFILE
value.

  virtiofsd: drop all capabilities in the wait parent process (2020-05-01
20:05:37 +0100)

----------------------------------------------------------------
virtiofsd: Pull 2020-05-01 (includes CVE fix)

This set includes a security fix, other fixes and improvements.

Security fix:
The security fix is for CVE-2020-10717 where, on low RAM hosts,
the guest can potentially exceed the maximum fd limit.
This fix adds some more configuration so that the user
can explicitly set the limit.
Thank you to Yuval Avrahami for reporting this.

Fixes:

Recursive mounting of the exported directory is now used in
the sandbox, such that if there was a mount underneath present at
the time the virtiofsd was started, that mount is also
visible to the guest; in the existing code, only mounts that
happened after startup were visible.

Security improvements:

The jailing for /proc/self/fd is improved - but it's something
that shouldn't be accessible anyway.

Most capabilities are now dropped at startup; again this shouldn't
change any behaviour but is extra protection.
