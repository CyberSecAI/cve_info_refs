Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10235:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure execution of the `mysqldump` command during the Froxlor installation process. Specifically, the `mysql_database` parameter provided by the user during installation was not properly sanitized before being included in the command executed by `exec()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By crafting a malicious value for the `mysql_database` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands into the `mysqldump` command string.
*   **Insecure use of `exec()`:** The use of the `exec()` function without proper sanitization of user-provided input allows for the execution of attacker-controlled commands on the server.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or escape user-provided parameters, particularly `mysql_database`, before incorporating them into a shell command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the webserver user (typically `wwwrun`).
*   **Full System Compromise:** With arbitrary code execution, an attacker can potentially gain full control of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP request to the Froxlor installation script (`install/install.php`). The attacker manipulates the `mysql_database` parameter within the request's data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Froxlor installation page.
*   **Froxlor Installation:** The attacker needs to interact with the Froxlor installation process.
*   **Knowledge of Froxlor Parameters:** The attacker needs knowledge of the expected parameters during Froxlor installation, specifically how `mysql_database` is used.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered if the database specified already exists which explains why the exploit must be done twice.
*   The fix involves using `escapeshellarg()` to sanitize the `mysql_database` and `mysql_root_pass` parameters before they are used in the `mysqldump` command.
*   The vulnerability was present in the Froxlor installer.
