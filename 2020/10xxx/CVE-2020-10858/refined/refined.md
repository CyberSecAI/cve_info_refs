Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10858:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause was a missing permission request handler in the Zulip desktop application. This lack of handling meant that the application could access the webcam and microphone without explicitly requesting permission from the user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission request handler for accessing webcam and microphone.
- Implicit access to sensitive hardware without explicit user consent.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized recording of audio and video using the user's webcam and microphone. This could lead to privacy breaches, surveillance, and potentially the capture of sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability exists within the Zulip desktop application. An attacker might exploit this through malicious code embedded within the application or possibly through other vulnerabilities that could lead to execution of unauthorized code in the context of the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to exploit the Zulip desktop application to execute arbitrary code. Since the vulnerability is in the desktop app, the attacker would likely have to compromise the application itself to trigger the unwanted recording of video and audio.
