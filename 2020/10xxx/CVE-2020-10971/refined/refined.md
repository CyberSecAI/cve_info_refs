Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-10971:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper session validation in the `adm.cgi` script of Wavlink devices. Specifically, when processing POST requests, the script does not verify if the request originates from a valid, active user session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Session Validation:** The primary weakness is the failure to validate the source of POST requests to `adm.cgi`. This allows an attacker to send arbitrary commands through a crafted POST request even if they are not authenticated.
- **Insecure Permissions:** The vulnerability is categorized as "Insecure Permissions."
- **Command Execution as Root**: The supplied command in the POST request is executed as root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the affected device with root privileges. This allows the attacker to take full control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted POST Request:** The attack vector is a specifically crafted POST request sent to the `adm.cgi` endpoint.
- **Network Access:** The attack can be performed remotely, requiring network access to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the device.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the vulnerable `adm.cgi` endpoint.
- **Active User Session:**  The attacker needs an active user session on the device, which can be either an existing legitimate session or one created using other related vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-10972, CVE-2020-10973, and CVE-2020-10974). The vulnerability can be exploited if an active session exists without validating the source of the POST request.

**Affected Devices:**
- The following Wavlink devices are listed as affected: Wavlink WN530HG4, Wavlink WN575A3, Wavlink WN579G3, Wavlink WN531G3, Wavlink WN533A8, Wavlink WN531A6, Wavlink WN551K1, Wavlink WN535G3, Wavlink WN530H4, Wavlink WN57X93, WN572HG3, Wavlink WN578A2, Wavlink WN579X3, and Jetstream AC3000/ERAC3000.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is made significantly easier to exploit because of other vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-10972, CVE-2020-10973, and CVE-2020-10974) that allow an attacker to obtain admin credentials and establish their own session. This eliminates the need to rely on a user being already logged in.
- The specific devices and their firmware versions mentioned are:
    - WL-WN579G3 - M79X3.V5030.180719
    - WL-WN575A3 - RPT75A3.V4300.180801
    - WL-WN530HG4 - M30HG4.V5030.191116
