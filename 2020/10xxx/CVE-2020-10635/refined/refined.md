### Summary:
The advisory discusses a vulnerability in KUKA.Sim Pro Version 3.1 simulation and machine-programming software related to the improper enforcement of message integrity during transmission in a communication channel. When the software requests a model, the server transmits the model in plaintext. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a loss of integrity in external 3D models fetched from remote servers. When tested on real machines, this effect is unpredictable.

### Technical Details:
*   **Vulnerability:** Improper Enforcement of Message Integrity During Transmission in a Communication Channel (CWE-924)
*   **Affected Product:** KUKA.Sim Pro Version 3.1
*   **Root Cause:** Simulation models are transmitted in plaintext.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker could potentially compromise the integrity of the 3D models transmitted from the server.
*   **Impact:** Loss of integrity in external 3D models fetched from remote servers.
*   **CVSS v3 Score:** 4.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade KUKA.Sim Pro to Version 3.1.2 or above. Minimize network exposure, isolate control system networks behind firewalls, and use secure remote access methods such as VPNs.
