Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-10208:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw within the EntoneWebEngine, specifically affecting the `/api/dial` endpoint. This endpoint saves the provided settings into the `sys_config.txt` file. By injecting newlines and escaped double quotes into the parameters of a PUT request to `/api/dial`, an attacker can insert arbitrary commands into the `sys_config.txt` file. This file is then sourced by shell scripts during boot, resulting in the injected commands being executed as root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the command injection flaw in the `/api/dial` endpoint of the EntoneWebEngine. The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
- **Unsanitized Input:**  The webserver does not properly sanitize the input received at the `/api/dial` endpoint before saving it to `sys_config.txt`. This file is then interpreted as a shell script, thus executing the injected commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the affected STB.
- **Full Device Control:** RCE enables the attacker to gain full control of the device, including accessing the filesystem, modifying settings, and potentially installing malicious software.
- **Network-Wide Impact:** Due to the nature of the IPTV network, where all devices are interconnected, a single compromised device can be used to compromise other STBs on the network.
- **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** Attackers can steal customer data such as customer numbers, IPTV passwords, and recording details. They can also manipulate recordings, add new ones, or delete existing ones.
- **Content Manipulation:** Attackers can change the channel, modify the volume, or stream their own content to the devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is through the IPTV network, where the STBs are interconnected.
- **HTTP PUT Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP PUT request to the vulnerable `/api/dial` endpoint of the EntoneWebEngine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same IPTV network as the targeted STBs or have a way to reach the network.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the command injection vulnerability in the `/api/dial` endpoint and how to exploit it by injecting newlines and escaped double quotes.
- **HTTP Communication:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the webserver running on the STB.

**Additional Details (from the provided content):**
- The vulnerability can be exploited even after a firmware update.
- The attacker can use the command injection vulnerability to install a reverse shell or modify the `/etc/shadow` file, which could facilitate further access.
- The injected commands are executed with root privileges.
- The `sys_config.txt` file is persistent across reboots, which means commands can be executed every boot.
- The author was able to stream their own content to devices via webserver once shell access was gained.
- The author could retrieve customer data from other devices and was able to impersonate any user.
