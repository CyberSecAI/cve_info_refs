Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-10384:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a local privilege escalation vulnerability present in the `mymbCONNECT24` and `mbCONNECT24` software.

**Weakness:**

*   **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):** The software allows a local attacker with access to the `www-data` account to escalate privileges to the `root` account.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain full control of the system by escalating from the `www-data` account to the `root` account, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system, starting with the compromised `www-data` account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have initial low-level access to the system via the `www-data` account, a common user for web servers.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of `mymbCONNECT24` and `mbCONNECT24` up to and including version 2.6.1
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.6.2 where "any known way to get to www-data" is closed.
*   A proper fix for the underlying issue will come with a future architectural core-system-update.
*   The CVSS v3.1 vector is `AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
