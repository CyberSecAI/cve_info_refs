- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Glassfish 4.1 server, which is part of the Epikur software, is running with its default configuration. This includes a default administrator account with no password set.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The lack of a password on the Glassfish administrator account allows unauthorized access to the server's administrative interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain access to the Glassfish serverâ€™s admin interface, potentially leading to unauthorized configuration changes, data access, and other malicious actions. The impact is rated as low for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Local network interface. An attacker needs to be on the local network to access the vulnerable port (TCP 4848).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable server, and no authentication is required to access the admin interface.
