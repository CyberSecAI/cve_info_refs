{
  "Root cause": "The Cinder driver for Dell EMC ScaleIO/VxFlex OS exposes the backend storage credentials in the connection_info element of the Block Storage v3 Attachments API calls.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper handling of credentials",
    "Exposure of sensitive information"
  ],
  "Impact": "An end user can retrieve the backend credentials from the API calls and use them to connect to other users volumes or the ScaleIO/VxFlex OS management API.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a volume, making an API call to show the attachment detail information, and retrieving a username and password.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user capable of creating a volume and making API calls."
