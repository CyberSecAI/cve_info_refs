< [OSSN](/wiki/OSSN "OSSN")

## Dell EMC ScaleIO/VxFlex OS Backend Credentials Exposure

### Summary

This vulnerability is present when using Cinder with a Dell EMC ScaleIO or VxFlex OS storage backend.

Note: The Dell EMC "ScaleIO" driver was rebranded as "VxFlex OS" in the Train release.

### Affected Services / Software

Cinder / Ocata, Pike, Queens, Rocky, Stein, Train, Ussuri

This vulnerability applies only when using a Dell EMC ScaleIO/VxFlexOS Backend with Cinder. Other drivers are not impacted.

### Discussion

When using Cinder with the Dell EMC ScaleIO or VxFlex OS backend storage driver, credentials for the entire backend are exposed in the ``connection\_info`` element in all Block Storage v3 Attachments API calls containing that element. This enables an end user to create a volume, make an API call to show the attachment detail information, and retrieve a username and password that may be used to connect to another user's volume. Additionally, these credentials are valid for the ScaleIO or VxFlex OS Management API, should an attacker discover the Management API endpoint.

This issue was reported by David Hill and Eric Harney of Red Hat.

### Recommended Actions

Remediation of this issue consists of the following:

1. Patching the ScaleIO or VxFlex OS Cinder driver so that it no longer provides the password to Cinder when a Block Storage v3 Attachments API response is constructed.

2. Patching the ScaleIO connector in the os-brick library so that it retrieves the password from a configuration file readable only by root. (Note: the connector was not rebranded; both ScaleIO and VxFlex OS backends use the 'scaleio' os-brick connector.)

3. Patching the ScaleIO os-brick privileged file that allows the scaleio connector to escalate privileges for specific operations; this is necessary to allow the connector process to access the configuration file that is readable only by root.

4. Deploying a configuration file containing the password (and replication password, if applicable) to all compute nodes, cinder nodes, and anywhere you would perform a volume attachment in your deployment.

To refresh database information, all volumes should be detached and reattached.

Because this remediation consists of deploying credentials in a root-readable-only file, it is not suitable for the use case of attaching a volume to a bare metal host. Thus, the Dell EMC ScaleIO/VxFlex OS storage backend for Cinder is \*not recommended\* for use with bare metal hosts.

Note: The Ocata, Pike, Queens, and Rocky branches of OpenStack are in the Extended Maintenance phase. Point releases are no longer made from these branches and security patches are produced only on a reasonable effort basis. Patches for Queens and Rocky are provided as a courtesy. Patches for Ocata and Pike are not available.

#### Patches

Both cinder and os-brick must be patched. Documentation is provided as part of the cinder patch concerning the new configuration file that must be deployed to all compute nodes, cinder nodes, and anywhere you would perform a volume attachment in your deployment.

NOTE (added 2020-06-18): The original patch for os-brick contained
a flaw [0] that prevented the scaleio connector from operating when run
under Python 2.7. Thus for OpenStack releases supporting Python 2.7
(that is, Train and earlier), a second os-brick patch is required and
is listed below. The list of available releases has also been updated
to address this issue.

Overview:

The OpenStack Security SIG actively works to improve OpenStack security through improvements to code, architecture and various documentation efforts including vulnerability management (through the Vulnerability Management Team) and issuing of Security Notes.

The primary focus points for the security team are:

(1) Securing the OpenStack code base

(2) Providing deployers with the documentation needed to make sound security choices when deploying or consuming OpenStack

(3) Helping address security needs in a cross project collaborative way.

Author and maintain the OpenStack Security Guide:

\* <http://docs.openstack.org/sec/>

The security team conducts all non-confidential business on the openstack-sig mailing list with the [Security] tag.

\* Subscribe: <http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-sigs>

We previously used the openstack-security mailing list

\* Archive: <http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-sigs/>

Advisory Activities:

\* Act as a consultancy group for OpenStack developers

\* The Vulnerability Management Team (VMT) exists as a subset of the Security SIG

\* VMT confidentially handles vulnerability disclosures

\* The wider security SIG can confirm vulnerability severity at the request of the VMT

Security Guidance:

\* OpenStack Security Notes provide Security Guidance on OpenStack Configuration and Usage: <https://launchpad.net/ossn/>

\* Issued Security Notes: <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security_Notes>

Research Activities:

\* Exploits / Proofs of Concept

Membership:

In April 2015 the Security SIG became an official part of OpenStack. Previously the security team was comprised of two separate organisations; the VMT and the OSSG. The VMT was a small team handling critical vulnerability reports and remediation whereas the OSSG formed the bulk of the remaining security activities within OpenStack. In early 2015 these teams merged, this was quickly followed by the Security team being accepted into OpenStack.

History of the OSSG:

Originally instigated in 2012 by HP and Nebula, the OSSG initially sought to work on an invite only basis, seeking to draw in contributors from large OpenStack teams such as Rackspace, Ubuntu and Red Hat. The team has grown significantly in size and function and now works on a moderated list model, we're open to contributors of all types and the list is moderated simply to keep out spammers.

In early 2018 what was the Security Project became the Security SIG

Security GIG Code of Ethics:

Members of the security team agree that the goals of the group are to improve the security of OpenStack. Information made available to the security team may at times be sensitive and should always be treated as confidential, not to be shared outside of the group. Members are expressly prohibited from profiting by sharing vulnerability or exploit information obtained from the security team with a third party. All group members agree to abide by industry best practices in responsible disclosure, including providing proper attribution for any technical contributions.

Leadership:

The security SIG has no formal leadership, instead it has chairs, with the current chairs being Luke Hinds (Red Hat) and Gage Hugo (AT&T).

Leadership Functions:

\* Formal liaison with OpenStack teams

\* Security team co-ordination

\* Driving Security Awareness

\* Providing Suggestions for Research Direction

\* More

Ongoing Tasks for the Security SIG:

\* Recruiting security talent

\* Evangelizing security within the community

\* Document current best practices - useful as a documentation exercise and for understanding next steps. (e.g., if best practices involve strongly isolating a particular component b/c it is riddled with security issues, then that will help reveal where we should be working)

\* Develop stress tests that can be integrated with current testing

### Bug Description

The ScaleIO driver uses the backend storage login and password for authentication for connections to the volume as well as the management API.

<https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/cinder/tree/cinder/volume/drivers/dell_emc/scaleio/driver.py?h=13.0.4#n176>

<https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/cinder/tree/cinder/volume/drivers/dell_emc/scaleio/driver.py?h=13.0.4#n229>

This has a few serious implications:

a) A user can create a volume, retrieve the username/password from that volume, and use it to connect to a different tenant's volume. Most drivers create per-volume credentials.

b) A user can create a volume, retrieve the username/password from that volume, and use it to connect to the ScaleIO management API and presumably do lots of things they shouldn't be allowed to. Most drivers create credentials for volumes that are independent of the management credentials.

c) If the password is changed on the backend ScaleIO volumes that are currently being used stop working, because Nova stores the old password in its block\_device\_mapping table. (Not a security problem other than the fact that it prevents rotation of passwords, but definitely a bug.)

Parts of these issues are separately being looked at in [bug 1736773](/bugs/1736773), (which generally advises that in some clouds, only Nova should be able to see connection info, not end users) but the situation there is worse for the ScaleIO driver because most drivers only put usernames/passwords in connection\_info that are usable for a single volume, not for the storage backend itself.

It doesn't look like this report has seen any activity since my update two months ago, so consider this a friendly reminder:

The embargo for this report is due to expire one month from today, on May 27, and will be switched public on or shortly after that day if it is not already resolved sooner.

Thanks!

Checking with the team, it sounds like this may be a limitation with how this storage works. Whether the product can be changed to address this has yet to be determined. The "fix" for this may end up needing to be a documentation update alerting operators that this is a concern they need to be aware of.

It sounds like this could wind up being a class B1 report (can only be fixed in master) like related [bug 1736773](/bugs/1736773), or B2 (vulnerability without a complete fix yet, security note for all versions):

<https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#incident-report-taxonomy>

If we can get some confirmation that there's unlikely to be any backportable fix on the way, then we may as well switch this to public ahead of the embargo expiration rather than delaying further. Thanks for checking!

VxFlex OS does not support multi-tenancy or per-volume authentication yet. We suggest to eliminate passing credentials from Cinder to Nova and storing them in “block\_device\_mapping” so that users won’t see any. Instead a separate file will be placed on each host. It will contain the same backend credentials parameters from similar sections in cinder.conf, e.g.

[vxflexos-1]

san\_password = password1

[vxflexos-2]

san\_password = password2

replication\_san\_password = replication\_password2

Whenever Nova tries to connect a block device it will get the storage credentials from the file.

If I'm reading correctly, the proposed fix will require configuration changes for existing deployments, so we'll likely want a security note (OSSN) for this but we would not produce an advisory (OSSA).

@Jeremy and other VMT people: Now that it looks like we're closing in on a solution, how can we handle this? It would be good if we could give operators a heads up before the OSSN is published, because until they both have os-brick patched on all computes and the config file deployed on all hosts with a new password, they can't really fix this (except to change the password early so that no new connections to the backend can be made, which would be pretty disruptive). The statement in the description says "This embargo shall not extend past 2020-05-27 and will be made

public by or on that date if no fix is identified" -- since a fix has been identified, can we extend the embargo a bit?

It was meant to read "will be made public by or on that date EVEN if no fix is identified" since the policy change linked in my accompanying comment says:

Embargoes for privately-reported vulnerabilities shall not last

    more than 90 days, except under unusual circumstances. Following

    the embargo expiration, reports will be publicly visible

    regardless of whether an advisory has been issued.

(now published at <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/tags/vulnerability_managed.html#requirements> )

We also don't have any process identified for notifying consumers privately to make configuration changes; our OSSA process is focused on applying patches since the primary audience is downstream package maintainers for distributions (though we do have some large public cloud operators subscribed to receive advance copies of those patches for evaluation as well). In the past our policy for fixes requiring configuration changes has been to make them public as quickly as possible so that all operators/users can apply mitigations sooner.

That said, the embargo expiration policy does carve out an exception for "unusual circumstances" and we could attempt to reuse our pre-OSSA notification channel for OSSN guidance (I think it's been done once, several years ago). I still wonder why we need an exception here, since the report sat ignored for 10 months and saw no activity until it was nearing the new embargo expiration. If it wasn't critical enough for anyone to even comment on for nearly a year, is it really so critical that we need to continue to keep it a secret now? And if so, how long past May 27 do you propose extending it the embargo? Three days? A week?

os-brick patch:

pep8 problem:

./os\_brick/tests/initiator/connectors/test\_scaleio.py:49:28: E241 multiple spaces after ':'

            'config\_group': 'test',

(please fix or we'll have trouble when we try to merge this)

cinder patch:

passes pep8, py36,37,38, docs, functional-py36,38, pylint

Doc changes look OK, though someone who knows more triple-O should verify the text in the "Using VxFlex OS Storage with a containerized overcloud" section.

I think the code looks OK, but definitely need more eyes on this.

Other things to consider: Is this patch backportable (at least as far as stable/stein)? Can someone draft the intended configuration guidance to operators which would be necessary for an OSSN? I assume there's not much point to a typical DevStack+Tempest run with it, but does it still work on the VXFlexOS third-party CI environment with no test regressions?

Thanks, Jeremy, those are all good points. Here are my thoughts, though I encourage other members of cinder coresec to add comments:

> Is this patch backportable (at least as far as stable/stein)?

It should be a clean backport, plus the change is isolated to vxflexos/scaleio components in both cinder and os-brick, so it would be a very low risk of destabilizing deployments not using that backend.

> Can someone draft the intended configuration guidance to operators which would be necessary for an OSSN?

I can do this as soon as we've reached agreement that this is the correct fix, unless someone at Dell/EMC would prefer to do it. (I think the configuration guidance in the docs change in the cinder patch is very clear.)

> I assume there's not much point to a typical DevStack+Tempest run with it, but does it still work on the VXFlexOS third-party CI environment with no test regressions?

Ivan or someone from the Dell/EMC team: please leave some details about your testing on this patch so we have a record that it doesn't cause a regression. Bonus points if you can provide some indication that it works, e.g., nova bdm record without the password showing, calls to the Block Storage Attachments API showing no password, etc.

If I read the os-brick patch correctly, it is going to have brick read the username password from a config file. just a reminder that this wont work in the case of a user attaching a volume to a bare metal host unless the user has that password config file available as well. cinder client uses os-brick locally during a user attach from a BM host via the python brick cinder client extension. <https://github.com/openstack/python-brick-cinderclient-ext>

VxFlex OS volumes attach/detach operations do not work out of the box. To attach volume to bare metal host we need to install VxFlexx OS SDC component and create password file.

So the security issue will still continue when users need to attach volumes to the BM host.

Good point, Walt. It sounds like we will have to recommend that vxflexos/scaleio not be used with bare metal, because all an attacker would have to do is boot a BM host, and they can obtain the credentials for the entire backend.

Ivan, do you see any way around that?

Do you mean Ironic-like cases with normal user BMs? It should not be allowed with the storage. Any host that needs connection to the VxFlex OS storage must have client side software installed and configured as superuser. And for OpenStack there is now additional requirement of the config file with admin credentials. Client side VxFlex software creates virtual block devices on hosts that are passed to VMs.

So I would say no user BMs are supported / recommended. VMs are welcome.

Vladislav: thanks for confirming.

Ivan: I looked at the tarfile, but the tempest.log is really hard to read about what tests were run and the results. Could you send the console log, or whatever would show that? What I mean is something like:

<https://ftp.nimblestorage.com/openstack_ci/iscsi/83/730183/1/check/nimble-iscsi-driver-dsvm-volume/32f9c4e/console.out>

About halfway through that file you can see the tempest regex filter being used and then the results of the individual tests. Something like that would be really helpful.

https://ftp.nimblestorage.com/openstack\_ci/iscsi/83/730183/1/check/nimble-iscsi-driver-dsvm-volume/32f9c4e/console.out
About halfway through that file you can see the tempest regex filter being used and then the results of the individual tests. Something like that would be really helpful.

As it stands now, this report is still scheduled to switch from Private Security to Public Security tomorrow with the expiration of its embargo. Do we have a reason to extend the embargo and keep it private for longer? This seems to be the current status:

1. There is a solution proposed where, once two patches are applied (comment #6 and comment #15), the operator can configure a safe operating mode for use with virtual server instances.

2. There is no identified solution for using this driver with bare metal instances, nor does one seem to be possible due to the design of the storage platform itself, so the guidance to operators is to not combine them (comment #20).

3. Tests of the proposed patch have been performed in a suitable lab environment, but sufficient evidence has not been provided for reviewers to confirm it's working to their satisfaction (comment #21).

4. Backports of the proposed patch to stable branches have not been provided yet, but it's expected to be trivial to cherry-pick and the implementation is presumed to meet OpenStack's stable branch policy (comment #13).

5. There was a suggestion that users of the driver should be provided an advance copy of the patches and configuration guidance so they will have time to secure their environments before the bug becomes public (comment #9).

If we were to extend the embargo on this report by a week, say to June 3, would that be enough time to address these points? Or will switching to public tomorrow (so patches can be pushed to Gerrit for broader review, more readable third-party test results can be generated and linked, et cetera) be preferable?

Jeremy, thanks for the update. If we can extend the embargo to June 3, that will be extremely helpful. While drafting the OSSN, I realized that the backports will not be as easy as I thought. To be specific, this problem applies to all stable branches, and we have a rename and some refactoring to deal with. So instead of having a single patch that could be applied to multiple releases, we're going to need multiple patches. The extra time would enable us to have these all ready for operators. I'll provide the details in another comment.

Here's why the details in the OSSN patch are a TODO:

Cinder changes

change to cinder/volume/drivers/dell\_emc/vxflexos/rest\_client.py

change to cinder/volume/drivers/dell\_emc/vxflexos/driver.py

train: no rest client, all changes to be made to cinder/volume/drivers/dell\_emc/vxflexos/driver.py

"scaleio" driver

pike, queens, rocky, stein: changes to cinder/volume/drivers/dell\_emc/scaleio/driver.py

ocata: will need a different patch for cinder/volume/drivers/dell\_emc/scaleio/driver.py due to refactoring in rocky

os-brick changes

----------------

Component was not renamed, so all scaleio.

os\_brick/initiator/connectors/scaleio.py

looks like same change in

pike, queens, rocky, stein, train, ussuri, master

os\_brick/privileged/scaleio.py

introduced in stein

ocata, pike, queens, rocky: doesn't exist

After discussing with the other members of the OpenStack VMT, we've agreed bumping the embargo expiration out an additional week should be fine, so I've updated it to June 3.

After reading through, it seems this flaw is CVE-worthy (vs an OSSN / hardening). The main security point is that a user can retrieve their own volume's connection information and then use it to access another user's volume/info.

Per Brian's draft OSSN notes: "When using Cinder with the Dell EMC ScaleIO or VxFlex OS backend storage driver, credentials for the entire backend are exposed in the ``connection\_info`` element in all Block Storage v3 Attachments API calls containing that element. This enables an end user to create a volume, make an API call to show the attachment detail information, and retrieve a username and password that may be used to connect to another user's volume. Additionally, these credentials are valid for the ScaleIO or VxFlex OS Management API, should an attacker discover the Management API endpoint."

Will the OpenStack VMT move this to a CVE (OSSA)? Or is there a reason to see/keep this flaw at the hardening level?

Summer: To be handled as an advisory, the patches provided would need to completely fix the flaw, not merely allow an operator to configure the environment so that the flaw was no longer present. Basically we'd need agreement of the driver and Cinder/Brick maintainers as well as the OpenStack stable branch reviewers that such a default behavior change is appropriate to backport to all supported stable branches. In this case, I think it basically means a violation of OpenStack's typical stable branch policies because there would be new configuration settings required for the deployment, effectively breaking the storage backend until they were set. If the vulnerability is so severe that stable deployments are better off taken down until they can be reconfigured, then we should discuss this option further (I just wish people were interested enough in securing this nearly a year ago when the vulnerability was reported rather than waiting until the VMT was ready to make it public so that concerned users could at least stop using this long-vulnerable driver).

Hi Jeremy, absolutely agree that this could have been dealt with sooner. That said, my comment was that the flaw is serious enough to be categorized as a CVE, regardless of how it's dealt with. The patch will at least offer a mitigation. Will you be asking mitre for a CVE? RH can do that once it's public if you want.

Summer: Unless the plan changes to provide patches which fix this vulnerability for existing configurations or by breaking deployments until updated configuration is applied, which is likely even impossible for anyone who's been using the driver with bare metal instances unless the vendor alters the design of their product, the OpenStack VMT won't be issuing an advisory; and we only request CVEs from MITRE if an advisory is being drafted.

Publication of guidance to deployers and distributors for securing the software is still encouraged--we have a less formal "security note" process we recommend for this purpose--and if you wish to assign a CVE along with it then feel free to do so. All we ask is that you update this bug report with the CVE identifier so that multiple organizations don't do the same and wind up with duplicate CVEs.

According to the stable branch policy [0], "OpenStack Vulnerability Management will be reasonable efforts only" for branches in Extended Maintenance mode.

The following cinder and os-brick branches are in EM mode:

- ocata

- pike

- queens

- rocky

I think it is reasonable to push this fix as far back as Queens.

Ocata will take unreasonable effort. The requirements team was able to make some changes to get their Ocata gate moving again so they could push some requirements changes to hopefully unblock everyone else, but it hasn't worked for cinder [1] and os-brick [2], at least, and there seems to be a consensus building on the mailing list that Ocata needs to go EOL [3]. So I will declare right now we do not need to prepare an Ocata patch for this bug.

I'm willing to hear opinions about Pike (my personal opinion is that it is \*not\* reasonable effort). Right now, the cinder [4] and os-brick [5] gates are broken. The word on the street is that it can be fixed by modifying some of the test jobs to native zuul v3 jobs, but I haven't looked into it because the last change to cinder:stable/pike was 6 months ago, and the last change to os-brick:stable/pike was over 1 year ago. I am dubious that we will get the cinder/os-brick Pike gates working before 3 June (the PTG is next week, which basically leaves us tomorrow to get the gates fixed, and I would rather spend the time reviewing and getting the patches in place for Queens through master (Victoria). Further, there has not been a lot of interest in Pike (as evidenced by lack of backport activity), so I think it makes sense not to put effort into making a patch available for Pike.

So, to be completely clear:

\* Ocata - no patch

\* Pike - I'm inclined to say no patch, but am interested in other opinions.

\* Queens through Victoria - we should have patches available

There's also the option of just getting the backports through stable/stein ready to push at the same time an OSSN is published, and let any interested parties backport to older branches afterward. If you do mention EM branch commits, the way the VMT usually phrases it is along the lines of, "the stable/rocky branch is under extended maintenance and will receive no new point releases, but a patch for it is provided as a courtesy."

I agree with Brian's assessment.

We just need Queens yet, and we should be ready to move ahead.

If we can get a patch for Pike, great. If that becomes too difficult due to code changes or other factors, I think we're fine.

Ocata is definitely too old and is likely to go EOL soon. Again, if a patch is available, that's a bonus. But I don't see that as a requirement.

I'll update the OSSN draft later today and get these patches reviewed (though of course, everyone should feel free to review/test them!).

With the PTG next week, we should figure out the timing of this. Jeremy, can you suggest how this should go?

rosmaita

- git review of OSSN-0086 <-- what time should I submit this?

- after it is approved, will paste the text into the wiki and send a message to the ML

pcheli

- have patched local branches set up so that you can do 'git review' from each one

- should there be a patch directly to ussuri, or will we backport the patch from master?

- rosmaita and smcginnis - be available to approve patches as they are proposed

Ivan, what time zone are you in?

The stable/pike branch is in Extended Maintenance mode and is no

    deployment, you must make a corresponding change to the os-brick

    library. You can find the os-brick patch for stable/pike here:

        <https://review.opendev.org/#/c/733615>

Additionally, you must deploy a new configuration file on compute

    attachment in your deployment. See the documentation change on

    this patch for details about the new config file.

ScaleIO: Connection info backward compatibility

When we fixed [bug 1823200](/bugs/1823200) in Change-ID

    Iab54c515fe7be252df52b1a0503a251779805759 we made the ScaleIO connector

    incompatible with the old connection properties dictionary as it only

    supported the new 'config\_group' and 'failed\_over' parameters to get the

    password.

This is a problem in any system that is upgraded and has attachments to

    the array, because the connection properties of those volumes will not

    contain the new fields and detaching them will result in error

    "KeyError: 'config\_group'".

This patch adds compatibility code to support the old connection

    properties format so we can detach those volumes.

ScaleIO: Connection info backward compatibility
When we fixed bug 1823200 in Change-ID
Iab54c515fe7be252df52b1a0503a251779805759 we made the ScaleIO connector
incompatible with the old connection properties dictionary as it only
supported the new 'config\_group' and 'failed\_over' parameters to get the
password.
This is a problem in any system that is upgraded and has attachments to
the array, because the connection properties of those volumes will not
contain the new fields and detaching them will result in error
"KeyError: 'config\_group'".
This patch adds compatibility code to support the old connection
properties format so we can detach those volumes.
This patch includes the release note from Change
Ib98043358d51426ca650104ad59a7e09911ee8e9

I want to add an addendum to comment #55. That roll-out plan worked fine, except that we should have used the same Change-Id on all the cinder patches, and same Change-Id on all the os-brick patches. This would have made it easier for people looking to see which branches contained the fix, because they would have been connected in the way backports usually are.

## Dell EMC ScaleIO/VxFlex OS Backend Credentials Exposure

### Summary

This vulnerability is present when using Cinder with a Dell EMC ScaleIO or VxFlex OS storage backend.

Note: The Dell EMC "ScaleIO" driver was rebranded as "VxFlex OS" in the Train release.

### Affected Services / Software

Cinder / Ocata, Pike, Queens, Rocky, Stein, Train, Ussuri

This vulnerability applies only when using a Dell EMC ScaleIO/VxFlexOS Backend with Cinder. Other drivers are not impacted.

### Discussion

When using Cinder with the Dell EMC ScaleIO or VxFlex OS backend storage driver, credentials for the entire backend are exposed in the ``connection\_info`` element in all Block Storage v3 Attachments API calls containing that element. This enables an end user to create a volume, make an API call to show the attachment detail information, and retrieve a username and password that may be used to connect to another user's volume. Additionally, these credentials are valid for the ScaleIO or VxFlex OS Management API, should an attacker discover the Management API endpoint.

This issue was reported by David Hill and Eric Harney of Red Hat.

### Recommended Actions

Remediation of this issue consists of the following:

1. Patching the ScaleIO or VxFlex OS Cinder driver so that it no longer provides the password to Cinder when a Block Storage v3 Attachments API response is constructed.

2. Patching the ScaleIO connector in the os-brick library so that it retrieves the password from a configuration file readable only by root. (Note: the connector was not rebranded; both ScaleIO and VxFlex OS backends use the 'scaleio' os-brick connector.)

3. Patching the ScaleIO os-brick privileged file that allows the scaleio connector to escalate privileges for specific operations; this is necessary to allow the connector process to access the configuration file that is readable only by root.

4. Deploying a configuration file containing the password (and replication password, if applicable) to all compute nodes, cinder nodes, and anywhere you would perform a volume attachment in your deployment.

To refresh database information, all volumes should be detached and reattached.

Because this remediation consists of deploying credentials in a root-readable-only file, it is not suitable for the use case of attaching a volume to a bare metal host. Thus, the Dell EMC ScaleIO/VxFlex OS storage backend for Cinder is \*not recommended\* for use with bare metal hosts.

Note: The Ocata, Pike, Queens, and Rocky branches of OpenStack are in the Extended Maintenance phase. Point releases are no longer made from these branches and security patches are produced only on a reasonable effort basis. Patches for Queens and Rocky are provided as a courtesy. Patches for Ocata and Pike are not available.

#### Patches

Both cinder and os-brick must be patched. Documentation is provided as part of the cinder patch concerning the new configuration file that must be deployed to all compute nodes, cinder nodes, and anywhere you would perform a volume attachment in your deployment.

NOTE (added 2020-06-18): The original patch for os-brick contained
a flaw [0] that prevented the scaleio connector from operating when run
under Python 2.7. Thus for OpenStack releases supporting Python 2.7
(that is, Train and earlier), a second os-brick patch is required and
is listed below. The list of available releases has also been updated
to address this issue.
