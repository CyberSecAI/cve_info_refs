Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Keycloak's handling of the `redirect_uri` parameter during OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication flows. Specifically, Keycloak allows the use of unsafe schemes within the `redirect_uri`, which can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the potential for XSS attacks. By injecting malicious code into the `redirect_uri` using a dangerous scheme, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser when the user is redirected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
  - **Execution of malicious JavaScript:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
  - **Session hijacking:** This could lead to session hijacking, allowing an attacker to impersonate a user and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
  - **Data theft:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive information or credentials.
  - **Defacement or other malicious actions:** The attacker could modify the website the victim is accessing or carry out other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious `redirect_uri` with an unsafe scheme and injects it into an OIDC authentication flow.
- The user is then tricked into initiating the authentication flow (e.g., by clicking a link or through a malicious website).
- Once the user is redirected back to the application using the malicious `redirect_uri`, the injected JavaScript is executed in the victimâ€™s browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to manipulate or influence the `redirect_uri` parameter within the Keycloak OIDC authentication flow. This could be achieved by:
  - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks:** Intercepting and modifying the authentication request to inject the malicious `redirect_uri`.
  - **Social engineering:** Tricking the victim into clicking a malicious link that contains a crafted `redirect_uri`.
  - **Compromised application:** Leveraging vulnerabilities in a client application using Keycloak to influence the `redirect_uri`.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to the Keycloak instance to trigger the vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**

- Red Hat suggests the use of "Trusted Hosts Policy" as a mitigation measure. This policy allows administrators to define a list of allowed redirect URIs, thus preventing the use of unsafe schemes. This mitigation measure is explained in the following link: <https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#client-registration-policies>
- The vulnerability is fixed in Keycloak version 12.0.0
- Several Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA) address this issue:
