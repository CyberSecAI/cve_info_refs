  "summary": "The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling U3D objects in PDFs. An attacker can achieve information disclosure by tricking a user into opening a malicious PDF file. This vulnerability can also be leveraged with others to execute code."
