| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1835127#c0)  Marian Rehak    2020-05-13 08:04:26 UTC  ``` NFS client crashes due to index buffer overflow during Direct IO write. In some circumstances, it reaches out of the index after just one memory allocation by kmalloc which is causing kernel panic at random function. (sub_debug shows Redzone is overwritten)  Upstream Issue:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1824270](show_bug.cgi?id=1824270 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-10742 kernel: NFS client crash due to index buffer overflow during Direct IO write causing kernel panic [rhel-7]")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1835127#c1)  Marian Rehak    2020-05-13 08:05:03 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1835128](show_bug.cgi?id=1835128 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2020-10742 kernel: NFS client crash due to index buffer overflow during Direct IO write causing kernel panic [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1835127#c3)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2020-05-14 21:28:01 UTC  ``` Hi Marian,  I'm trying to track this issue for Debian, and looked as well up [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1824270](show_bug.cgi?id=1824270 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-10742 kernel: NFS client crash due to index buffer overflow during Direct IO write causing kernel panic [rhel-7]"). Do you have any additional information on this issue: Did it ever affected mainline/upstream or is the issue specific to the Red Hat kernel?  Regards, Salvatore   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1835127#c4)  Marian Rehak    2020-05-18 11:02:17 UTC  ``` Hello Salvatore,  This flaw is based on the bz you mentioned so there are no additional information apart from that as far as I know. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.  Best regards. Marian   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1835127#c6)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2020-05-22 15:31:31 UTC  ``` Hi Marian,  (In reply to Marian Rehak from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1835127#c4)) > Hello Salvatore, >  > This flaw is based on the bz you mentioned so there are no additional > information apart from that as far as I know. I'm sorry I couldn't be of > more help.  Okay thanks, I was hoping there was more already known as it mentioned an internal discussion for developing the kernel patches which then were specifically applied to the 3.10 version.  I was not able to triggere the issue for instance in 4.19.118, and with only the available information I was suspecting it might be fixed in 3.11-rc1 upstream something related to 18aad3d552c7 ("NFSv4.1 Refactor nfs4_init_session and nfs4_init_channel_attrs") and/or 68bf05efb7fa ("nfs41: fix session fore channel negotiation") or maybe something completely else.  This would be as well inline with the fact that a fix was only needed for RHEL7 with kernel-3.10.0-1140.el7?  Thanks for taking time here to reply to my query.  Regards, Salvatore   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1835127#c10)  Alex    2020-05-31 10:28:02 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1835127#c3): > Hi Marian, >  > I'm trying to track this issue for Debian, and looked as well up > [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1824270](show_bug.cgi?id=1824270 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-10742 kernel: NFS client crash due to index buffer overflow during Direct IO write causing kernel panic [rhel-7]"). Do you have any > additional information on this issue: Did it ever affected mainline/upstream > or is the issue specific to the Red Hat kernel? >  > Regards, > Salvatore  Hi Salvatore,  Based on the info from engineering:  "Upstream, nfs_direct_write_schedule_segment was removed in v3.16, and iovec has been transformed to iov_iter, so this is a RHEL-only patch."  which is from our rhel-7 patch.  Best Regards, Alexander   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1835127#c14)  Marian Rehak    2020-06-02 10:30:02 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Jay Shin (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1835127#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-09-29 18:59:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2020:4062 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:4062](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A4062)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1835127#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-09-29 20:54:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2020:4060 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:4060](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A4060)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1835127#c18)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-09-29 22:00:54 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

It seems infeasible to convert to iov_iter, so let's abandon that.  One issue with using krealloc() though is that you'll be incurring an unnecessary memcpy() penalty.  It's nice to reuse the pages, but there's no need to copy over the pointer values from the last pass, right?  It seems we ought to be able correctly calculate the the maximum pages needed before we enter the loop.. perhaps it makes sense to just assume that we're going to potentially cross a page boundary on the next pass through the loop, so let's just allocate the extra page ptr in the first place.  We're not allocating a page, we're just allocating a pointer.  What do you think?   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1824270#c21)  Benjamin Coddington    2020-04-28 11:17:54 UTC  ``` Well, the other difference is that in the RHEL 7 loop, there are a number of checks that can cause the loop to abort.  If you abort the loop after allocating, you have to handle code paths to free those pointers each time.  However, we can simply handle this case by always allocating an extra pointer:  diff --git a/fs/nfs/direct.c b/fs/nfs/direct.c index f639618b7a2d..d3cc27cd28df 100644 --- a/fs/nfs/direct.c +++ b/fs/nfs/direct.c @@ -873,7 +873,7 @@ static ssize_t nfs_direct_write_schedule_segment(struct nfs_pageio_descriptor *d                 result = -ENOMEM;                 npages = nfs_page_array_len(pgbase, bytes);                 if (!pagevec) -                       pagevec = kmalloc(npages * sizeof(struct page *), GFP_KERNEL); +                       pagevec = kmalloc((npages + 1) * sizeof(struct page *), GFP_KERNEL);                 if (!pagevec)                         break;     What do you think?   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1824270#c33)  Steve Whitehouse    2020-04-30 11:19:56 UTC  ``` Ben, what is the current status here?
