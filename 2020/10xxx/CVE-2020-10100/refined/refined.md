Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly implement access controls related to viewing ticket customer details, allowing users to bypass intended restrictions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insufficient Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks. This allows users from one company to access data from other companies within the multi-tenant system.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can view and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data belonging to other companies using the same Zammad instance.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Application Functionality:** Attackers leverage the existing functionality for viewing ticket customer details.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Valid User Account:** An attacker needs a valid user account within the Zammad system.
    *   **Multi-Tenancy:**  The vulnerability is exploitable due to the multi-tenant nature of the application. An attacker in one tenant can view data in other tenants.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in Zammad versions 1.0.x up to 3.2.0. Due to insufficient access controls, users can view ticket customer details and data of other companies using the same Zammad instance. This can lead to sensitive data exfiltration from other organizations. The vulnerability is fixed in Zammad versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.0.
