Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `EmbeddedManagedProcess` API in Wildfly, which exposes a public method for setting the Thread Context Classloader (TCCL).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Exposed TCCL Setting:** The core issue is the ability to set the TCCL via a public method within the `EmbeddedManagedProcess` API.
- **Security Manager Bypass:** This exposed method allows for bypassing the security manager, which is intended to restrict access to sensitive resources and operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** The primary threat is to confidentiality. This suggests that by manipulating the TCCL, an attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information.
   - This is further supported by the "medium" severity rating.
- The ability to bypass the Security Manager opens up other potential attack vectors which could result in other impact types

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the exposed public method of the `EmbeddedManagedProcess` API in Wildfly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to invoke this exposed public method to set the TCCL. This would likely require an existing foothold within the application or a related system where the API is accessible.

**Summary**
The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the Thread Context Classloader (TCCL) by using a public method in the `EmbeddedManagedProcess` API, bypassing the security manager and potentially gaining access to sensitive information.
