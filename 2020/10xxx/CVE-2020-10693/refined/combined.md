| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1805501#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2020-02-20 21:54:48 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in hibernate-validator 6.1.2.Final. A bug in the interpolation of constraint error messages code enables invalid EL expressions to be evaluated as if they were valid. This bug enables attackers to bypass input sanitation (escaping, stripping) controls that developers may have put in place when handling user-controlled data in error messages.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1805501#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2020-02-20 22:00:11 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Alvaro Muñoz (GitHub Security Labs)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1805501#c5)  Summer Long    2020-03-05 04:33:12 UTC  ``` Statement:  hibernate-validator is packaged with Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0's OpenDaylight (ODL). However, because ODL is technical preview in this version and the flaw is moderate, Red Hat will not be releasing a fix for the OpenStack package at this time.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1805501#c16)  Ted Jongseok Won    2020-05-05 07:13:12 UTC  ``` Created hibernate-validator tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-30 [[bug 1831527](show_bug.cgi?id=1831527 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-10693 hibernate-validator: Improper input validation in the interpolation of constraint error messages [fedora-30]")]   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1805501#c21)  Ted Jongseok Won    2020-06-29 06:51:05 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  You can pass user input as an expression variable by unwrapping the context to HibernateConstraintValidatorContext.
