Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-10693

**Root Cause:**
- Improper input validation in the message interpolation processor of Hibernate Validator. Specifically, the code allows invalid Expression Language (EL) expressions to be evaluated as if they were valid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  The vulnerability lies in the way Hibernate Validator handles EL expressions within constraint error messages. It fails to properly sanitize or validate these expressions, leading to the execution of potentially malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can bypass input sanitation controls (escaping, stripping) that developers have implemented when handling user-controlled data in error messages. This could lead to various issues, such as:
    -  Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
    - Information disclosure
    - Other forms of injection attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could inject malicious EL expressions within user-controlled data that would later be used in error messages by the application using the vulnerable Hibernate Validator library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input that will be used in the construction of error messages that are processed by the vulnerable component. This could be through various means depending on how the application uses Hibernate Validator, such as through user input in forms, or through other data sources that are not properly sanitized.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Hibernate Validator versions 6.1.2.Final and earlier, as indicated by the fix versions (7.0.0.Alpha2, 6.1.5.Final, 6.0.20.Final) listed in the bug report.
- Mitigation is possible by passing user input as an expression variable by unwrapping the context to `HibernateConstraintValidatorContext`.
- Several Red Hat products were affected, with fixes released via various RHSA (Red Hat Security Advisory) errata.
