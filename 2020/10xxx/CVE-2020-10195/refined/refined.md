The provided content is related to CVE-2020-10195.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Popup Builder plugin had insufficient access control mechanisms, allowing logged-in users with minimal permissions to perform privileged actions. Specifically, the `saveSettings`, `getSubscribersCsvFile`, and `getSystemInfoFile` functions were vulnerable because they lacked proper capability checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** Lack of proper capability checks on multiple admin-post actions.
2.  **Information Disclosure:**  Export of sensitive newsletter subscriber information via `getSubscribersCsvFile`, and exposure of system configuration data through `getSystemInfoFile`.
3. **Privilege Escalation:**  Modification of plugin settings, allowing subscribers to gain additional permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **Data Breach:** Sensitive newsletter subscriber data could be exposed and potentially used in social engineering attacks.
2.  **System Information Disclosure:**  System configuration details could be accessed, potentially aiding further attacks.
3.  **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can grant themselves access to various plugin features.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **HTTP POST request to `admin-post.php`:**
    *   Setting `action` to `sgpbSaveSettings` and `sgpb-user-roles[]` to `subscriber`, allowing privilege escalation.
    *   Setting `action` to `csv_file` to export subscriber data.
    *   Setting `action` to `sgpb_system_info` to export system information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  The attacker needs to be a logged-in user, even with minimal permissions (e.g., a subscriber).
2.  The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the WordPress `admin-post.php` endpoint.
