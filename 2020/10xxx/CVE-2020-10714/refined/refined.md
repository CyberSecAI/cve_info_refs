{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a session fixation flaw in WildFly Elytron's FORM authentication mechanism, which allows an attacker to perform a session fixation attack when a session ID is present in the URL.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Session fixation vulnerability",
    "Improper handling of session IDs in URLs"
  ],
  "Impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "An attacker can create a session with a session ID present in the URL and trick the victim into accessing the service via the crafted link. ",
    "If the server tracks sessions by both URL and cookie, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sharing a link containing a crafted session ID."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a session and trick the victim into accessing a crafted URL with a fixed session ID."
