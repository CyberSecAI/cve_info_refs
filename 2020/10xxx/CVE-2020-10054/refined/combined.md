WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply security hardening of the Windows Server, where the RTLS Locating Manager is installed on,

in accordance with your corporate security policies or up-to-date hardening guidelines

• Ensure that only trusted persons have access to the system and avoid the conﬁguration of additional

local accounts on the server

with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-10052

The affected application writes sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords in log ﬁles. A local
attacker with access to the log ﬁles could use this information to launch further attacks.

CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File

Vulnerability CVE-2020-10053

The affected application writes sensitive data, such as database credentials in conﬁguration ﬁles. A
local attacker with access to the conﬁguration ﬁles could use this information to launch further attacks.
