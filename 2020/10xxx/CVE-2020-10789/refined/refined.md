Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-10789:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The embedded terminal within openITCOCKPIT did not properly escape user input, leading to a code injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Code injection vulnerability due to lack of proper input sanitization in the embedded terminal.
- The vulnerability is specifically in how the embedded terminal handles user input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution. An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting malicious commands via the terminal.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the embedded terminal interface. An attacker would need to interact with this interface to inject the malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have access to the openITCOCKPIT web interface where the embedded terminal is located.
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with the embedded terminal.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by removing the embedded terminal and its related code in openITCOCKPIT version 3.7.3.
- The fix also includes removing related code from various files including:
    -   `app/Config/auth_actions.php`
    -   `app/Config/menu.php`
    -   `app/Controller/CommandsController.php`
    -   `app/Lib/SudoMessageInterface.php`
    -  `app/View/Commands/add.ctp`
    -  `app/View/Commands/edit.ctp`
    -  `app/webroot/js/app/controllers/commands/add_controller.js`
    -  `app/webroot/js/app/controllers/commands/edit_controller.js`
- The vulnerability was reported by Dejan Zelic from Offensive Security.
- The `SudoMessageInterface.php` file shows attempts to restrict commands but it was not effective. It allowed any command as long as the path to the command is specified, and as long as the command does not contain illegal characters, like `;`, `&&`, `$`, `|`, or `` ` ``. It also uses `escapeshellcmd` which is known to not be sufficient to prevent command injection.
