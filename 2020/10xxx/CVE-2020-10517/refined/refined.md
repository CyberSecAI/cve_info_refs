Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10517:

**CVE Description:**

*   An improper access control vulnerability was identified that allowed authenticated users of the instance to determine the names of unauthorized private repositories given their numerical IDs.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an improper access control mechanism that failed to properly restrict access to repository names based on user permissions, allowing unauthorized access to repository names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper access control, allowing authenticated users to access information (repository names) that they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can determine the names of private repositories they are not authorized to access, by knowing the numerical ID.
*   This does not allow access to repository content, only the name.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is an authenticated user of the GitHub Enterprise Server instance exploiting an API or method that leaks the name of private repositories given their numeric ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
*   The attacker needs to know the numerical ID of the private repository.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.
*   This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 2.22.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2020-10517.
