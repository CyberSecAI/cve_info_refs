Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-10983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection, caused by unsanitized input being directly concatenated into a SQL query. Specifically, the `order_id` POST parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or use of parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. This is a blind SQL injection because the attacker cannot see the output directly, they must rely on time-based injection methods to verify query success.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can leak database contents by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, potentially gaining access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/admin/mobile.php` file. The attacker manipulates the `order_id` parameter to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access the vulnerable admin area.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target web application.
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL and time-based blind SQL injection techniques.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `/admin/mobile.php` file between lines 75 and 94.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to cause a time delay, confirming the SQL injection.
- The vendor was notified and a fix was implemented using parameterized queries, which prevents SQL injection by separating the SQL code from the user provided input.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Gambio GX version 4.0.1.0.
