- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Zammad may respond with verbose error messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure through verbose error messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The disclosed internal application or infrastructure information could aid attackers in successfully exploiting other vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly specified, but likely involves triggering application errors through user input or other interaction with the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to interact with the Zammad application in a way that produces error messages.
