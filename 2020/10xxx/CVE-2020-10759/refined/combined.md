# Legacy LVFS S3 bucket takeover and CVE-2020-10759 fwupd signature verification bypass

There were two distinct vulnerabilities:

* A **dangling S3 bucket** that belonged to LVFS (Linux Vendor Firmware Service). The dangling bucket is referenced by the default configuration in `fwupd` version <1.0.6 (Released 2018)
* A **PGP signature verification bypass** in all versions of `fwupd` (CVE-2020-10759)

Taken together, these vulnerabilities would have allowed an attacker who
claimed the S3 bucket to **offer malicious firmware updates to Linux desktops
and servers running legacy versions of `fwupd`**.

[![Debian Stretch gnome-software showing a malicious firmware update](/justinsteven/advisories/raw/master/images/2020_fwupd_dangling_s3_bucket_and_signature_verification_bypass/debian_stretch_gnomesoftware_fwupd_malicious_update.png)](/justinsteven/advisories/blob/master/images/2020_fwupd_dangling_s3_bucket_and_signature_verification_bypass/debian_stretch_gnomesoftware_fwupd_malicious_update.png)

The dangling bucket has been transferred to the control of the LVFS team.

The PGP verification bypass existed in versions of `fwupd` prior to 1.4.0, and
in `libjcat` used by `fwupd` from 1.4.0 onwards. The vulnerability can be fixed
in `fwupd` prior to 1.4.0 by backporting
<https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/commit/21f2d12>, and in `fwupd` from 1.4.0
onwards by using a `libjcat` that includes
<https://github.com/hughsie/libjcat/commit/839b89f>

## Impact of the dangling S3 bucket and signature verification bypass vulnerability

Although the dangling S3 bucket only affected `fwupd` clients with a legacy
configuration, there is a large install base of these clients. For example,
Debian Stretch (currently "oldstable") still ships a version that references
the bucket. Over the course of 26 days, the S3 bucket received more than **2.5
million update requests** from over **500,000 unique IP addresses**.

The following graph shows the average number of update requests seen per hour, per week.

[![graph showing unique ip addresses seen per hour](/justinsteven/advisories/raw/master/images/2020_fwupd_dangling_s3_bucket_and_signature_verification_bypass/traffic_hits_per_hour.png)](/justinsteven/advisories/blob/master/images/2020_fwupd_dangling_s3_bucket_and_signature_verification_bypass/traffic_hits_per_hour.png)

The following graph shows the total number of update requests seen per day.

[![graph showing unique ip addresses seen per day](/justinsteven/advisories/raw/master/images/2020_fwupd_dangling_s3_bucket_and_signature_verification_bypass/traffic_hits_per_day.png)](/justinsteven/advisories/blob/master/images/2020_fwupd_dangling_s3_bucket_and_signature_verification_bypass/traffic_hits_per_day.png)

`gnome-software` typically refreshes `fwupd` data once per day, which is
reflected by the 24-hour cyclical traffic pattern in the first graph. The
number of daily update requests in the second graph is ~100,000 excluding
weekends, and so I estimate that there are **at least 100,000 unique `fwupd`
clients reaching out to the dangling S3 bucket**.

Notwithstanding the dangling S3 bucket issue, the signature bypass
vulnerability would also have been exploitable by an attacker who:

* Can compromise HTTPS connections to a `fwupd` metadata repository; or
* Is in a privileged position within a public `fwupd` metadata repository (such as LVFS); or
* Is in a privileged position within a local metadata mirror (such as one belonging to an enterprise)

## Limitations of the vulnerabilities

Some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), reportedly
do not ship with a configuration that includes the LVFS metadata repository.

`fwupd` does not install firmware updates for users automatically - the user
must manually accept the updates.

Firmware installation can only be done using prescribed protocols implemented
within `fwupd` itself. It is not possible for an update to execute custom code,
such as a proprietary flasher utility, during firmware installation. However,
the vulnerabilities do give the ability to provide malicious input to an XML
parser and `.cab` file parser which run as root. These code paths were not
thoroughly examined.

Some hardware devices perform their own on-chip verification of firmware
updates (based on a key held by the hardware vendor themselves) which could
prevent the installation of some malicious firmware images.

## Timeline of events

## What is LVFS?

LVFS (Linux Vendor Firmware Service) is:

> a secure portal which allows hardware vendors to upload firmware updates.
> [The] site is used by all major Linux distributions to provide metadata for
> clients such as fwupdmgr and GNOME Software.

(<https://fwupd.org/>)

The LVFS is a metadata repository. It contains:

* Descriptions of hardware, the firmware of which can be updated
* URLs of firmware update files (.cab files) which may be hosted either directly on LVFS or on a third-party website
* Cryptographic hashes of the .cab files

See <https://lvfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metainfo.html> for an example of a metadata entry.

The metadata is published as a file named `firmware.xml.gz`. This file can be
verified using a detached PGP signature produced using the LVFS PGP key
(`0x48A6D80E4538BAC2`) or a "jcat" bundle of signatures (PGP and PKCS7) which
will be described later in this advisory.

<https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2019/03/lvfs-project-announcement/> and
<https://youtu.be/u7A7VqQCpIE> give excellent background on the LVFS project.

## What is fwupd?

`fwupd` is:

> a simple daemon to allow session software to update device firmware on your
> local machine. It's designed for desktops, but also usable on phones and
> headless servers. You can either use a GUI software manager like GNOME
> Software to view and apply updates, the command-line tool or the system D-Bus
> interface directly.

(<https://fwupd.org/lvfs/docs/users>)

`fwupd` is responsible for:

* Checking the PGP (`fwupd` <1.4.0) or jcat (`fwupd` >=1.4.0) signature of the firmware metadata from repositories such as LVFS
* Parsing the XML/AppStream firmware metadata
* Informing the user of firmware updates described in the metadata that are available for their hardware, such as BIOS or Thunderbolt controller updates
* Downloading, unpacking and flashing the firmware updates when requested by the user

The firmware installation occurs over a limited number of protocols implemented
within `fwupd`, such as DFU or Fastboot
(<https://fwupd.org/lvfs/docs/metainfo/protocol>). Importantly, it is not
possible for an individual firmware update to run custom code on the user's
machine, such as a proprietary flasher utility.

## What is the LVFS/`fwupd` data flow and security model?

In a nutshell, the data flow and security model appears to be as follows:

1. Within LVFS
   1. Firmware vendors apply to LVFS and are granted permission to upload firmware metadata for certain hardware `vendor-id` value/s (<https://blogs.gnome.org/hughsie/2019/12/11/improving-the-security-model-of-the-lvfs/>)
   2. Firmware vendors submit Firmware metadata and .cab files to LVFS
   3. LVFS collates the metadata for all vendors into one file (`firmware.xml.gz`) which includes cryptographic hashes of each .cab file
   4. LVFS signs this file to produce a detached PGP signature (`firmware.xml.gz.asc`) and jcat (PGP && PKCS7) signature (`firmware.xml.gz.jcat`)
2. On client machines
   1. `fwupdmgr` or `gnome-software` run as non-root *client utilities*
   2. `fwupd` runs as a root system service
   3. The *client utility* periodically downloads:
      * The `firmware.xml.gz` file, as well as:
      * `fwupd` <1.4.0 - `firmware.xml.gz.asc` (e.g. <https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/blob/1.3.9/src/fu-util.c#L1266-L1280>)
      * `fwupd` >= 1.4.0 - `firmware.xml.gz.jcat` (e.g. <https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/blob/1.4.1/src/fu-util.c#L1295-L1315>)
   4. The *client utility* sends the file descriptor of each file to `fwupd` via D-Bus to do an "UpdateMetadata" operation (e.g. <https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/blob/1.4.1/libfwupd/fwupd-client.c#L1420-L1466>)
   5. `fwupd` checks the detached PGP (e.g. <https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/blob/1.3.9/src/fu-keyring-gpg.c#L279-L316>) or jcat signature
      * **This establishes the anchor of trust**. The metadata contains cryptographic hashes (e.g. SHA) of individual firmware updates, and the metadata as a whole is signed by LVFS. This pattern (Signed metadata containing individual checksums) is similar to the `apt` model (<https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt#Secure_apt_groundwork:_checksums>)
   6. Assuming the signature verification succeeds, `fwupd` parses the XML metadata using "a subset of the AppStream component specification" (<https://lvfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metainfo.html>)
   7. `fwupd` scans the system's connected devices and considers the firmware updates available from LVFS
   8. `fwupd` notifies the *client utility* of available firmware updates for the system's connected devices
   9. The user chooses to install the firmware updates via the *client utility*
   10. The *client utility* downloads the .cab file
   11. `fwupd` verifies the .cab file's cryptographic hash against the hash in `firmware.xml.gz`, unpacks it, and flashes the firmware

To put it another way:

* `firmware.xml.gz` is signed as `firmware.xml.gz.asc` or `firmware.xml.gz.jcat`
* `firmware.xml.gz` describes the updates available for various hardware devices, provides a download URL for each update (`.cab` file), and provides cryptographic hashes of the `.cab` files
* The firmware `.cab` files contain flashable firmware update files
* If a firmware `.cab` file's hash matches the hash listed in `firmware.xml.gz`, and the signature of `firmware.xml.gz` is correct, then the `.cab` file can be considered trustworthy

For more information on this security model, see
<https://blogs.gnome.org/hughsie/2016/05/24/lvfs-technical-white-paper/>

Consider the case in which an attacker controls the contents of
`firmware.xml.gz`, and can sign the file or bypass the signature verification
process. The attacker could advertise malicious firmware updates for various
hardware products. If a user chooses to install a malicious update, the
attacker could compromise the user's hardware, violating the integrity of the
user's system.

## Vulnerability: Legacy LVFS S3 bucket takeover (<https://s3.amazonaws.com/lvfsbucket/>)

Releases of `fwupd` ship with URLs of firmware repositories, such as LVFS.
These are the URLs from which information about firmware updates should be
downloaded.

* From version 0.7.3 to 1.0.5, the LVFS URL was <https://s3.amazonaws.com/lvfsbucket/downloads/firmware.xml.gz>
* From version 1.0.6 onwards, the LVFS URL was changed to <https://cdn.fwupd.org/downloads/firmware.xml.gz>

This change occurred in commit <https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/commit/4ee0836>
(28 February 2018) to allow the LVFS project to move from Amazon S3 to an
alternative CDN.

Some Linux distributions (e.g. Red Hat Enterprise Linux) reportedly do not ship
`fwupd` configured to use the LVFS metadata URL.

It was reported to the project in November 2018
([fwupd/fwupd#831](https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/issues/831)) that downloads from the old URL
were failing with 404 errors. The project's solution was for users to update
`fwupd`; or nag their distro to backport a fix. A bug against Debian Stretch
(which is currently "oldstable") was opened in October 2018 at
<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=912414> and is unresolved at
the time of writing.

After the migration away from the Amazon S3 hosting arrangement, the LVFS
project **deleted the `lvfsbucket` S3 bucket**. The LVFS project informed me
during the disclosure process that the S3 bucket was deleted in **November
2019**.

I observed the following in May 2020:

```
$ curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/lvfsbucket/downloads/firmware.xml.gz.asc
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Error><Code>NoSuchBucket</Code><Message>The specified bucket does not exist</Message><BucketName>lvfsbucket</BucketName> [... SNIP ...]

```

With the bucket having been deleted, it was free for registration by any Amazon
AWS customer. The user who registered the bucket would then **receive the
phone-home update requests from users running legacy `fwupd` clients**.

I registered the bucket in May 2020, and enabled S3 access logging on the
bucket (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html>)

Over the course of 26 days, the S3 bucket received more than **2.5 million
update requests** from over **500,000 unique IP addresses**.

Note that, during the time in which the I controlled the S3 bucket, **no
content was published from the bucket**. The bucket returned "403 Forbidden"
for every request made to it.

Control of the bucket gives us the following primitives:

* We can provide arbitrary `firmware.xml.gz` metadata files to legacy `fwupd` clients
* We can provide arbitrary `firmware.xml.gz.asc` signature files to legacy `fwupd` clients

To make use of these primitives, we would need to sign `firmware.xml.gz` using
a trusted LVFS key; or we would need a way to bypass the PGP signature checking
in `fwupd`.

### Recommended Fix

The dangling S3 bucket has been transferred to the LVFS project. The LVFS
project should maintain control of this bucket until legacy versions of `fwupd`
are no longer installed in the field. The bucket should not be deleted until it
is safe to do so.

## Vulnerability: Metadata signature verification bypass in `fwupd` <1.4.0

The PGP-based metadata signature verification in `fwupd` <1.4.0 is
vulnerable and can be reliably bypassed. Any **non-detached** signature signed
by **any key** will defeat the verification logic.

Given this vulnerability, an attacker who claimed the above dangling S3 bucket,
or can otherwise put themselves between `fwupd` clients and a metadata
repository, could have provided signed malicious firmware update information to
`fwupd` clients.

The vulnerability relies on the difference between detached and non-detached
PGP signatures. A primer on PGP signature types is provided in Appendix A.

To be taken as an example, the signature verification code is as follows in
`fwupd` 1.3.9

```
    /* load file data */

    // [SNIP - read the metadata data into 'data']

    // [SNIP - read the metadata signature into 'sig']

    /* verify */
    rc = gpgme_op_verify (self->ctx, sig, data, NULL);
    if (rc != GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR) {
        g_set_error (error,
                 FWUPD_ERROR,
                 FWUPD_ERROR_INTERNAL,
                 "failed to verify data: %s",
                 gpgme_strerror (rc));
        return NULL;
    }

    /* verify the result */
    result = gpgme_op_verify_result (self->ctx);
    if (result == NULL) {
        g_set_error_literal (error,
                     FWUPD_ERROR,
                     FWUPD_ERROR_INTERNAL,
                     "no result record from libgpgme");
        return NULL;
    }

    /* look at each signature */
    for (s = result->signatures; s != NULL ; s = s->next ) {
        g_debug ("returned signature fingerprint %s", s->fpr);
        if (!fu_keyring_gpg_check_signature (s, error))
            return NULL;

        /* save details about the key for the result */
        if ((gint64) s->timestamp > timestamp_newest) {
            timestamp_newest = (gint64) s->timestamp;
            g_string_assign (authority_newest, s->fpr);
        }
    }
    return FU_KEYRING_RESULT (g_object_new (FU_TYPE_KEYRING_RESULT,
                        "timestamp", timestamp_newest,
                        "authority", authority_newest->str,
                        NULL));}
```

(<https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/blob/1.3.9/src/fu-keyring-gpg.c#L255-L316>)

Though this code has changed over time, all versions follow the same general
pattern.

The verification flow is as follows:

1. The signature verification is done by `gpgme_op_verify()` which is provided by `libgpgme` and is documented at <https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gpgme/Verify.html>
   * If `rc = gpgme_op_verify()` fails (i.e. doesn't return `GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR`) the verification is **failed**
2. Details about the verification are fetched using `gpgme_op_verify_result()`
   * If `result = gpgme_op_verify_result()` fails (i.e. returns `NULL`) the verification is **failed**
3. The signatures within `result` are looped over.
   * For each signature, if `fu_keyring_gpg_check_signature()` is unhappy (e.g. the public key was unknown; the signature was bad; the signing key is expired) the verification is **failed**
4. If we get this far, the verification is considered successful

This is arguably a fragile design. A potential attack vector would be to:

* Provide some `data` (xml) and `sig` (asc) data which:
  + Causes `gpgme_op_verify()` (step 1 above) to succeed; and
  + Causes `gpgme_op_verify_result()` (step 2 above) to succeed and to return a `result` with zero signatures
* Due to the fact that there are zero signatures, the `for` loop (step 3 above) will be skipped entirely, and so `fu_keyring_gpg_check_signature()` will not be called, which allows us to skip the fine-grained signature checking
* The function will return "Verification successful" (step 4 above)

We are able to execute this attack due to an edge-case in GPGme (GnuPG Made
Easy) when it tries to verify a normal signature as if it were a detached
signature.

A more robust design would be to:

* Explicitly check that `result->signatures` is non-zero (i.e. at least one signature was observed by `gpgme_op_verify()`); and/or
* Invert the individual signature verification logic. Currently, the code checks to ensure that there are zero "bad" signatures. It would be safer to instead ensure that there is at least one "good" signature. This is the approach taken by `flatpak` <https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/blob/1.7.2/common/flatpak-oci-registry.c#L2073-L2085>)

### GPGme (GnuPG Made Easy)

GPGme is provided by the GnuPG project. It is a library that wraps the `gpg`
command-line utility and exposes GnuPG functionality to software developers.

`fwupd` uses two GPGme functions:

* `gpgme_op_verify()` which performs GnuPG signature verification
* `gpgme_op_verify_result()` which exposes information about a signature verification

The function signature of `gpgme_op_verify()` is as follows:

```
gpgme_error_t gpgme_op_verify (gpgme_ctx_t ctx,
                               gpgme_data_t sig,
                               gpgme_data_t signed_text,
                               gpgme_data_t plain)
```

`gpgme_op_verify()` expects to be called as follows:

* When it is verifying a detached PGP signature (as is usually the case for `fwupd`):
  + `sig` should be the detached signature
  + `signed_text` should be the data that was signed
  + `plain` should be `NULL`
* When it is verifying a normal or cleartext PGP signature:
  + `sig` should be the normal or cleartext PGP signature
  + `signed_text` should be `NULL`
  + `plain` should be a "writable data object that will contain the plaintext after successful verification"

Though `fwupd` normally uses `gpgme` to verify a **detached** PGP signature,
under adversarial conditions this is not guaranteed - an attacker can provide
any data for the signature file.

`gpgme_op_verify()` exhibits interesting behaviour when given:

* A normal (i.e. **non-detached**) signature as `sig`
* Any data as `signed_text` (which is a hint to `gpgme` that `sig` should be detached)
* Anything as `plain`

Take, as an example, `fwupd` 1.3.9-4 as is currently packaged in Debian Unstable.

If it is given a **detached signature** for which `fwupd` does not know the
signing key, the verification code **correctly rejects** the signature as
follows:

```
    /* verify */
    rc = gpgme_op_verify (self->ctx, sig, data, NULL);
    if (rc != GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR) {
        g_set_error (error,
                 FWUPD_ERROR,
                 FWUPD_ERROR_INTERNAL,
                 "failed to verify data: %s",
                 gpgme_strerror (rc));
        return NULL;
    }

    /* verify the result */
    result = gpgme_op_verify_result (self->ctx);
    if (result == NULL) {
        g_set_error_literal (error,
                     FWUPD_ERROR,
                     FWUPD_ERROR_INTERNAL,
                     "no result record from libgpgme");
        return NULL;
    }

    /*  [+] DEBUG TRACE

        gdb-peda$ print *result

    /* look at each signature */
    for (s = result->signatures; s != NULL ; s = s->next ) {
        g_debug ("returned signature fingerprint %s", s->fpr);
        if (!fu_keyring_gpg_check_signature (s, error))

        if ((gint64) s->timestamp > timestamp_newest) {

            g_string_assign (authority_newest, s->fpr);

    }
    return FU_KEYRING_RESULT (g_object_new (FU_TYPE_KEYRING_RESULT,
                        "timestamp", timestamp_newest,
                        "authority", authority_newest->str,
                        NULL));}
```

The call to `gpgme_op_verify_result()` returns a list of one signature, for
which we can see the summary is `GPGME_SIGSUM_KEY_MISSING` which will make
`fu_keyring_gpg_check_signature()` unhappy in the fine-grained checking `for`
loop.

Compare this to what happens if we give a **non-detached signature** for which
`fwupd` still does not know the signing key. The verification code
**incorrectly accepts** the signature as follows:

```
    /* verify */
    rc = gpgme_op_verify (self->ctx, sig, data, NULL);
    if (rc != GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR) {
        g_set_error (error,
                 FWUPD_ERROR,
                 FWUPD_ERROR_INTERNAL,
                 "failed to verify data: %s",
                 gpgme_strerror (rc));
        return NULL;
    }

    /* verify the result */
    result = gpgme_op_verify_result (self->ctx);
    if (result == NULL) {
        g_set_error_literal (error,
                     FWUPD_ERROR,
                     FWUPD_ERROR_INTERNAL,
                     "no result record from libgpgme");
        return NULL;
    }

    /*  [+] DEBUG TRACE

        gdb-peda$ print *result
        $3 = {
          signatures = 0x0,
          file_name = 0x0,
          is_mime = 0x0,
          _unused = 0x0
        }
    */

    /* look at each signature */
    for (s = result->signatures; s != NULL ; s = s->next ) {
        g_debug ("returned signature fingerprint %s", s->fpr);
        if (!fu_keyring_gpg_check_signature (s, error))
            return NULL;

        /* save details about the key for the result */
        if ((gint64) s->timestamp > timestamp_newest) {
            timestamp_newest = (gint64) s->timestamp;
            g_string_assign (authority_newest, s->fpr);
        }
    }
    return FU_KEYRING_RESULT (g_object_new (FU_TYPE_KEYRING_RESULT,
                        "timestamp", timestamp_newest,
                        "authority", authority_newest->str,
                        NULL));}
```

The call to `gpgme_op_verify_result()` still succeeds but it returns a list of
**zero signatures**.

This will cause the fine-grained checking `for` loop to be bypassed, and so
`fu_keyring_gpg_check_signature()` will not be called at all. The verification
function will incorrectly return a successful result.

### Buggy rollback protection

As an aside, during the disclosure process with the `fwupd` project, it was
noted by the project that rollback/replay protections added in
<https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/commit/f69a4810> should have prevented this
attack from working. In a zero-signature case, such as the case we can trigger,
the verification process will return a default `timestamp` value of 0 to the
calling function, and the calling function *should* reject this value as a
rollback attempt.

However, at
<https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/commit/f69a4810#diff-300ca38c94199c9239dc835920e466ecR1550>
there is a specific carve-out for cases where the verification function returns
a `timestamp` of 0. This defeats the rollback protection for this specific
case.

This is not, strictly speaking, a vulnerability in the rollback protection.
Putting the signature verification bypass aside, for an attacker to attempt a
rollback attack, they will be replaying old metadata signed by LVFS. This
replayed signature will always have a timestamp associated with it, and so an
attacker should not be able to trigger a rollback attack with a malicious
`timestamp` of 0.

This anti-rollback bug was fixed via [fwupd/fwupd#2150](https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/pull/2150)
during the disclosure process. It breaks the exploit described in this
advisory, and probably breaks any exploit targeting this vulnerability.
However, this anti-rollback fix should not be considered to be a root-cause fix
for the bypass vulnerability.

### Proof of Concept - Signature Bypass

This signature bypass can be demonstrated to be exploitable on:

* `fwupd` 0.7.4-2 (As packaged in Debian Stretch which is currently "oldstable")
* `fwupd` 1.3.9-4 (As packaged in Debian Sid "unstable")

To be absolutely clear - this Proof of Concept was **never performed using the
real `lvfsbucket` bucket**. It was done in an offline environment by tweaking
`fwupd` configuration files.

#### The setup

The following Proof of Concept can be executed in a lab by configuring `fwupd`
to point at a server you control. Importantly, `fwupd` will still expect the
metadata to be signed by LVFS. This is understood to be a common deployment
pattern, allowing organisations to host an internal cache of the LVFS
repository while still ensuring that updates are signed by LVFS.

To do so, edit:

* `/etc/fwupd.conf` on legacy versions of `fwupd` (Set the `DownloadURI` value)
* `/etc/fwupd/remotes.d/lvfs.conf` on modern versions of `fwupd` (Set the `MetadataURI` value)

The Proof of Concept uses a Flask app. The source code is available at
<https://github.com/justinsteven/CVE-2020-10759-poc>

The Flask app presents the following endpoints:

* `/detached_unknown_key`
  + `/firmware.xml.gz`
  + `/firmware.xml.gz.asc` - returns a detached PGP signature which is signed by a fresh throwaway PGP key. Causes `fwupd` to throw an error ("No public key available")
* `/detached_bad_signature`
  + `/firmware.xml.gz`
  + `/firmware.xml.gz.asc` - downloads a genuine detached PGP signature from LVFS and returns it. Causes `fwupd` to throw an error ("Invalid signature")
* `/bypass`
  + `/firmware.xml.gz`
  + `/firmware.xml.gz.asc` - returns a regular PGP signature, signed by a fresh throwaway PGP key. Triggers the bypass in `fwupd`, which causes the XML file to be accepted.

In all cases, the `firmware.xml.gz` endpoint returns a dummy XML document.

#### POC: Debian Stretch (currently oldstable)

### Proof of Concept - Actually offering a firmware update

To offer a firmware update, we need to populate `firmware.xml.gz` with metadata entries that:

* Pertain to a hardware device UUID installed on the system
* Advertise a firmware version number greater than the version already installed on the device
* Provide a sane "UpdateProtocol" for the device
* Provide a URL of a `.cab` file and its corresponding cryptographic hash

To do so, two new endpoints were added to the Flask app to dynamically generate
the signed metadata and corresponding `.cab` file:

* `/poc/uuid/<UUID>/version/<VERSION>/updateprotocol/<UPDATE_PROTOCOL>/firmware.xml.gz`
  + Returns XML metadata that advertises a firmware for the given `UUID`, `VERSION` and `UPDATE_PROTOCOL` parameters
* `/poc/uuid/<UUID>/version/<VERSION>/updateprotocol/<UPDATE_PROTOCOL>/poc.cab`
  + Returns a `.cab` file containing an empty firmware file for the given `UUID`, `VERSION` and `UPDATE_PROTOCOL` parameters

On my machine, I found that I could publish an update for my "ThinkPad
Thunderbolt 3 Dock USB Audio" device using the following parameters:

* UUID: 0922fea5-b1c1-5072-bc18-e178bbedce1
* Version: 1.337 (Debian Stretch) or 13-37-00 (Debian Sid)
* Update Protocol: com.synaptics.cxaudio

### Recommended fix

Check that `gpgme_op_verify_result()` returns a `result` with a non-zero number
of signatures.

```
        /* verify the result */
        result = gpgme_op_verify_result (self->ctx);
        if (result == NULL) {
                g_set_error_literal (error,
                                     FWUPD_ERROR,
                                     FWUPD_ERROR_INTERNAL,
                                     "no result record from libgpgme");
                return NULL;
        }

+    /* validate the result */
+    if (result->signatures == NULL) {
+        g_set_error_literal (error,
+                     FWUPD_ERROR,
+                     FWUPD_ERROR_INTERNAL,
+                     "no signatures from libgpgme");
+        return NULL;
+    }

        /* look at each signature */
        for (s = result->signatures; s != NULL ; s = s->next ) {
                g_debug ("returned signature fingerprint %s", s->fpr);
                if (!fu_keyring_gpg_check_signature (s, error))
                        return NULL;

                /* save details about the key for the result */
                if ((gint64) s->timestamp > timestamp_newest) {
                        timestamp_newest = (gint64) s->timestamp;
                        g_string_assign (authority_newest, s->fpr);
```

This fix was adopted in <https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/commit/21f2d12> and
<https://github.com/hughsie/libjcat/commit/839b89f>

It would also be prudent to invert the logic of "looking at each signature".
Currently, the code checks to ensure that there are zero "bad" signatures. It
would be safer to instead ensure that there is at least one "good" signature.

## Vulnerability: Metadata signature verification bypass in `fwupd` >=1.4.0

`fwupd` 1.4.0 switched from using raw PGP signatures to using `jcat` signatures (<https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/commit/d5aab65>)

<https://github.com/hughsie/libjcat> says:

> [libjcat] allows reading and writing gzip-compressed JSON catalog files, which can be used to store GPG, PKCS-7 and SHA-256 checksums for each file.
>
> This provides equivalent functionality to the catalog files supported in Microsoft Windows.

An example decompressed `jcat` document is as follows:

```
% curl -s https://cdn.fwupd.org/downloads/firmware.xml.gz.jcat | zcat | jq .
{
  "JcatVersionMajor": 0,
  "JcatVersionMinor": 1,
  "Items": [
    {
      "Id": "firmware-00550-stable.xml.gz",
      "AliasIds": [
        "firmware.xml.gz"
      ],
      "Blobs": [
        {
          "Kind": 4,
          "Flags": 1,
          "Timestamp": 1590595242,
          "Data": "cf5d00b5c40eacd5985712cf73690798a716a9fe"
        },
        {
          "Kind": 1,
          "Flags": 1,
          "Timestamp": 1590595242,
          "Data": "92248e321551ef3885f432fce942540279b5c624b931b4029a5f9889c8d0452b"
        },
        {
          "Kind": 2,
          "Flags": 1,
          "Timestamp": 1590595243,
          "Data": "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v2.0.22 (GNU/Linux)\n\n[... SNIP PGP signature removed... ]\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n"
        },
        {
          "Kind": 3,
          "Flags": 1,
          "Timestamp": 1590595243,
          "Data": "-----BEGIN PKCS7-----\n[... SNIP PKCS7 signature removed ...]\n-----END PKCS7-----\n"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

That is, a `jcat` document contains:

* Plain cryptographic hashes (e.g. SHA); and
* Signatures (PGP and/or PKCS7)

The PGP signature verification code in `libjcat` was taken directly from
`fwupd` (<https://github.com/hughsie/libjcat/blob/0.1.2/libjcat/jcat-gpg-engine.c#L249-L287>)
and so it inherited the PGP verification bypass vulnerability.

### Proof of Concept

The Flask app was extended to also provide `.jcat` signature documents for each
of the "Unknown Key", "Invalid Signature" and "Bypass" endpoints detailed earlier.

`fwupd` v1.4.1 was installed from source.

```
$ fwupdmgr --version
client version: 1.4.1
compile-time dependency versions
        gusb:   0.3.4
        efivar: 37
daemon version: 1.4.1

```

When the `MetadataURI` setting is pointed at the "Detached Unknown Key"
endpoint, we get a "no signatures supplied" error when refreshing the metadata:

```
$ grep -P '^MetadataURI' /etc/fwupd/remotes.d/lvfs.conf
MetadataURI=http://172.17.24.1:4444/detached_unknown_key/firmware.xml.gz

% fwupdmgr refresh --force

```

When the `MetadataURI` setting is pointed at the "Detached Bad Signature"
endpoint, we get the same error when refreshing the metadata:

```
$ grep -P '^MetadataURI' /etc/fwupd/remotes.d/lvfs.conf
MetadataURI=http://172.17.24.1:4444/detached_bad_signature/firmware.xml.gz

$ fwupdmgr refresh --force

```

Finally, when the `MetadataURI` setting is pointed at the "Bypass" endpoint,
the signature verification succeeds and the XML is honoured. We find that the
XML has been installed in `/var/lib/fwupd/`

```
$ grep -P '^MetadataURI' /etc/fwupd/remotes.d/lvfs.conf

### Recommended Fix

Because the vulnerable code was taken from `fwupd`, the recommended fix is the
same as above.

## Appendix A - Theoretical attack scenarios for the S3 bucket takeover and signature verification bypass

Possible attack scenarios and further research opportunities:

* Redirect clients to a large download (e.g. Operating System ISOs) causing high bandwidth and memory/disk space usage
* Serve to clients the entire script of the Bee Movie
* Redirect clients to cleartext HTTP and serve up EICAR or malware IOC's, triggering IDS systems with false-positives
* Redirect clients from S3 to some dynamic attack infrastructure which could:
  + Proxy through to the genuine LVFS CDN (Doing fixups as needed to have the older clients accept the new metadata)
  + Observe which firmware updates are downloaded from which IP addresses
  + Identify "hot" firmwares for malicious firmware development
  + Inject malicious updates for these firmwares/devices
* Redirect clients to localhost or the internal network, using it as an SSRF primitive
* Audit the codepaths that run as root - the XML/AppStream parsing code; `.cab` parsing code; and firmware flashing code. Vulnerabilities in these codepaths could theoretically lead to RCE as root on legacy `fwupd` clients.

## Appendix B - A PGP Signature Type Primer

PGP, and hence `gnupg`, supports distinct "types" of signatures:

* Normal signatures, in which the data being signed and the signature of the data are both encapsulated in a self-contained machine-readable PGP container
  + You may use just the signature container alone to verify the signature against the embedded data
  + You may use just the signature container alone to retrieve ("decrypt") the original data
* Cleartext signatures, in which the data being signed and the signature of the data are both encapsulated in a self-contained PGP container which is machine-readable, but also human-readable without special software
  + You may use just the signature container alone to verify the signature against the embedded data
  + You may use just the signature container alone to view the original data. It's there in plain sight.
* Detached signatures, in which only the signature of the data is encapsulated in a machine-readable PGP container.
  + You **cannot** use just the signature container alone to verify the signature. You also need a copy of the data as a separate file.
  + You **cannot** use just the signature container alone to read the data that was signed. The data is always in a separate file.

|  | Contains Original Data | Can Validate Signature By Itself |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal Signature | Encoded | Yes |
| Cleartext Signature | Clear Text | Yes |
| Detached Signature | **No** (Separate data file) | **No** (Needs separate data file) |

### Normal signatures

You can produce a normal signature using `gpg --sign`

```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key'

-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----

owEBawGU/pANAwAKAeRlCte1i0n+AcsUYgBeuMkxSGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQqJAUME

-----END PGP MESSAGE-----

```

(Note that the ASCII-armored blob typically starts/ends with "PGP MESSAGE" markers)

You can view the structure of a normal signature using `gpg --list-packets`

```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key' | gpg --list-packets

        data: [2045 bits]

```

(Note that the structure contains both a "literal data packet" and a "signature packet")

You can `--verify` a normal signature using only the signature itself:

```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key' | gpg --verify

gpg: Signature made Mon 11 May 2020 13:40:48 AEST
gpg:                using RSA key F63B8CBFCEE13E057F4B60ABE4650AD7B58B49FE
gpg:                issuer "test@localhost"
gpg: Good signature from "Test Key <test@localhost>" [ultimate]

```

You can retrieve the data embedded within a normal signature itself using `--decrypt`:

```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key' | gpg --decrypt

Hello, world!
gpg: Signature made Mon 11 May 2020 13:40:44 AEST
gpg:                using RSA key F63B8CBFCEE13E057F4B60ABE4650AD7B58B49FE
gpg:                issuer "test@localhost"
gpg: Good signature from "Test Key <test@localhost>" [ultimate]

```

(Note that no actual decryption is happening. Think of it as more of a "decode" operation)

### Cleartext Signatures

You can produce a cleartext signature using `gpg --clear-sign`

```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --clear-sign --local-user 'Test Key'

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Hello, world!
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

iQFDBAEBCgAtFiEE9juMv87hPgV/S2Cr5GUK17WLSf4FAl64z5YPHHRlc3RAbG9j

-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

```

(Note that the output contains both the original data, clearly visible, as well as the signature)

You can `--verify` a cleartext signature using only the signature itself:

```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --clear-sign --local-user 'Test Key' | gpg --verify

gpg: Signature made Mon 11 May 2020 14:19:33 AEST
gpg:                using RSA key F63B8CBFCEE13E057F4B60ABE4650AD7B58B49FE
gpg:                issuer "test@localhost"
gpg: Good signature from "Test Key <test@localhost>" [ultimate]

```

### Detached Signatures

You can produce a detached signature using `gpg --detach-sign`

```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --detach-sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key'

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

iQFDBAABCgAtFiEE9juMv87hPgV/S2Cr5GUK17WLSf4FAl640xcPHHRlc3RAbG9j

-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

```

(Note that the ASCII-armored blob typically starts/ends with "PGP SIGNATURE"
markers, as opposed to the normal signature which typically starts/ends with
"PGP MESSAGE" markers)

You can view the structure of a detached signature using `gpg --list-packets`

```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --detach-sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key' | gpg --list-packets

# off=0 ctb=89 tag=2 hlen=3 plen=323
:signature packet: algo 1, keyid E4650AD7B58B49FE
        version 4, created 1589171067, md5len 0, sigclass 0x00
        digest algo 10, begin of digest cb 02
        hashed subpkt 33 len 21 (issuer fpr v4 F63B8CBFCEE13E057F4B60ABE4650AD7B58B49FE)
        hashed subpkt 2 len 4 (sig created 2020-05-11)
        hashed subpkt 28 len 14 (signer's user ID)
        subpkt 16 len 8 (issuer key ID E4650AD7B58B49FE)
        data: [2043 bits]

```

(Note that the structure contains only a "signature packet". The normal
signature also contained a "literal data packet")

You **cannot** `--verify` a detached signature using only the signature itself:

```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --detach-sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key' | gpg --verify

gpg: no signed data
gpg: can't hash datafile: No data

```

When verifying a detached signature, you must pass two arguments to `--verify`:

* The detached signature file
* The original data file

We can use bash `<(process substitution)` to do so:

```
$ gpg --verify <(echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --detach-sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key') <(echo 'Hello, world!')

gpg: Signature made Mon 11 May 2020 14:28:18 AEST
gpg:                using RSA key F63B8CBFCEE13E057F4B60ABE4650AD7B58B49FE
gpg:                issuer "test@localhost"
gpg: Good signature from "Test Key <test@localhost>" [ultimate]

```

### PGP Signature Type Primer Summary

* Normal/cleartext signatures contain the signature and the original data
* Detached signatures only contain the signature
* Verification of a normal/cleartext signature is done using just **one** argument - `gpg --verify <filename>`
* Verification of a detached signature is done using **two** arguments - `gpg --verify <signature_filename> <original_data_filename>`

## Appendix C - So whose fault was this anyway?

To recap, the `fwupd` signature bypass vulnerability depended on two things:

* The verification pattern in `fwupd` which assumes that if `gpgme_op_verify()` and `gpgme_op_verify_result()` execute successfully, then `gpgme_op_verify_result()` will have returned a non-zero number of signatures that can be examined
* An edge-case in `libgpgme` where doing `gpgme_op_verify()` against a non-detached signature as if it were a detached signature causes a successful verification but with a result of zero signatures

While it can be argued that the verification pattern in `fwupd` is fragile,
what is the root cause? Could the edge-case be handled better in `libgpgme`?
Does it even make sense for a `libgpgme`-based verification to be considered
"successful" if it returns zero signatures?

`libgpgme` essentially wraps the command-line `gnupg` utility. Running `fwupd`
under `strace` and then performing a metadata refresh against the "bypass" POC
endpoint shows some interesting child processes being spawned:

```

```

We see:

* Two invocations of `gpg --import` to import the LVFS PGP public keys. They exited with status 0.
* Two invocations of `gpg --verify`, each one against two file descriptors. They exited with status 2.

The invocations of `gpg --verify` are curious. They specify `--status-fd <n>`
arguments. This is to ask `gpg` to give machine-readable results on a
particular file descriptor, which `libgpgme` would use to get the outcome of
the signature verification.

We can do our own invocations of `gpg --verify` against the real LVFS metadata,
the "invalid key" POC endpoint, the "bad signature" POC endpoint, and the
"bypass" POC endpoint. We can examine the exit code, `--status-fd` and
`--logger-fd` outputs to get an understanding of what `libgpgme` would be seeing.

Results:

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LVFS | 0 | `PROGRESS`, `GOODSIG`, `VALIDSIG` | Key not trusted |
| POC: Unknown Key | 2 | `PROGRESS`, `ERRSIG`, `NO_PUBKEY` | No public key |
| POC: Bad Signature | 1 | `PROGRESS`, `BADSIG` | Bad signature |
| POC: Bypass | 2 | Nothing aside from `PROGRESS` | Not a detached signature |

What is curious is that when attempting to `--validate` the "bypass" data,
`gpg` gives a non-zero exit status and complains loudly to `--logger-fd` about
the input data being invalid ("not a detached signature"). However, there is no
corresponding `--status-fd` machine-readable output to indicate the error or
the presence of any signatures, good or bad. This lack of reporting on
`--status-fd` is a possible cause for why `libgpgme` reports seeing zero
signatures in such a case.

* Should `gpg` complain on `--status-fd` when trying to verify a non-detached signature as if it were detached? Maybe.
* Should `gpgme_op_verify()` notice the non-zero exit status and lack of signatures, and give something **other than** `GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR` to its caller? In my opinion, yes.

And so this could be considered a vulnerability in either `gpg` or `libgpgme`.

During the disclosure process, I contacted security@gnupg.org. The developers
on duty decided that this would not be handled as a vulnerability.

Developers who use `libgpgme` should take note and ensure that their signature
verification logic defends against a zero-signature result.

Update 10 June 2020: GnuPG have updated their documentation following the
disclosure of this issue. See
<https://dev.gnupg.org/rM88f3202521d422d94bfd79e61bde00707d6f28c9>

# Legacy LVFS S3 bucket takeover and CVE-2020-10759 fwupd signature verification bypass
There were two distinct vulnerabilities:
\* A \*\*dangling S3 bucket\*\* that belonged to LVFS (Linux Vendor Firmware Service). The dangling bucket is referenced by the default configuration in `fwupd` version <1.0.6 (Released 2018)
\* A \*\*PGP signature verification bypass\*\* in all versions of `fwupd` (CVE-2020-10759)
Taken together, these vulnerabilities would have allowed an attacker who
claimed the S3 bucket to \*\*offer malicious firmware updates to Linux desktops
and servers running legacy versions of `fwupd`\*\*.
![Debian Stretch gnome-software showing a malicious firmware update](images/2020\_fwupd\_dangling\_s3\_bucket\_and\_signature\_verification\_bypass/debian\_stretch\_gnomesoftware\_fwupd\_malicious\_update.png)
The dangling bucket has been transferred to the control of the LVFS team.
The PGP verification bypass existed in versions of `fwupd` prior to 1.4.0, and
in `libjcat` used by `fwupd` from 1.4.0 onwards. The vulnerability can be fixed
in `fwupd` prior to 1.4.0 by backporting
, and in `fwupd` from 1.4.0
onwards by using a `libjcat` that includes
## Impact of the dangling S3 bucket and signature verification bypass vulnerability
Although the dangling S3 bucket only affected `fwupd` clients with a legacy
configuration, there is a large install base of these clients. For example,
Debian Stretch (currently "oldstable") still ships a version that references
the bucket. Over the course of 26 days, the S3 bucket received more than \*\*2.5
million update requests\*\* from over \*\*500,000 unique IP addresses\*\*.
The following graph shows the average number of update requests seen per hour, per week.
![graph showing unique ip addresses seen per hour](images/2020\_fwupd\_dangling\_s3\_bucket\_and\_signature\_verification\_bypass/traffic\_hits\_per\_hour.png)
The following graph shows the total number of update requests seen per day.
![graph showing unique ip addresses seen per day](images/2020\_fwupd\_dangling\_s3\_bucket\_and\_signature\_verification\_bypass/traffic\_hits\_per\_day.png)
`gnome-software` typically refreshes `fwupd` data once per day, which is
reflected by the 24-hour cyclical traffic pattern in the first graph. The
number of daily update requests in the second graph is ~100,000 excluding
weekends, and so I estimate that there are \*\*at least 100,000 unique `fwupd`
clients reaching out to the dangling S3 bucket\*\*.
Notwithstanding the dangling S3 bucket issue, the signature bypass
vulnerability would also have been exploitable by an attacker who:
\* Can compromise HTTPS connections to a `fwupd` metadata repository; or
\* Is in a privileged position within a public `fwupd` metadata repository (such as LVFS); or
\* Is in a privileged position within a local metadata mirror (such as one belonging to an enterprise)
## Limitations of the vulnerabilities
Some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), reportedly
do not ship with a configuration that includes the LVFS metadata repository.
`fwupd` does not install firmware updates for users automatically - the user
must manually accept the updates.
Firmware installation can only be done using prescribed protocols implemented
within `fwupd` itself. It is not possible for an update to execute custom code,
such as a proprietary flasher utility, during firmware installation. However,
the vulnerabilities do give the ability to provide malicious input to an XML
parser and `.cab` file parser which run as root. These code paths were not
thoroughly examined.
Some hardware devices perform their own on-chip verification of firmware
updates (based on a key held by the hardware vendor themselves) which could
prevent the installation of some malicious firmware images.
## Timeline of events
\* April 2015 - `fwupd` 0.1.2 is released; includes the commit which introduces the PGP signature verification bypass vulnerability ()
\* August 2016 - `fwupd` 0.7.3 is released; includes the commit which instructs client machines to download firmware metadata from the `lvfsbucket` S3 bucket ()
\* March 2018 - `fwupd` 1.0.6 is released; includes the commit which instructs client machines to move away from the `lvfsbucket` S3 bucket ()
\* November 2018 - reports emerge that the `lvfsbucket` S3 bucket is returning 404 "file not found" errors ()
\* November 2019 - This is when the LVFS project claims that the S3 bucket was deleted
\* April 2020 - `fwupd` 1.4.0 is released; includes the commit which moves away from PGP signatures in favour of `jcat` signatures ()
\* May 2020 - I registered the dangling `lvfsbucket` S3 bucket

## What is LVFS?
LVFS (Linux Vendor Firmware Service) is:
> a secure portal which allows hardware vendors to upload firmware updates.
> \[The\] site is used by all major Linux distributions to provide metadata for
> clients such as fwupdmgr and GNOME Software.
()
The LVFS is a metadata repository. It contains:
\* Descriptions of hardware, the firmware of which can be updated
\* URLs of firmware update files (.cab files) which may be hosted either directly on LVFS or on a third-party website
\* Cryptographic hashes of the .cab files
See  for an example of a metadata entry.
The metadata is published as a file named `firmware.xml.gz`. This file can be
verified using a detached PGP signature produced using the LVFS PGP key
(`0x48A6D80E4538BAC2`) or a "jcat" bundle of signatures (PGP and PKCS7) which
will be described later in this advisory.
 and
 give excellent background on the LVFS project.
## What is fwupd?
`fwupd` is:
> a simple daemon to allow session software to update device firmware on your
> local machine. It's designed for desktops, but also usable on phones and
> headless servers. You can either use a GUI software manager like GNOME
> Software to view and apply updates, the command-line tool or the system D-Bus
> interface directly.
()
`fwupd` is responsible for:
\* Checking the PGP (`fwupd` <1.4.0) or jcat (`fwupd` >=1.4.0) signature of the firmware metadata from repositories such as LVFS
\* Parsing the XML/AppStream firmware metadata
\* Informing the user of firmware updates described in the metadata that are available for their hardware, such as BIOS or Thunderbolt controller updates
\* Downloading, unpacking and flashing the firmware updates when requested by the user
The firmware installation occurs over a limited number of protocols implemented
within `fwupd`, such as DFU or Fastboot
(). Importantly, it is not
possible for an individual firmware update to run custom code on the user's
machine, such as a proprietary flasher utility.
## What is the LVFS/`fwupd` data flow and security model?
In a nutshell, the data flow and security model appears to be as follows:
1. Within LVFS
1. Firmware vendors apply to LVFS and are granted permission to upload firmware metadata for certain hardware `vendor-id` value/s ()
2. Firmware vendors submit Firmware metadata and .cab files to LVFS
3. LVFS collates the metadata for all vendors into one file (`firmware.xml.gz`) which includes cryptographic hashes of each .cab file
4. LVFS signs this file to produce a detached PGP signature (`firmware.xml.gz.asc`) and jcat (PGP && PKCS7) signature (`firmware.xml.gz.jcat`)
2. On client machines
1. `fwupdmgr` or `gnome-software` run as non-root \*client utilities\*
2. `fwupd` runs as a root system service
3. The \*client utility\* periodically downloads:
\* The `firmware.xml.gz` file, as well as:
\* `fwupd` <1.4.0 - `firmware.xml.gz.asc` (e.g. )
\* `fwupd` >= 1.4.0 - `firmware.xml.gz.jcat` (e.g. )
4. The \*client utility\* sends the file descriptor of each file to `fwupd` via D-Bus to do an "UpdateMetadata" operation (e.g. )
5. `fwupd` checks the detached PGP (e.g. https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/blob/1.3.9/src/fu-keyring-gpg.c#L279-L316) or jcat signature
\* \*\*This establishes the anchor of trust\*\*. The metadata contains cryptographic hashes (e.g. SHA) of individual firmware updates, and the metadata as a whole is signed by LVFS. This pattern (Signed metadata containing individual checksums) is similar to the `apt` model ()
6. Assuming the signature verification succeeds, `fwupd` parses the XML metadata using "a subset of the AppStream component specification" ()
7. `fwupd` scans the system's connected devices and considers the firmware updates available from LVFS
8. `fwupd` notifies the \*client utility\* of available firmware updates for the system's connected devices
9. The user chooses to install the firmware updates via the \*client utility\*
10. The \*client utility\* downloads the .cab file
10. `fwupd` verifies the .cab file's cryptographic hash against the hash in `firmware.xml.gz`, unpacks it, and flashes the firmware
To put it another way:
\* `firmware.xml.gz` is signed as `firmware.xml.gz.asc` or `firmware.xml.gz.jcat`
\* `firmware.xml.gz` describes the updates available for various hardware devices, provides a download URL for each update (`.cab` file), and provides cryptographic hashes of the `.cab` files
\* The firmware `.cab` files contain flashable firmware update files
\* If a firmware `.cab` file's hash matches the hash listed in `firmware.xml.gz`, and the signature of `firmware.xml.gz` is correct, then the `.cab` file can be considered trustworthy
For more information on this security model, see

Consider the case in which an attacker controls the contents of
`firmware.xml.gz`, and can sign the file or bypass the signature verification
process. The attacker could advertise malicious firmware updates for various
hardware products. If a user chooses to install a malicious update, the
attacker could compromise the user's hardware, violating the integrity of the
user's system.
## Vulnerability: Legacy LVFS S3 bucket takeover (https://s3.amazonaws.com/lvfsbucket/)
Releases of `fwupd` ship with URLs of firmware repositories, such as LVFS.
These are the URLs from which information about firmware updates should be
downloaded.
\* From version 0.7.3 to 1.0.5, the LVFS URL was
\* From version 1.0.6 onwards, the LVFS URL was changed to
This change occurred in commit
(28 February 2018) to allow the LVFS project to move from Amazon S3 to an
alternative CDN.
Some Linux distributions (e.g. Red Hat Enterprise Linux) reportedly do not ship
`fwupd` configured to use the LVFS metadata URL.
It was reported to the project in November 2018
() that downloads from the old URL
were failing with 404 errors. The project's solution was for users to update
`fwupd`; or nag their distro to backport a fix. A bug against Debian Stretch
(which is currently "oldstable") was opened in October 2018 at
 and is unresolved at
the time of writing.
After the migration away from the Amazon S3 hosting arrangement, the LVFS
project \*\*deleted the `lvfsbucket` S3 bucket\*\*. The LVFS project informed me
during the disclosure process that the S3 bucket was deleted in \*\*November
2019\*\*.
I observed the following in May 2020:
```
$ curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/lvfsbucket/downloads/firmware.xml.gz.asc
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?
`NoSuchBucket`The specified bucket does not existlvfsbucket [... SNIP ...]
```
With the bucket having been deleted, it was free for registration by any Amazon
AWS customer. The user who registered the bucket would then \*\*receive the
phone-home update requests from users running legacy `fwupd` clients\*\*.
I registered the bucket in May 2020, and enabled S3 access logging on the
bucket ()
Over the course of 26 days, the S3 bucket received more than \*\*2.5 million
update requests\*\* from over \*\*500,000 unique IP addresses\*\*.
Note that, during the time in which the I controlled the S3 bucket, \*\*no
content was published from the bucket\*\*. The bucket returned "403 Forbidden"
for every request made to it.
Control of the bucket gives us the following primitives:
\* We can provide arbitrary `firmware.xml.gz` metadata files to legacy `fwupd` clients
\* We can provide arbitrary `firmware.xml.gz.asc` signature files to legacy `fwupd` clients
To make use of these primitives, we would need to sign `firmware.xml.gz` using
a trusted LVFS key; or we would need a way to bypass the PGP signature checking
in `fwupd`.
### Recommended Fix
The dangling S3 bucket has been transferred to the LVFS project. The LVFS
project should maintain control of this bucket until legacy versions of `fwupd`
are no longer installed in the field. The bucket should not be deleted until it
is safe to do so.
## Vulnerability: Metadata signature verification bypass in `fwupd` <1.4.0
The PGP-based metadata signature verification in `fwupd` <1.4.0 is
vulnerable and can be reliably bypassed. Any \*\*non-detached\*\* signature signed
by \*\*any key\*\* will defeat the verification logic.
Given this vulnerability, an attacker who claimed the above dangling S3 bucket,
or can otherwise put themselves between `fwupd` clients and a metadata
repository, could have provided signed malicious firmware update information to
`fwupd` clients.
The vulnerability relies on the difference between detached and non-detached
PGP signatures. A primer on PGP signature types is provided in Appendix A.
To be taken as an example, the signature verification code is as follows in
`fwupd` 1.3.9
```c
/\* load file data \*/
// [SNIP - read the metadata data into 'data']
// [SNIP - read the metadata signature into 'sig']
/\* verify \*/
rc = gpgme\_op\_verify (self->ctx, sig, data, NULL);
if (rc != GPG\_ERR\_NO\_ERROR) {
g\_set\_error (error,
FWUPD\_ERROR,
FWUPD\_ERROR\_INTERNAL,
"failed to verify data: %s",
gpgme\_strerror (rc));
return NULL;
}
/\* verify the result \*/
result = gpgme\_op\_verify\_result (self->ctx);
if (result == NULL) {
g\_set\_error\_literal (error,
FWUPD\_ERROR,
FWUPD\_ERROR\_INTERNAL,
"no result record from libgpgme");
return NULL;
}
/\* look at each signature \*/
for (s = result->signatures; s != NULL ; s = s->next ) {
g\_debug ("returned signature fingerprint %s", s->fpr);
if (!fu\_keyring\_gpg\_check\_signature (s, error))
return NULL;
/\* save details about the key for the result \*/
if ((gint64) s->timestamp > timestamp\_newest) {
timestamp\_newest = (gint64) s->timestamp;
g\_string\_assign (authority\_newest, s->fpr);
}
}
return FU\_KEYRING\_RESULT (g\_object\_new (FU\_TYPE\_KEYRING\_RESULT,
"timestamp", timestamp\_newest,
"authority", authority\_newest->str,
NULL));}
```
()
Though this code has changed over time, all versions follow the same general
pattern.
The verification flow is as follows:
1. The signature verification is done by `gpgme\_op\_verify()` which is provided by `libgpgme` and is documented at
\* If `rc = gpgme\_op\_verify()` fails (i.e. doesn't return `GPG\_ERR\_NO\_ERROR`) the verification is \*\*failed\*\*
2. Details about the verification are fetched using `gpgme\_op\_verify\_result()`
\* If `result = gpgme\_op\_verify\_result()` fails (i.e. returns `NULL`) the verification is \*\*failed\*\*
3. The signatures within `result` are looped over.
\* For each signature, if `fu\_keyring\_gpg\_check\_signature()` is unhappy (e.g. the public key was unknown; the signature was bad; the signing key is expired) the verification is \*\*failed\*\*
4. If we get this far, the verification is considered successful
This is arguably a fragile design. A potential attack vector would be to:
\* Provide some `data` (xml) and `sig` (asc) data which:
\* Causes `gpgme\_op\_verify()` (step 1 above) to succeed; and
\* Causes `gpgme\_op\_verify\_result()` (step 2 above) to succeed and to return a `result` with zero signatures
\* Due to the fact that there are zero signatures, the `for` loop (step 3 above) will be skipped entirely, and so `fu\_keyring\_gpg\_check\_signature()` will not be called, which allows us to skip the fine-grained signature checking
\* The function will return "Verification successful" (step 4 above)
We are able to execute this attack due to an edge-case in GPGme (GnuPG Made
Easy) when it tries to verify a normal signature as if it were a detached
signature.
A more robust design would be to:
\* Explicitly check that `result->signatures` is non-zero (i.e. at least one signature was observed by `gpgme\_op\_verify()`); and/or
\* Invert the individual signature verification logic. Currently, the code checks to ensure that there are zero "bad" signatures. It would be safer to instead ensure that there is at least one "good" signature. This is the approach taken by `flatpak` )
### GPGme (GnuPG Made Easy)
GPGme is provided by the GnuPG project. It is a library that wraps the `gpg`
command-line utility and exposes GnuPG functionality to software developers.
`fwupd` uses two GPGme functions:
\* `gpgme\_op\_verify()` which performs GnuPG signature verification
\* `gpgme\_op\_verify\_result()` which exposes information about a signature verification
The function signature of `gpgme\_op\_verify()` is as follows:
```c
gpgme\_error\_t gpgme\_op\_verify (gpgme\_ctx\_t ctx,
gpgme\_data\_t sig,
gpgme\_data\_t signed\_text,
gpgme\_data\_t plain)
```
`gpgme\_op\_verify()` expects to be called as follows:
\* When it is verifying a detached PGP signature (as is usually the case for `fwupd`):
\* `sig` should be the detached signature
\* `signed\_text` should be the data that was signed
\* `plain` should be `NULL`
\* When it is verifying a normal or cleartext PGP signature:
\* `sig` should be the normal or cleartext PGP signature
\* `signed\_text` should be `NULL`
\* `plain` should be a "writable data object that will contain the plaintext after successful verification"
Though `fwupd` normally uses `gpgme` to verify a \*\*detached\*\* PGP signature,
under adversarial conditions this is not guaranteed - an attacker can provide
any data for the signature file.
`gpgme\_op\_verify()` exhibits interesting behaviour when given:
\* A normal (i.e. \*\*non-detached\*\*) signature as `sig`
\* Any data as `signed\_text` (which is a hint to `gpgme` that `sig` should be detached)
\* Anything as `plain`
Take, as an example, `fwupd` 1.3.9-4 as is currently packaged in Debian Unstable.
If it is given a \*\*detached signature\*\* for which `fwupd` does not know the
signing key, the verification code \*\*correctly rejects\*\* the signature as
follows:
```c
/\* verify \*/
rc = gpgme\_op\_verify (self->ctx, sig, data, NULL);
if (rc != GPG\_ERR\_NO\_ERROR) {
g\_set\_error (error,
FWUPD\_ERROR,
FWUPD\_ERROR\_INTERNAL,
"failed to verify data: %s",
gpgme\_strerror (rc));
return NULL;
}
/\* verify the result \*/
result = gpgme\_op\_verify\_result (self->ctx);
if (result == NULL) {
g\_set\_error\_literal (error,
FWUPD\_ERROR,
FWUPD\_ERROR\_INTERNAL,
"no result record from libgpgme");
return NULL;
}

for (s = result->signatures; s != NULL ; s = s->next ) {
g\_debug ("returned signature fingerprint %s", s->fpr);
if (!fu\_keyring\_gpg\_check\_signature (s, error))
return NULL;
/\* save details about the key for the result \*/
if ((gint64) s->timestamp > timestamp\_newest) {
timestamp\_newest = (gint64) s->timestamp;
g\_string\_assign (authority\_newest, s->fpr);
}
}
return FU\_KEYRING\_RESULT (g\_object\_new (FU\_TYPE\_KEYRING\_RESULT,
"timestamp", timestamp\_newest,
"authority", authority\_newest->str,
NULL));}
```
The call to `gpgme\_op\_verify\_result()` returns a list of one signature, for
which we can see the summary is `GPGME\_SIGSUM\_KEY\_MISSING` which will make
`fu\_keyring\_gpg\_check\_signature()` unhappy in the fine-grained checking `for`
loop.
Compare this to what happens if we give a \*\*non-detached signature\*\* for which
`fwupd` still does not know the signing key. The verification code
\*\*incorrectly accepts\*\* the signature as follows:
```c
/\* verify \*/
rc = gpgme\_op\_verify (self->ctx, sig, data, NULL);
if (rc != GPG\_ERR\_NO\_ERROR) {
g\_set\_error (error,
FWUPD\_ERROR,
FWUPD\_ERROR\_INTERNAL,
"failed to verify data: %s",
gpgme\_strerror (rc));
return NULL;
}
/\* verify the result \*/
result = gpgme\_op\_verify\_result (self->ctx);
if (result == NULL) {
g\_set\_error\_literal (error,
FWUPD\_ERROR,
FWUPD\_ERROR\_INTERNAL,
"no result record from libgpgme");
return NULL;
}
/\* [+] DEBUG TRACE
gdb-peda$ print \*result
$3 = {
signatures = 0x0,
file\_name = 0x0,
is\_mime = 0x0,
\_unused = 0x0
}
\*/
/\* look at each signature \*/
for (s = result->signatures; s != NULL ; s = s->next ) {
g\_debug ("returned signature fingerprint %s", s->fpr);
if (!fu\_keyring\_gpg\_check\_signature (s, error))
return NULL;
/\* save details about the key for the result \*/
if ((gint64) s->timestamp > timestamp\_newest) {
timestamp\_newest = (gint64) s->timestamp;
g\_string\_assign (authority\_newest, s->fpr);
}
}
return FU\_KEYRING\_RESULT (g\_object\_new (FU\_TYPE\_KEYRING\_RESULT,
"timestamp", timestamp\_newest,
"authority", authority\_newest->str,
NULL));}
```
The call to `gpgme\_op\_verify\_result()` still succeeds but it returns a list of
\*\*zero signatures\*\*.
This will cause the fine-grained checking `for` loop to be bypassed, and so
`fu\_keyring\_gpg\_check\_signature()` will not be called at all. The verification
function will incorrectly return a successful result.
### Buggy rollback protection
As an aside, during the disclosure process with the `fwupd` project, it was
noted by the project that rollback/replay protections added in
 should have prevented this
attack from working. In a zero-signature case, such as the case we can trigger,
the verification process will return a default `timestamp` value of 0 to the
calling function, and the calling function \*should\* reject this value as a
rollback attempt.
However, at
there is a specific carve-out for cases where the verification function returns
a `timestamp` of 0. This defeats the rollback protection for this specific
case.
This is not, strictly speaking, a vulnerability in the rollback protection.
Putting the signature verification bypass aside, for an attacker to attempt a
rollback attack, they will be replaying old metadata signed by LVFS. This
replayed signature will always have a timestamp associated with it, and so an
attacker should not be able to trigger a rollback attack with a malicious
`timestamp` of 0.
This anti-rollback bug was fixed via
during the disclosure process. It breaks the exploit described in this
advisory, and probably breaks any exploit targeting this vulnerability.
However, this anti-rollback fix should not be considered to be a root-cause fix
for the bypass vulnerability.
### Proof of Concept - Signature Bypass
This signature bypass can be demonstrated to be exploitable on:
\* `fwupd` 0.7.4-2 (As packaged in Debian Stretch which is currently "oldstable")
\* `fwupd` 1.3.9-4 (As packaged in Debian Sid "unstable")
To be absolutely clear - this Proof of Concept was \*\*never performed using the
real `lvfsbucket` bucket\*\*. It was done in an offline environment by tweaking
`fwupd` configuration files.
#### The setup
The following Proof of Concept can be executed in a lab by configuring `fwupd`
to point at a server you control. Importantly, `fwupd` will still expect the
metadata to be signed by LVFS. This is understood to be a common deployment
pattern, allowing organisations to host an internal cache of the LVFS
repository while still ensuring that updates are signed by LVFS.
To do so, edit:
\* `/etc/fwupd.conf` on legacy versions of `fwupd` (Set the `DownloadURI` value)
\* `/etc/fwupd/remotes.d/lvfs.conf` on modern versions of `fwupd` (Set the `MetadataURI` value)
The Proof of Concept uses a Flask app. The source code is available at
The Flask app presents the following endpoints:
\* `/detached\_unknown\_key`
\* `/firmware.xml.gz`
\* `/firmware.xml.gz.asc` - returns a detached PGP signature which is signed by a fresh throwaway PGP key. Causes `fwupd` to throw an error ("No public key available")
\* `/detached\_bad\_signature`
\* `/firmware.xml.gz`
\* `/firmware.xml.gz.asc` - downloads a genuine detached PGP signature from LVFS and returns it. Causes `fwupd` to throw an error ("Invalid signature")
\* `/bypass`
\* `/firmware.xml.gz`
\* `/firmware.xml.gz.asc` - returns a regular PGP signature, signed by a fresh throwaway PGP key. Triggers the bypass in `fwupd`, which causes the XML file to be accepted.
In all cases, the `firmware.xml.gz` endpoint returns a dummy XML document.
#### POC: Debian Stretch (currently oldstable)
`fwupd` v0.7.4-2 is installed. By default it points at the dangling S3 bucket.

### Proof of Concept - Actually offering a firmware update
To offer a firmware update, we need to populate `firmware.xml.gz` with metadata entries that:
\* Pertain to a hardware device UUID installed on the system
\* Advertise a firmware version number greater than the version already installed on the device
\* Provide a sane "UpdateProtocol" for the device
\* Provide a URL of a `.cab` file and its corresponding cryptographic hash
To do so, two new endpoints were added to the Flask app to dynamically generate
the signed metadata and corresponding `.cab` file:
\* `/poc/uuid//version//updateprotocol//firmware.xml.gz`
\* Returns XML metadata that advertises a firmware for the given `UUID`, `VERSION` and `UPDATE\_PROTOCOL` parameters
\* `/poc/uuid//version//updateprotocol//poc.cab`
\* Returns a `.cab` file containing an empty firmware file for the given `UUID`, `VERSION` and `UPDATE\_PROTOCOL` parameters
On my machine, I found that I could publish an update for my "ThinkPad
Thunderbolt 3 Dock USB Audio" device using the following parameters:
\* UUID: 0922fea5-b1c1-5072-bc18-e178bbedce1
\* Version: 1.337 (Debian Stretch) or 13-37-00 (Debian Sid)
\* Update Protocol: com.synaptics.cxaudio

### Recommended fix
Check that `gpgme\_op\_verify\_result()` returns a `result` with a non-zero number
of signatures.
```diff
/\* verify the result \*/
result = gpgme\_op\_verify\_result (self->ctx);
if (result == NULL) {
g\_set\_error\_literal (error,
FWUPD\_ERROR,
FWUPD\_ERROR\_INTERNAL,
"no result record from libgpgme");
return NULL;
}
+ /\* validate the result \*/
+ if (result->signatures == NULL) {
+ g\_set\_error\_literal (error,
+ FWUPD\_ERROR,
+ FWUPD\_ERROR\_INTERNAL,
+ "no signatures from libgpgme");
+ return NULL;
+ }
/\* look at each signature \*/
for (s = result->signatures; s != NULL ; s = s->next ) {
g\_debug ("returned signature fingerprint %s", s->fpr);
if (!fu\_keyring\_gpg\_check\_signature (s, error))
return NULL;
/\* save details about the key for the result \*/
if ((gint64) s->timestamp > timestamp\_newest) {
timestamp\_newest = (gint64) s->timestamp;
g\_string\_assign (authority\_newest, s->fpr);
```
This fix was adopted in  and
It would also be prudent to invert the logic of "looking at each signature".
Currently, the code checks to ensure that there are zero "bad" signatures. It
would be safer to instead ensure that there is at least one "good" signature.
## Vulnerability: Metadata signature verification bypass in `fwupd` >=1.4.0
`fwupd` 1.4.0 switched from using raw PGP signatures to using `jcat` signatures ()
 says:
> \[libjcat\] allows reading and writing gzip-compressed JSON catalog files, which can be used to store GPG, PKCS-7 and SHA-256 checksums for each file.
>
> This provides equivalent functionality to the catalog files supported in Microsoft Windows.
An example decompressed `jcat` document is as follows:
```
% curl -s https://cdn.fwupd.org/downloads/firmware.xml.gz.jcat | zcat | jq .
{
"JcatVersionMajor": 0,
"JcatVersionMinor": 1,
"Items": [
{
"Id": "firmware-00550-stable.xml.gz",
"AliasIds": [
"firmware.xml.gz"
],
"Blobs": [
{
"Kind": 4,
"Flags": 1,
"Timestamp": 1590595242,
"Data": "cf5d00b5c40eacd5985712cf73690798a716a9fe"
},
{

},
{
"Kind": 2,
"Flags": 1,
"Timestamp": 1590595243,
"Data": "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v2.0.22 (GNU/Linux)\n\n[... SNIP PGP signature removed... ]\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n"
},
{
"Kind": 3,
"Flags": 1,
"Timestamp": 1590595243,
"Data": "-----BEGIN PKCS7-----\n[... SNIP PKCS7 signature removed ...]\n-----END PKCS7-----\n"
}
]
}
]
}
```
That is, a `jcat` document contains:
\* Plain cryptographic hashes (e.g. SHA); and
\* Signatures (PGP and/or PKCS7)
The PGP signature verification code in `libjcat` was taken directly from
`fwupd` ()
and so it inherited the PGP verification bypass vulnerability.
### Proof of Concept
The Flask app was extended to also provide `.jcat` signature documents for each
of the "Unknown Key", "Invalid Signature" and "Bypass" endpoints detailed earlier.
`fwupd` v1.4.1 was installed from source.
```
$ fwupdmgr --version
client version: 1.4.1
compile-time dependency versions
gusb: 0.3.4
efivar: 37
daemon version: 1.4.1
```
When the `MetadataURI` setting is pointed at the "Detached Unknown Key"
endpoint, we get a "no signatures supplied" error when refreshing the metadata:
```
$ grep -P '^MetadataURI' /etc/fwupd/remotes.d/lvfs.conf
MetadataURI=http://172.17.24.1:4444/detached\_unknown\_key/firmware.xml.gz
% fwupdmgr refresh --force

```
When the `MetadataURI` setting is pointed at the "Detached Bad Signature"
endpoint, we get the same error when refreshing the metadata:
```
$ grep -P '^MetadataURI' /etc/fwupd/remotes.d/lvfs.conf
MetadataURI=http://172.17.24.1:4444/detached\_bad\_signature/firmware.xml.gz
$ fwupdmgr refresh --force

Failed to update metadata for lvfs: signatures were required, but none supplied
```
Finally, when the `MetadataURI` setting is pointed at the "Bypass" endpoint,
the signature verification succeeds and the XML is honoured. We find that the
XML has been installed in `/var/lib/fwupd/`
```
$ grep -P '^MetadataURI' /etc/fwupd/remotes.d/lvfs.conf

### Recommended Fix
Because the vulnerable code was taken from `fwupd`, the recommended fix is the
same as above.
## Appendix A - Theoretical attack scenarios for the S3 bucket takeover and signature verification bypass
Possible attack scenarios and further research opportunities:
\* Redirect clients to a large download (e.g. Operating System ISOs) causing high bandwidth and memory/disk space usage
\* Serve to clients the entire script of the Bee Movie
\* Redirect clients to cleartext HTTP and serve up EICAR or malware IOC's, triggering IDS systems with false-positives
\* Redirect clients from S3 to some dynamic attack infrastructure which could:
\* Proxy through to the genuine LVFS CDN (Doing fixups as needed to have the older clients accept the new metadata)
\* Observe which firmware updates are downloaded from which IP addresses
\* Identify "hot" firmwares for malicious firmware development
\* Inject malicious updates for these firmwares/devices
\* Redirect clients to localhost or the internal network, using it as an SSRF primitive
\* Audit the codepaths that run as root - the XML/AppStream parsing code; `.cab` parsing code; and firmware flashing code. Vulnerabilities in these codepaths could theoretically lead to RCE as root on legacy `fwupd` clients.
## Appendix B - A PGP Signature Type Primer
PGP, and hence `gnupg`, supports distinct "types" of signatures:
\* Normal signatures, in which the data being signed and the signature of the data are both encapsulated in a self-contained machine-readable PGP container
\* You may use just the signature container alone to verify the signature against the embedded data
\* You may use just the signature container alone to retrieve ("decrypt") the original data
\* Cleartext signatures, in which the data being signed and the signature of the data are both encapsulated in a self-contained PGP container which is machine-readable, but also human-readable without special software
\* You may use just the signature container alone to verify the signature against the embedded data
\* You may use just the signature container alone to view the original data. It's there in plain sight.
\* Detached signatures, in which only the signature of the data is encapsulated in a machine-readable PGP container.
\* You \*\*cannot\*\* use just the signature container alone to verify the signature. You also need a copy of the data as a separate file.
\* You \*\*cannot\*\* use just the signature container alone to read the data that was signed. The data is always in a separate file.
| | Contains Original Data | Can Validate Signature By Itself |
| -------------------- |:---------------------------:| :--------------------------------:|
| Normal Signature | Encoded | Yes |
| Cleartext Signature | Clear Text | Yes |
| Detached Signature | \*\*No\*\* (Separate data file) | \*\*No\*\* (Needs separate data file) |
### Normal signatures
You can produce a normal signature using `gpg --sign`
```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key'
-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----

-----END PGP MESSAGE-----
```
(Note that the ASCII-armored blob typically starts/ends with "PGP MESSAGE" markers)
You can view the structure of a normal signature using `gpg --list-packets`
```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key' | gpg --list-packets
# off=0 ctb=a3 tag=8 hlen=1 plen=0 indeterminate

subpkt 16 len 8 (issuer key ID E4650AD7B58B49FE)
data: [2045 bits]
```
(Note that the structure contains both a "literal data packet" and a "signature packet")
You can `--verify` a normal signature using only the signature itself:
```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key' | gpg --verify
gpg: Signature made Mon 11 May 2020 13:40:48 AEST
gpg: using RSA key F63B8CBFCEE13E057F4B60ABE4650AD7B58B49FE
gpg: issuer "test@localhost"
gpg: Good signature from "Test Key " [ultimate]
```
You can retrieve the data embedded within a normal signature itself using `--decrypt`:
```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key' | gpg --decrypt
Hello, world!
gpg: Signature made Mon 11 May 2020 13:40:44 AEST
gpg: using RSA key F63B8CBFCEE13E057F4B60ABE4650AD7B58B49FE
gpg: issuer "test@localhost"
gpg: Good signature from "Test Key " [ultimate]
```
(Note that no actual decryption is happening. Think of it as more of a "decode" operation)
### Cleartext Signatures
You can produce a cleartext signature using `gpg --clear-sign`
```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --clear-sign --local-user 'Test Key'
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
```
(Note that the output contains both the original data, clearly visible, as well as the signature)
You can `--verify` a cleartext signature using only the signature itself:
```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --clear-sign --local-user 'Test Key' | gpg --verify
gpg: Signature made Mon 11 May 2020 14:19:33 AEST
gpg: using RSA key F63B8CBFCEE13E057F4B60ABE4650AD7B58B49FE
gpg: issuer "test@localhost"
gpg: Good signature from "Test Key " [ultimate]
```
### Detached Signatures
You can produce a detached signature using `gpg --detach-sign`
```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --detach-sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key'
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
```
(Note that the ASCII-armored blob typically starts/ends with "PGP SIGNATURE"
markers, as opposed to the normal signature which typically starts/ends with
"PGP MESSAGE" markers)
You can view the structure of a detached signature using `gpg --list-packets`
```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --detach-sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key' | gpg --list-packets
# off=0 ctb=89 tag=2 hlen=3 plen=323
:signature packet: algo 1, keyid E4650AD7B58B49FE

hashed subpkt 28 len 14 (signer's user ID)
subpkt 16 len 8 (issuer key ID E4650AD7B58B49FE)
data: [2043 bits]
```
(Note that the structure contains only a "signature packet". The normal
signature also contained a "literal data packet")
You \*\*cannot\*\* `--verify` a detached signature using only the signature itself:
```
$ echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --detach-sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key' | gpg --verify
gpg: no signed data
gpg: can't hash datafile: No data
```
When verifying a detached signature, you must pass two arguments to `--verify`:
\* The detached signature file
\* The original data file
We can use bash `<(process substitution)` to do so:
```
$ gpg --verify <(echo 'Hello, world!' | gpg --detach-sign --armor --local-user 'Test Key') <(echo 'Hello, world!')
gpg: Signature made Mon 11 May 2020 14:28:18 AEST
gpg: using RSA key F63B8CBFCEE13E057F4B60ABE4650AD7B58B49FE
gpg: issuer "test@localhost"
gpg: Good signature from "Test Key " [ultimate]
```
### PGP Signature Type Primer Summary
\* Normal/cleartext signatures contain the signature and the original data
\* Detached signatures only contain the signature
\* Verification of a normal/cleartext signature is done using just \*\*one\*\* argument - `gpg --verify `
\* Verification of a detached signature is done using \*\*two\*\* arguments - `gpg --verify  `
## Appendix C - So whose fault was this anyway?
To recap, the `fwupd` signature bypass vulnerability depended on two things:
\* The verification pattern in `fwupd` which assumes that if `gpgme\_op\_verify()` and `gpgme\_op\_verify\_result()` execute successfully, then `gpgme\_op\_verify\_result()` will have returned a non-zero number of signatures that can be examined
\* An edge-case in `libgpgme` where doing `gpgme\_op\_verify()` against a non-detached signature as if it were a detached signature causes a successful verification but with a result of zero signatures
While it can be argued that the verification pattern in `fwupd` is fragile,
what is the root cause? Could the edge-case be handled better in `libgpgme`?
Does it even make sense for a `libgpgme`-based verification to be considered
"successful" if it returns zero signatures?
`libgpgme` essentially wraps the command-line `gnupg` utility. Running `fwupd`
under `strace` and then performing a metadata refresh against the "bypass" POC
endpoint shows some interesting child processes being spawned:
```
$ sudo strace -f -e execve /usr/libexec/fwupd/fwupd

```
We see:
\* Two invocations of `gpg --import` to import the LVFS PGP public keys. They exited with status 0.
\* Two invocations of `gpg --verify`, each one against two file descriptors. They exited with status 2.
The invocations of `gpg --verify` are curious. They specify `--status-fd `
arguments. This is to ask `gpg` to give machine-readable results on a
particular file descriptor, which `libgpgme` would use to get the outcome of
the signature verification.
We can do our own invocations of `gpg --verify` against the real LVFS metadata,
the "invalid key" POC endpoint, the "bad signature" POC endpoint, and the
"bypass" POC endpoint. We can examine the exit code, `--status-fd` and
`--logger-fd` outputs to get an understanding of what `libgpgme` would be seeing.
Test script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
function run\_test {
echo "[+] $1 ($2)"
echo
file\_status=$(mktemp)
file\_logger=$(mktemp)
gpg --enable-special-filenames --batch --no-sk-comments --homedir /var/lib/fwupd/gnupg \

Results:
| | Exit Status | `--status-fd` Output | `--logger-fd` Output |
| ------------------- |:------------:| :--------------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| LVFS | 0 | `PROGRESS`, `GOODSIG`, `VALIDSIG` | Key not trusted |
| POC: Unknown Key | 2 | `PROGRESS`, `ERRSIG`, `NO\_PUBKEY` | No public key |
| POC: Bad Signature | 1 | `PROGRESS`, `BADSIG` | Bad signature |
| POC: Bypass | 2 | Nothing aside from `PROGRESS` | Not a detached signature |
What is curious is that when attempting to `--validate` the "bypass" data,
`gpg` gives a non-zero exit status and complains loudly to `--logger-fd` about
the input data being invalid ("not a detached signature"). However, there is no
corresponding `--status-fd` machine-readable output to indicate the error or
the presence of any signatures, good or bad. This lack of reporting on
`--status-fd` is a possible cause for why `libgpgme` reports seeing zero
signatures in such a case.
\* Should `gpg` complain on `--status-fd` when trying to verify a non-detached signature as if it were detached? Maybe.
\* Should `gpgme\_op\_verify()` notice the non-zero exit status and lack of signatures, and give something \*\*other than\*\* `GPG\_ERR\_NO\_ERROR` to its caller? In my opinion, yes.
And so this could be considered a vulnerability in either `gpg` or `libgpgme`.
During the disclosure process, I contacted . The developers
on duty decided that this would not be handled as a vulnerability.
Developers who use `libgpgme` should take note and ensure that their signature
verification logic defends against a zero-signature result.
Update 10 June 2020: GnuPG have updated their documentation following the
disclosure of this issue. See

# Summary

Exploits CVE-2020-10759 - `fwupd` PGP signature verification bypass. See
<https://github.com/justinsteven/advisories/blob/master/2020_fwupd_dangling_s3_bucket_and_CVE-2020-10759_signature_verification_bypass.md>
for more details.

# Requirements

Note: You need to install `python3-gpg` from your OS vendor. This module
doesn't like being installed via `pip` because it needs to match your system's
installation of `libgpgme`.

```
apt install python3-flask python3-gpg python3-lxml

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1844316#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2020-06-05 04:15:35 UTC  ``` A PGP signature bypass was found in fwupd, which could lead to possible installation of unsigned firmware.  As per upstream:  * For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7: LVFS (LVFS (Linux Vendor Firmware Service) is: a secure portal which allows hardware vendors to upload firmware updates. The site is used by all major Linux distributions to provide metadata for clients such as fwupdmgr and GNOME Software.) was never enabled there although the PGP bypass is possible but not implementable.  * For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8: The LVFS is disabled and never used the Amazon CDN. PGP bypass possible, but not implementable.

# CVE-2020-10759

| **Name** | CVE-2020-10759 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | A PGP signature bypass flaw was found in fwupd (all versions), which could lead to the installation of unsigned firmware. As per upstream, a signature bypass is theoretically possible, but not practical because the Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS) is either not implemented or enabled in versions of fwupd shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity. |

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Validate that gpgme\_op\_verify\_result() returned at least one signature

```
If a detached signature is actually a PGP message, gpgme_op_verify() returns
the rather perplexing GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR, and then gpgme_op_verify_result()
builds an empty list.

Explicitly check for no signatures present to avoid returning a FuKeyringResult
with no timestamp and an empty authority.

Many thanks to Justin Steven <justin@justinsteven.com> for the discovery and
coordinated disclosure of this issue. Fixes [CVE-2020-10759](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-phhj-vpf5-5666 "CVE-2020-10759")
