  "cveId": "CVE-2020-10759",
  "description": "A PGP signature bypass flaw was found in fwupd (all versions), which could lead to the installation of unsigned firmware. As per upstream, a signature bypass is theoretically possible, but not practical because the Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS) is either not implemented or enabled in versions of fwupd shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The vulnerability is caused by an edge-case in GPGme (GnuPG Made Easy) when it tries to verify a normal signature as if it were a detached signature. When a non-detached signature is provided to the `gpgme_op_verify` function as if it were a detached signature, the function returns success and an empty list of signatures. This behavior is exploited in `fwupd` because the code assumes that the `gpgme_op_verify_result()` will return at least one signature if the verification is successful.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper verification of PGP signatures",
        "Reliance on a potentially empty signature list",
        "Use of GPGme library without proper handling of edge cases."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could provide malicious firmware update information to fwupd clients by bypassing the signature verification. This could allow an attacker to compromise the user's hardware.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Compromise of HTTPS connections to a `fwupd` metadata repository",
        "Privileged position within a public `fwupd` metadata repository (such as LVFS)",
        "Privileged position within a local metadata mirror (such as one belonging to an enterprise)",
        "Takeover of a dangling S3 bucket previously used to host metadata.",
         "Man-in-the-middle attacks"
      ],
      "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control or intercept the metadata provided to `fwupd` clients and provide a non-detached PGP signature.",
      "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability exists in `fwupd` versions prior to 1.4.0 and in the `libjcat` library used by `fwupd` from 1.4.0 onwards. The code implementing rollback protection was also bypassed because of a carve-out for cases where the signature verification returns a timestamp of 0 which occurs in the bypass case."
    },
        {
      "rootCause": "A dangling S3 bucket that belonged to LVFS (Linux Vendor Firmware Service) was vulnerable to takeover. This bucket was referenced by the default configuration in `fwupd` version <1.0.6.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Dangling S3 bucket",
        "Legacy `fwupd` configurations pointing to the deleted S3 bucket"
      ],
        "impact": "An attacker who claimed the S3 bucket could offer malicious firmware updates to Linux desktops and servers running legacy versions of `fwupd`.",
       "attackVectors": [
        "S3 bucket takeover"
       ],
       "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to register the dangling S3 bucket.",
        "additionalDetails": "The dangling bucket received more than 2.5 million update requests from over 500,000 unique IP addresses over 26 days."
