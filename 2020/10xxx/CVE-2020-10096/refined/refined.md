Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The Zammad application does not prevent the browser from caching sensitive information.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The application fails to implement proper caching controls for sensitive data. This results in the browser storing confidential information in its cache.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information by examining the browser cache. This access does not require authentication with the Zammad application itself.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack can be carried out in two ways:
    *   **Remote compromise:** An attacker gains remote access to a user's machine.
    *   **Physical access:** An attacker gains physical access to a user's machine.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs either remote or physical access to an affected user's workstation. The attacker does not require valid credentials for the Zammad application to view the cached data.

The vulnerability is present in Zammad versions 1.0.x up to 3.2.0, and is fixed in versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.0.
