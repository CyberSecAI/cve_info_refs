  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2020-10262",
    "summary": "A vulnerability in the XIAOMI XIAOAI speaker Pro (LX06) allows attackers to activate failsafe mode during boot, obtain root shell password, and perform various malicious actions such as reading Wi-Fi credentials, user dialogues, impersonating the speaker's voice, eavesdropping, modifying system files, sending IR codes, stopping voice assistance, and tampering with local network router configurations.",
    "details": {
      "rootCause": "The root cause is the ability to activate failsafe mode during the boot process and subsequently use a mi_console command with the device's SN to obtain the root shell password.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure boot process allowing access to failsafe mode.",
         "The usage of  mi_console command and SN code to derive root shell password",
        "Lack of proper access controls and authentication."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain root access, compromising the device and user data. This can lead to unauthorized access to Wi-Fi credentials, user dialogues, the ability to conduct social engineering attacks, eavesdropping capabilities, modification of system files, controlling IR devices, and manipulating local router configurations. This could result in severe privacy and security breaches.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Physical access is required to activate the failsafe mode during boot process.",
        "Use of mi_console command with SN of device in failsafe mode"
      ],
       "requiredCapabilities": "Attacker needs physical access to the device and ability to interrupt the boot process, coupled with basic understanding of Linux command line tools to utilize the mi_console interface with the device's SN code."
