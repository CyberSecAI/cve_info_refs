Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10573:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a double mutex unlock in the `janus_audiobridge.c` file of the Janus media server. This occurred when listing private rooms within the AudioBridge plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Mutex Unlock:** The code was unlocking a mutex protecting a room instance more than once when listing private rooms in the AudioBridge, which leads to undefined behavior. This is because the mutex is released and some other thread may claim the mutex and then the current thread tries to release an already released mutex.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The double unlock could lead to a crash or undefined behavior and potentially cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is sending a "list" request to an AudioBridge instance hosting private rooms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send requests to a Janus server with the AudioBridge plugin enabled, specifically a "list" request to the AudioBridge instance hosting private rooms.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was a leftover from a previous refactoring, where mutexes were used to ensure room instance validity. This locking mechanism was not needed anymore.
- The fix was to remove the redundant mutex unlock within the loop that iterates through rooms, when it encounters a private room.
- The vulnerability is present in Janus versions up to and including 0.9.1.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit 33430bf in the `meetecho/janus-gateway` repository.
