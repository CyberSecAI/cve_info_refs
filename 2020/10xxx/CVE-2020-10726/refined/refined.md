Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10726:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper handling of `VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD` messages in the DPDK's `librte_vhost` library. A malicious entity can repeatedly send this message, leading to a resource leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Resource exhaustion:** The primary vulnerability is the potential to cause a resource leak (file descriptors and virtual memory) due to the repetitive sending of  `VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD` messages.
- **Lack of rate limiting/validation**: The vulnerability exists because there is no mechanism in place to limit the rate or validate the incoming `VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD` messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By continuously sending the vulnerable message, an attacker can cause a resource leak, ultimately resulting in a denial of service for the vhost-user backend application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access to vhost-user socket:** The attack requires the attacker to have direct access to the vhost-user socket. This is often the case when the attacker controls a container or a guest VM that is connected to the vhost-user socket.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Guest/Container:** The attacker needs to have control of a guest VM or container that is connected to the vulnerable vhost-user socket.
- **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system hosting the vulnerable vhost-user backend application.
- **Ability to Send Messages:** The attacker must be able to send `VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD` messages through the vhost-user socket.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects DPDK versions 19.11 and above.
- The specific mechanism causing the vulnerability was introduced in upstream version 19.11 with a commit related to inflight messages.
- The issue has been addressed in DPDK versions 20.02.1 and 19.11.2, as well as through various Linux distribution updates.
- The CVSS v3 score is rated as 6.0/4.4 (Medium), varying slightly across sources.
