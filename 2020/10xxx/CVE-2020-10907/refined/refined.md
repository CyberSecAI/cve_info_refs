    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2020-10907",
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of widgets in XFA forms. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation of an object's existence before operations are performed on it within XFA forms.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
    "Attack vector": "Remote attackers can exploit this by enticing a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing an XFA form with a specially crafted widget.",
     "Required capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to create or modify a malicious PDF or web page, and the target user must interact with this malicious content."
