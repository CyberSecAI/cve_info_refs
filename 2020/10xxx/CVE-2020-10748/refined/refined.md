**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, which occurs because of the insufficient filtering of data URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can conduct XSS attacks or other further attacks. This potentially allows them to execute malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the insufficient filtering of the `Client baseUrl` when processing data URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate or supply a malicious data URL that will be processed by the vulnerable Keycloak instance.

**Additional details:**
- The bug report indicates that the vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.4.1 via RHSA-2020:2813.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Lauritz Holtmann.

In summary, CVE-2020-10748 is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in Keycloak due to inadequate filtering of data URLs in the `Client baseUrl`. This can be exploited by attackers to perform XSS or related attacks.
