Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10628:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the cleartext transmission of sensitive information. Specifically, the affected Honeywell ControlEdge PLC and RTU devices expose unencrypted passwords and session tokens on the network.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information:** The devices transmit sensitive data (passwords and session tokens) without encryption, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to:
- **Obtain passwords:** By intercepting the unencrypted password transmission, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the device or associated systems.
- **Obtain session tokens:** By intercepting session tokens, an attacker could potentially impersonate a legitimate user and gain access to device or perform malicious actions within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Eavesdropping:** An attacker on the same network as the vulnerable device can capture the unencrypted traffic containing passwords and session tokens using network sniffing tools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be positioned on the same network as the vulnerable devices to intercept network traffic. This does not require any specific level of access or initial compromise.
- **Low Skill Level:** The advisory explicitly states that the vulnerability is "low skill level to exploit". This indicates that the attack is relatively simple to carry out and doesn't require significant expertise.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected devices include various versions of Honeywell ControlEdge PLC and RTU (R130.2, R140, R150, R151, R101, R110).
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- The advisory provides a link to a Honeywell support document for mitigation (login required).
- Mitigation recommendations include minimizing network exposure, isolating control system networks behind firewalls, and using secure remote access methods like VPNs (with awareness of VPN vulnerabilities).
- No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
