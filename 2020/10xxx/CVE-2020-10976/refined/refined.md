The provided content includes information about multiple vulnerabilities patched in GitLab versions 12.9.1, 12.8.8, and 12.7.8, and mentions CVE-2020-10976.

**Vulnerability Details for CVE-2020-10976:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how GitLab handles pipeline status information within merge requests. Specifically, the last status of a restricted pipeline was being returned through a query in the merge request widget.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Information disclosure due to insufficient access control. The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to the last status of a restricted pipeline.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers could potentially gain information about the success or failure status of restricted CI pipelines. This information could be used to infer information about the state or code of the project that the attacker was not supposed to know.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the merge request widget via a query.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to access merge requests of a project where a restricted pipeline has run. No specific user privileges are mentioned besides having access to merge requests.

**Versions Affected:**

*   GitLab EE/CE versions 8.17 and later are affected.
