The provided content is related to CVE-2020-10269.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the presence of hardcoded credentials for the WiFi Access Point functionality on MiR robots.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded credentials: The WiFi access point in certain MiR robots comes pre-configured with well-known SSID (MiR_RXXXX) and default passwords.
- Exposure of credentials: These default credentials have been distributed in past user guides and manuals.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized network access: Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to the robots' network via the WiFi Access Point.
- Full compromise of the robot: Once connected to the robot's network, an attacker may potentially gain control of the robot, or carry out further malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network proximity: Attackers need to be within the range of the robot's WiFi network to connect to the access point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the robot and have knowledge of the default SSID and password.
- No special privileges are required to connect to the vulnerable WiFi access point.

**Affected products:**
MiR100, MiR200, and potentially other MiR fleet vehicles including MiR250, MiR500, and MiR1000. It also affects ER200, ER-Lite, ER-Flex, ER-One, and UVD robots.
Affected firmware versions for MiR100: v2.8.1.1 and prior.
