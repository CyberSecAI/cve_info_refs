{
  "CVE-2020-10957": {
    "Description": "A client can crash the Dovecot server by sending a NOOP command with an invalid string parameter, specifically one that doesn't start with a double quote. This vulnerability affects all SMTP services, including submission-login, making it possible to crash the submission service without authentication.",
    "Root cause": "The server fails to properly validate the string parameter in the NOOP command leading to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). A remote attacker can crash the submission, submission-login, or lmtp services.",
        "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a malformed NOOP command over the network to submission, submission-login, or lmtp port."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and must be able to send a specifically crafted NOOP command to the mail server."
  },
  "CVE-2020-10958": {
      "Description": "Sending many invalid or unknown commands, followed by a sufficient number of newlines, can cause the Dovecot server to access freed memory, leading to a server crash. This happens when the server closes the connection with a '421 Too many invalid commands' error.",
      "Root cause": "The server incorrectly handles a large number of newlines after an invalid command, which leads to a use-after-free condition when closing the connection.",
      "Weaknesses": [
          "Improper handling of input data",
          "Use-after-free"
      ],
      "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). A remote attacker can cause the submission-login, submission, or lmtp services to crash.",
     "Attack vectors": [
          "Sending a sequence of invalid commands followed by a sufficient number of newlines to the submission, submission-login, or lmtp port."
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and must be able to send a sequence of commands and newlines to the mail server."
  },
    "CVE-2020-10967": {
        "Description": "Issuing the RCPT command with an address that has the empty quoted string as the local-part causes the lmtp service to crash.",
        "Root cause": "The server does not properly validate recipient addresses containing empty quoted strings, which results in a crash when processing the RCPT command.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Improper input validation"
        ],
        "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). A remote attacker can crash the lmtp service by sending email with a malformed recipient address.",
       "Attack vectors": [
            "Sending an email with a malformed recipient address (empty quoted local-part) to the lmtp or submission port."
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and must be able to send emails with the malformed recipient address."
