  "CVE-2020-10125": {
    "description": "NCR SelfServ ATMs running APTRA XFS 04.02.01 and 05.01.00 implement 512-bit RSA certificates to validate BNA software updates. Keys of this strength can be broken by an attacker in a sufficiently short period of time, thereby enabling the attacker to sign arbitrary files and CAB archives used to update BNA software, as well as bypass application whitelisting, resulting in the ability to execute arbitrary code.",
    "root_cause": "Use of weak 512-bit RSA certificates for software update validation.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use of weak cryptography (CWE-326)",
      "Bypassing application whitelisting"
    ],
     "impact": "Arbitrary code execution due to the ability to sign malicious BNA software updates.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Physical access to the ATM's internal components, specifically the communications bus between the host computer and the BNA."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs physical access to the ATM's internal components and the ability to break 512-bit RSA certificates."
