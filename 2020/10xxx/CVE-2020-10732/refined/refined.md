Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10732:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The content from `git.kernel.org` directly addresses the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-10732, detailing a fix for a memory initialization issue in the Linux kernel's ELF handling code.
   - The content from `usn.ubuntu.com` also mentions CVE-2020-10732 as one of the security issues fixed in the Linux kernel.
   - The content from `www.suse.com` also describes CVE-2020-10732 and indicates its fix status.
   - The content from `lists.opensuse.org` mentions CVE-2020-10732 as one of the security issues fixed in the Linux kernel.
   - The content from `security.netapp.com` also lists CVE-2020-10732 as a Linux Kernel Vulnerability in NetApp Products.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

The root cause is a flaw in the `fill_thread_core_info()` function within `fs/binfmt_elf.c` of the Linux kernel. This function, responsible for filling core dump information, used uninitialized memory allocated via `kmalloc`. When dumping core, this uninitialized memory could be written to disk.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Uninitialized Memory:** The core issue is the allocation of memory using `kmalloc`, which does not initialize the allocated memory region, leading to potentially sensitive kernel data being left uninitialized.
*   **Information Leak:** The uninitialized data, being part of core dump, can be potentially read by a non-privileged user.
*   **Incorrect usage:** The code incorrectly assumes that skb would only contain a single netlink message

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the potential exposure of sensitive kernel memory to non-privileged users through core dumps. This can aid an attacker in future exploits by revealing details about kernel memory layout and internal states.

**5. Attack Vectors**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local attacker who can trigger a core dump (e.g., by causing a crash in a program).
*   **Core Dump Analysis:** The attacker requires access to the generated core dump file to read the uninitialized memory.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the vulnerable system.
*   **Ability to trigger a core dump:** The attacker needs a method to cause the system to generate a core dump, such as by executing a crashing program.
*   **File Access:** The attacker requires the ability to access the core dump file, which is typically written to disk.

**Additional Details:**
*  The vulnerability is fixed by changing `kmalloc` to `kzalloc`. `kzalloc` allocates memory and initializes it with zeros which prevents the sensitive kernel data leak.
* The SUSE advisory notes that SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the kernel, and that this issue affects the kernel side of SELinux, not the userland libselinux.
* The Ubuntu advisory mentions a broader set of vulnerabilities fixed in their kernel update and notes the ABI change that requires a recompile and reinstallation of third party kernel modules.
* The openSUSE advisory includes an extensive list of bug fixes along with CVE fixes that were included in the update.
* The NetApp advisory confirms that the affected NetApp products incorporate Linux Kernel and mentions that successful exploitation can lead to disclosure of sensitive information.
