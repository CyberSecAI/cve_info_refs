Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `cluster-image-registry-operator` in OpenShift Container Platform was logging sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information (likely secrets/credentials) were being written to the logs of the image registry operator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Read/Write Access to Image Registry Storage:** An attacker who gains access to the logs containing the sensitive information could use this information to obtain read and write access to the storage backing the internal image registry.
- **Data Integrity Compromise:** The attacker could potentially modify container image content within the registry storage if they gained access, leading to a breach of data integrity. While internal references use digests, an attacker could modify image content referenced by tags.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Log Access:** An attacker needs to gain access to the logs produced by the `cluster-image-registry-operator` where the sensitive information is being written.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Log Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the logs generated by the affected operator. This could be via compromised infrastructure or other means to reach the log files.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** OpenShift Container Platform versions 4.1 to 4.4 inclusive were affected.
- **Mitigation:** Ensuring the image registry operator logs remain private helps to prevent the exploitation.
- **Upstream Patch:** A patch was made available in the upstream project repository: `<https://github.com/openshift/cluster-image-registry-operator/pull/527>`
- **Fixes:** The issue was addressed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 through the errata RHSA-2020:2026, RHSA-2020:2009 and RHSA-2020:2136, respectively.
