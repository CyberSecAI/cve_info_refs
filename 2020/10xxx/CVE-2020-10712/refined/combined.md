| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1825161#c0)  Jason Shepherd    2020-04-17 09:16:26 UTC  ``` The image registry operator in OpenShift Container Platform version 4.4 and later logs sensitive information. An attacker able to obtain the log could gain read and write access to the storage backing the OpenShift Container Platform internal image registry.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1825161#c1)  Jason Shepherd    2020-04-17 09:16:29 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Adam Kaplan (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1825161#c11)  Jason Shepherd    2020-04-21 23:24:51 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Ensure that the image registry operator logs remain private.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1825161#c12)  Jason Shepherd    2020-05-05 00:15:04 UTC  ``` Upstream Patch:  <https://github.com/openshift/cluster-image-registry-operator/pull/527>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1825161#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-05-12 05:11:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.3  Via RHSA-2020:2009 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2009](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A2009)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1825161#c14)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-05-12 10:33:28 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-10712>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1825161#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-05-13 11:27:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.2  Via RHSA-2020:2026 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2026](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A2026)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1825161#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-05-18 15:44:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.4  Via RHSA-2020:2136 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2136](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A2136)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1825161#c19)  Jason Shepherd    2020-11-08 22:54:38 UTC  ``` Statement:  References to internal container components making up OpenShift Container Platform 4.x itself all use digests to refer to container images [1]. Therefore any changes to the images in the registry storage will invalidate those references. This issue could allow an attacker to modify other container image content that is referred to by tag however.
