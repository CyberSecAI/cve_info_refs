Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10780:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a CSV Injection vulnerability in the Orchestration Template feature of Red Hat CloudForms.  The application doesn't properly sanitize user-provided input, which allows a low privilege user to inject malicious CSV formulas into the orchestration templates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSV Injection: The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization when creating Orchestration Templates in Red Hat CloudForms.  Specifically, user supplied input in orchestration templates is not escaped when output as a CSV file. This allows an attacker to inject spreadsheet formulas.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution:  When a victim exports the crafted orchestration template as a CSV file and opens it in a spreadsheet application (like Microsoft Excel), the injected malicious formulas execute. This could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the user opening the file.
- System Compromise:  The execution of arbitrary code could lead to serious damage to the victim's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted CSV Formula: The attacker crafts a malicious CSV formula (e.g., starting with `=`) and injects it into an Orchestration Template within Red Hat CloudForms.
- Export and Open CSV: The victim exports the template as a CSV file and opens it using a spreadsheet application. This triggers the execution of the injected formula.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low-Privilege User Access:  The attacker needs to be a low-privilege user on the Red Hat CloudForms system, with the ability to create or modify Orchestration Templates.
- No Direct Server Compromise: This vulnerability does not allow attackers to directly compromise the CloudForms server, however, successful exploitation would allow for code execution on a users machine who opens the exported CSV.

**Additional Details:**
- Red Hat has rated this vulnerability as having a medium severity and medium priority.
- The vulnerability is only exploitable against a windows environment because the malicious formulas are executed through software such as Microsoft Excel.
- The vulnerability has been addressed in CloudForms Management Engine 5.11.7.0.
- The vulnerability is not intended to directly affect the CloudForms server.
