{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free in the `napi_gro_frags()` function within the Linux kernel's networking subsystem. This occurs when a network driver provides an skb (socket buffer) with a page fragment of exactly 14 bytes to `napi_gro_frags()`. The subsequent call to `gro_pull_from_frag0()` consumes this fragment, potentially freeing the underlying memory. A later read in `napi_frags_skb()` accesses the freed memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability",
      "Improper memory management"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who can trigger this condition can cause a system crash (denial-of-service). The vulnerability can lead to reading mangled data or a system crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local attacker with the ability to influence the network traffic and manipulate the size of the packet fragments passed to the `napi_gro_frags()` function can trigger the vulnerability. Specifically, the attacker needs to craft or manipulate network packets so a page fragment of exactly 14 bytes is passed to `napi_gro_frags()`.",
    "required_capabilities": "Local access to the system and the ability to control network traffic and manipulate packet fragments."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_function": "`napi_gro_frags()` and `napi_frags_skb()` in `net/core/dev.c`",
      "mitigation": "Disabling GSO (Generic Segmentation Offload) on the network interface using ethtool can prevent the vulnerable code path from being taken.",
     "fix_commit": "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=a4270d6795b0580287453ea55974d948393e66ef",
    "fix_versions": "Fixed in Linux kernel version 5.2 and backported to various stable series such as 3.16.75, 4.4.181, 4.9.181, 4.14.124, 4.19.48, 5.0.21, and 5.1.7."
