Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-10933:

**1.  Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** A heap exposure vulnerability exists in the Ruby socket library. Specifically, the `BasicSocket#recv_nonblock` and `BasicSocket#read_nonblock` methods, when used with a size and buffer argument, resize the buffer to the specified size. If the operation blocks, these methods return without copying data, leaving the buffer with arbitrary data from the heap. This can lead to the exposure of potentially sensitive information from the Ruby interpreter's heap memory.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability is related to improper handling of buffer resizing and data copying in non-blocking socket operations within the Ruby socket library. It arises from the allocation of a new buffer using the specified size without proper sanitization when a non-blocking operation would otherwise block, leading to the copy of arbitrary heap data into it.
*  **Impact:** Successful exploitation can result in the disclosure of sensitive information contained in the Ruby interpreter's heap memory.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by calling `BasicSocket#recv_nonblock` or `BasicSocket#read_nonblock` with specific size and buffer arguments.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to invoke the vulnerable methods within a Ruby application. Network access is implied by the vulnerable methods, but it is not explicitly specified in the provided text.

**2. Affected Components and Versions:**

*   The vulnerability affects Ruby versions 2.5.x through 2.5.7, 2.6.x through 2.6.5 and 2.7.0.
*   It is present in Ruby since version 2.5.0 and does not affect versions prior to this.
*   The issue is exploitable only on Linux.

**3. Remediation:**

*   NetApp states that "None" are the affected products and advises to obtain software fixes through the NetApp Support website in the Software Download section.
*   NetApp is aware of public discussion of this vulnerability.
*  The Ruby project recommends upgrading Ruby to versions after the listed vulnerable versions.
*   Debian has provided a security update for ruby2.5 (version 2.5.5-3+deb10u2) that resolves the vulnerability.
*   Red Hat has released fixes for the vulnerability in  `ruby-2.7.1-128.fc33`, `ruby-2.7.1-127.fc32`, and `ruby-2.6.6-125.fc31`.

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.3 (MEDIUM) with vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N. This indicates a remotely exploitable issue with low attack complexity and no required privileges or user interaction, but with a low impact on confidentiality.

**5. NetApp Specific Information:**

*   NetApp advisory NTAP-20200625-0001 states that "Multiple NetApp products incorporate Ruby," however, it later clarifies "None" as affected products.
*   The advisory provides a comprehensive list of "Products Not Affected", indicating that NetApp has investigated the vulnerability across its product range.
*   The advisory also states that NetApp is aware of public discussion of this vulnerability and provided a link to the Ruby advisory.

**In Summary:**

CVE-2020-10933 is a heap exposure vulnerability in the Ruby socket library, specifically impacting `BasicSocket#recv_nonblock` and `BasicSocket#read_nonblock` methods. It can lead to the exposure of sensitive data if exploited. Although multiple NetApp products incorporate Ruby, no NetApp products are listed as affected by this CVE, however, NetApp is aware of the public discussion of this vulnerability. Fixes are available through Ruby updates, and some Linux distributions have provided their own patches.
