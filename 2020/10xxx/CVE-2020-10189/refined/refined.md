{
  "CVE-2020-10189": {
    "Description": "An unauthenticated attacker can reach a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability that can allow them to execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM/root.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `FileStorage` class of the `CewolfServlet`. It arises from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data (the 'img' parameter), which leads to deserialization of untrusted data. The `getChartImage` method in `FileStorage` creates a new `ObjectInputStream` from a filepath built using attacker-controlled input and then deserializes an object from the stream without validation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-502",
      "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on affected installations of ManageEngine Desktop Central with SYSTEM privileges without authentication.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Unauthenticated network access to the vulnerable `CewolfServlet`.",
       "Abuse of the `MDMLogUploaderServlet` to upload a malicious serialized payload."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker must be able to send crafted POST requests to the  `MDMLogUploaderServlet` and GET request to `CewolfServlet`",
    "More detail": "The `MDMLogUploaderServlet` allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload files to arbitrary paths, using directory traversal in the 'udid' parameter. This is combined with the deserialization vulnerability in `CewolfServlet` to achieve remote code execution."
