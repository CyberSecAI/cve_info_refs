# Zoho zero-day published on Twitter

Security experts fear the bug may be soon exploited by ransomware gangs.

* [10 dangerous app vulnerabilities to watch out for (free PDF)](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/10-dangerous-app-vulnerabilities-to-watch-out-for-free-pdf/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b)

A security researcher published yesterday details on Twitter about a zero-day vulnerability in a Zoho enterprise product.

Cyber-security experts who have reviewed the vulnerability have told *ZDNet* that the zero-day could spell trouble for companies around the world, as it could be an entry point for ransomware gangs to infect corporate networks and ransom their data.

The vulnerability impacts the [Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central](https://www.manageengine.com/products/desktop-central/). According to the Zoho website, this is an endpoint management solution. Companies use the product to control their fleets of devices -- such as Android smartphones, Linux servers, or Mac and Windows workstations.

The product works as a central server inside a company, allowing system administrators to push updates, take control over systems remotely, lock devices, apply access restrictions, and more.

Yesterday, a security researcher named Steven Seeley, [published details](https://srcincite.io/advisories/src-2020-0011/), along with [proof-of-concept demo code](https://srcincite.io/pocs/src-2020-0011.py.txt), about an unpatched bug in this product.

"This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of ManageEngine Desktop Central," Seeley said.

The (attacker's) code is executed without the need for authentication, and the code runs with root privileges on the machine, Seeley added.

This effectively means that hackers can take full control over ManageEngine systems, and a company's fleet of devices.

### Ideal for ransomware attacks

Products like Zoho's ManageEngine are often employed by companies that provide remote IT support -- called managed service providers (MSPs).

Over the past year, multiple ransomware gangs have figured out that they could target MSPs and the software they use to plant ransomware on the networks of their clients.

The bug disclosed today on Twitter puts all the companies that rely on Zoho ManageEngine, along with all the MSPs that rely on it and their clients, at risk.

"This sounds like the worst-case scenario for MSPs using this product," [Daniel Goldberg](https://twitter.com/ace__pace), a malware analyst at Guardicore told *ZDNet*. "They get breached, all their customers get breached and it's a race who will attack first."

"Ransomware groups at this point have it down to a science," Goldberg added. "Find a simple reliable exploit like this, attack opportunistic victims, find those with money to pay, and profit."

### More than 2,300 exposed servers

Currently, there are [more than 2,300 installations](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=http.title%3A%22ManageEngine+Desktop%22) of Zoho ManageEngine systems exposed on the internet, according to Nate Warfield, an analyst for the Microsoft Security Response Center.

> <https://t.co/cCOrj1t6bo> - "only" 2300+ of these online.....
>
> — Nate Warfield (@n0x08) [March 5, 2020](https://twitter.com/n0x08/status/1235637306838532096?ref_src=twsrc^tfw)

All of these 2,300 exposed instances are akin to gateways into those companies, due to the recently-shared zero-day.

In an interview with *ZDNet*, [Leandro Velasco](https://twitter.com/LeandroNVelasco), a threat intel analyst for KPN Security, also pointed out that this vulnerability is also ideal for lateral movement.

Even if a company does not expose the Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central over the internet, it can be used inside their networks.

An attacker gaining access to one computer inside a company's network can use the Zoho zero-day to gain access over the ManageEngine server and then push malware to all the other computers on the company's network.

Velasco has seen these types of attacks before while monitoring REvil (Sodinokibi) ransomware infections -- [one of the first ransomware strains to target MSPs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-gang-hacks-msps-to-deploy-ransomware-on-customer-systems/) and their software in so-called "supply chain attacks" on bigger targets.

This tactic -- of attacking MSPs and their software -- has now become mainstream among other ransomware gangs.

"In the last few months, we saw campaigns focusing on specialized software used by MSPs, like remote access management tooling," said Sander Peters, head of KPN Security, [in a report](https://overons.kpn/content/downloads/news/European-Cyber-Security-Perspectives-KPN-2020.pdf#page=17) about the software supply chain risks in Europe.

In a similar report, US cyber-security firm Armor claims it tracked [13 MSPs in 2019 that have been hacked](https://www.zdnet.com/article/at-least-13-managed-service-providers-were-used-to-push-ransomware-this-year/) or had their software abused to install ransomware on the networks of their clients.

### No disclosure

The Zoho zero-day will, without a doubt, trigger a wave of hacks. The Shodan search listed above unearths some "juicy" targets for hackers.

Currently, a patch is not available because Seeley never notified Zoho. On Twitter, the researcher claimed that "Zoho typically ignores researchers," and shared the code online.

Some security researchers have criticized Seeley's move to disclose the zero-day without notifying Zoho, calling it unprofessional. However, other security researchers said they've also been ignored when reporting issues to Zoho.

A Zoho spokesperson told *ZDNet* that Seeley never contacted its security team, and that they learned of the issue from a customer. A patch is expected for later today, at 10:30am PT.

Patch ..: https://www.manageengine.com/products/desktop-central/remote-code-execution-vulnerability.html
## Summary:
An unauthenticated attacker can reach a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability that can allow them to execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM/root.
## Vulnerability Analysis:
In the web.xml file, we can see one of the default available servlets is the `CewolfServlet` servlet.
```
CewolfServlet
de.laures.cewolf.CewolfRenderer
debug
false

overliburl
/js/overlib.js

storage
de.laures.cewolf.storage.FileStorage

1

...
CewolfServlet
/cewolf/\*

```
This servlet, contains the following code:
```
protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
throws ServletException, IOException {
if (debugged) {
logRequest(request);
}
addHeaders(response);
if ((request.getParameter("state") != null) || (!request.getParameterNames().hasMoreElements())) {
requestState(response);
return;
}
int width = 400;
int height = 400;
boolean removeAfterRendering = false;
if (request.getParameter("removeAfterRendering") != null) {
removeAfterRendering = true;
}
if (request.getParameter("width") != null) {
width = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("width"));
}
if (request.getParameter("height") != null) {
height = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("height"));
}
if (!renderingEnabled) {
renderNotEnabled(response, 400, 50);
return;
}
if ((width > config.getMaxImageWidth()) || (height > config.getMaxImageHeight())) {
renderImageTooLarge(response, 400, 50);
return;
}
String imgKey = request.getParameter("img"); // 1
if (imgKey == null) {
logAndRenderException(new ServletException("no 'img' parameter provided for Cewolf servlet."), response,
width, height);
return;
}
Storage storage = config.getStorage();
ChartImage chartImage = storage.getChartImage(imgKey, request); // 2
```
At [1] the code sets the `imgKey` variable using the GET parameter `img`. Later at [2], the code then calls the `storage.getChartImage` method with the attacker supplied `img`. You maybe wondering what class the `storage` instance is. This was mapped as an initializing parameter to the servlet code in the web.xml file:
```
storage
de.laures.cewolf.storage.FileStorage

```
```
public class FileStorage implements Storage {
static final long serialVersionUID = -6342203760851077577L;
String basePath = null;
List stored = new ArrayList();
private boolean deleteOnExit = false;
//...
public void init(ServletContext servletContext) throws CewolfException {
basePath = servletContext.getRealPath("/");
Configuration config = Configuration.getInstance(servletContext);
deleteOnExit = "true".equalsIgnoreCase("" + (String) config.getParameters().get("FileStorage.deleteOnExit"));
servletContext.log("FileStorage initialized, deleteOnExit=" + deleteOnExit);
}
//...
private String getFileName(String id) {
return basePath + "\_chart" + id; // 4
}
//...
public ChartImage getChartImage(String id, HttpServletRequest request) {
ChartImage res = null;
ObjectInputStream ois = null;
try {
ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(getFileName(id))); // 3
res = (ChartImage) ois.readObject(); // 5
ois.close();
} catch (Exception ex) {
ex.printStackTrace();
} finally {
if (ois != null) {
try {
ois.close();
} catch (IOException ioex) {
ioex.printStackTrace();
}
}
}
return res;
}
```
At [3] the code calls `getFileName` using the attacker controlled `id` GET parameter which returns a path to a file on the filesystem using `basePath`. This field is set in the `init` method of the servlet. On the same line, the code creates a new `ObjectInputStream` instance from the supplied filepath via `FileInputStream`. This path is attacker controlled at [4], however, there is no need to (ab)use traversals here for exploitation.
The most important point is that at [5] the code calls `readObject` using the contents of the file without any further lookahead validation.
## Exploitation:
For exploitation, an attacker can (ab)use the `MDMLogUploaderServlet` servlet to plant a file on the filesystem with controlled content inside. Here is the corresponding web.xml entry:
```
MDMLogUploaderServlet
com.me.mdm.onpremise.webclient.log.MDMLogUploaderServlet

...
MDMLogUploaderServlet
/mdm/mdmLogUploader
/mdm/client/v1/mdmLogUploader

```
```
public class MDMLogUploaderServlet extends DeviceAuthenticatedRequestServlet {
private Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("MDMLogger");
private Long customerID;
private String deviceName;
private String domainName;
private Long resourceID;
private Integer platformType;
private Long acceptedLogSize = Long.valueOf(314572800L);
public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, DeviceRequest deviceRequest)
throws ServletException, IOException {
Reader reader = null;
PrintWriter printWriter = null;
logger.log(Level.WARNING, "Received Log from agent");
Long nDataLength = Long.valueOf(request.getContentLength());
logger.log(Level.WARNING, "MDMLogUploaderServlet : file conentent lenght is {0}", nDataLength);
logger.log(Level.WARNING, "MDMLogUploaderServlet :Acceptable file conentent lenght is {0}", acceptedLogSize);
try {
if (nDataLength.longValue() <= acceptedLogSize.longValue()) {
String udid = request.getParameter("udid"); // 1
String platform = request.getParameter("platform");
String fileName = request.getParameter("filename"); // 2
HashMap deviceMap = MDMUtil.getInstance().getDeviceDetailsFromUDID(udid);
if (deviceMap != null) {
customerID = ((Long) deviceMap.get("CUSTOMER\_ID"));
deviceName = ((String) deviceMap.get("MANAGEDDEVICEEXTN.NAME"));
domainName = ((String) deviceMap.get("DOMAIN\_NETBIOS\_NAME"));
resourceID = ((Long) deviceMap.get("RESOURCE\_ID"));
platformType = ((Integer) deviceMap.get("PLATFORM\_TYPE"));
} else {
customerID = Long.valueOf(0L);
deviceName = "default";
domainName = "default";
}
String baseDir = System.getProperty("server.home");
deviceName = removeInvalidCharactersInFileName(deviceName);
String localDirToStore = baseDir + File.separator + "mdm-logs" + File.separator + customerID
+ File.separator + deviceName + "\_" + udid; // 3
File file = new File(localDirToStore);
if (!file.exists()) {
file.mkdirs(); // 4
}
logger.log(Level.WARNING, "absolute Dir {0} ", new Object[]{localDirToStore});
fileName = fileName.toLowerCase();
if ((fileName != null) && (FileUploadUtil.hasVulnerabilityInFileName(fileName, "log|txt|zip|7z"))) { // 5
logger.log(Level.WARNING, "MDMLogUploaderServlet : Going to reject the file upload {0}", fileName);
response.sendError(403, "Request Refused");
return;
}
String absoluteFileName = localDirToStore + File.separator + fileName; // 6
logger.log(Level.WARNING, "absolute File Name {0} ", new Object[]{fileName});
InputStream in = null;
FileOutputStream fout = null;
try {
in = request.getInputStream(); // 7
fout = new FileOutputStream(absoluteFileName); // 8
byte[] bytes = new byte['✐'];
int i;
while ((i = in.read(bytes)) != -1) {
fout.write(bytes, 0, i); // 9
}
fout.flush();
} catch (Exception e1) {
e1.printStackTrace();
} finally {
if (fout != null) {
fout.close();
}
if (in != null) {
in.close();
}
}
SupportFileCreation supportFileCreation = SupportFileCreation.getInstance();
supportFileCreation.incrementMDMLogUploadCount();
JSONObject deviceDetails = new JSONObject();
deviceDetails.put("platformType", platformType);
deviceDetails.put("dataId", resourceID);
deviceDetails.put("dataValue", deviceName);
supportFileCreation.removeDeviceFromList(deviceDetails);
} else {
logger.log(Level.WARNING,
"MDMLogUploaderServlet : Going to reject the file upload as the file conentent lenght is {0}",
nDataLength);
response.sendError(403, "Request Refused");
return;
}
return;
} catch (Exception e) {
logger.log(Level.WARNING, "Exception ", e);
} finally {
if (reader != null) {
try {
reader.close();
} catch (Exception ex) {
ex.fillInStackTrace();
}
}
}
}
```
```
private static boolean isContainDirectoryTraversal(String fileName) {
if ((fileName.contains("/")) || (fileName.contains("\\"))) {
return true;
}
return false;
}
//...
public static boolean hasVulnerabilityInFileName(String fileName, String allowedFileExt) {
if ((isContainDirectoryTraversal(fileName)) || (isCompletePath(fileName))
|| (!isValidFileExtension(fileName, allowedFileExt))) {
return true;
}
return false;
}
```
We can see that at [1] the `udid` variable is controlled using the `udid` GET parameter from a POST request. At [2] the `fileName` variable is controlled from the GET parameter `filename`. This `filename` GET parameter is actually filtered in 2 different ways for malicious values. At [3] a path is contructed using the GET parameter from [1] and at [4] a `mkdirs` primitive is hit. This is important because the \_charts directory doesn't exist on the filesystem which is needed in order to exploit the deserialization bug. There is some validation on the `filename` at [5] which calls `FileUploadUtil.hasVulnerabilityInFileName` to check for directory traversals and an allow list of extensions.
Of course, this doesn't stop `udid` from containing directory traversals, but I digress. At [6] the `absoluteFileName` variable is built up from the attacker influenced path at [3] using the filename from [2] and at [7] the binary input stream is read from the attacker controlled POST body. Finally at [8] and [9] the file is opened and the contents of the request is written to disk. What is not apparent however, is that further validation is performed on the `filename` at [2]. Let's take one more look at the web.xml file:
```
config-file
security-regex.xml,security-mdm-regex.xml,security-mdm-api-regex.xml,security-properties.xml,security-common.xml,security-admin-sec-settings.xml,security-fws.xml,security-api.xml,security-patch-restapi.xml,security-mdm-groupdevices.xml,security-mdm-admin.xml,security-mdm-general.xml,security-mdm-agent.xml,security-mdm-reports.xml,security-mdm-inventory.xml,security-mdm-appmgmt.xml,security-mdm-docmgmt.xml,security-mdm-configuration.xml,security-defaultresponseheaders.xml,security-mdm-remote.xml,security-mdm-api-json.xml,security-mdm-api-get.xml,security-mdm-api-post.xml,security-mdm-api-put.xml,security-mdm-api-delete.xml,security-mdm-privacy.xml,security-mdm-osmgmt.xml,security-mdmapi-appmgmt.xml,security-mdmapi-profilejson.xml,security-mdmapi-profilemgmt.xml,security-mdm-compliance.xml,security-mdm-geofence.xml,security-mdmapi-sdp.xml,security-mdmp-CEA.xml,security-mdmapi-supporttab.xml,security-mdmapi-general.xml,security-mdm-roles.xml,security-mdm-technicians.xml,security-mdm-cea.xml,security-mdmapi-content-mgmt.xml,security-config.xml,security-patch.xml,security-patch-apd-scan.xml,security-patch-apd-scan-views.xml,security-patch-deployment.xml,security-patch-views.xml,security-patch-config.xml,security-patch-onpremise.xml,security-patch-server.xml,security-onpremise-common.xml,security-mdm-onpremise-files.xml,security-mdmapi-directory.xml,security-admin.xml,security-onpremise-admin.xml,security-reports.xml,security-inventory.xml,security-custom-fields.xml

```
The file that stands out is the `security-mdm-agent.xml` config file. The corrosponding entry for the `MDMLogUploaderServlet` servlet looks like this:
```

```
Note that the authentication attribute is ignored in this case. The `filename` GET parameter is restricted to the following strings: "logger.txt", "logger.zip", "mdmlogs.zip" and "managedprofile\_mdmlogs.zip" using a regex pattern. For exploitation, this limitation doesn't matter since the deserialization bug permits a completely controlled filename.
