[View exposed systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/vulnerability/cves/CVE-2020-10713)

* Overview

## Executive summary

Red Hat is currently responding to a flaw in the GRUB 2 boot loader that impacts our products, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This flaw allows an attacker, already on the system, to hijack the boot process and execute malicious code during system startup. Systems utilizing UEFI Secure Boot, which protect systems by verifying the software used to boot up a computer, can also be bypassed using this vulnerability. This issue is assigned [CVE-2020-10713](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10713) and rated with a severity impact of [Moderate](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification). Red Hat customers using affected versions are recommended to apply updates. Red Hat also recommends updating to the most recent images and latest version of container host-systems.

The following Red Hat product versions are impacted:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
* Red Hat Atomic Host
* OpenShift Container Platform 4 (RHEL CoreOS)

To determine if your system is currently vulnerable to these flaws, see the Diagnose section below. Additionally, customers can refer to the Ansible playbook for automatic remediation provided below.

## Technical summary

In CVE-2020-10713, an attacker may use the GRUB 2 flaw to hijack and tamper the GRUB  verification process. This flaw also allows the bypass of Secure Boot protections. In order to load an untrusted or modified kernel, an attacker would first need to establish access to the system such as gaining physical access, obtain the ability to alter a pxe-boot network, or have remote access to a  networked system with root access. With this access, an attacker could then craft a string to cause a buffer overflow by injecting a malicious payload that leads to arbitrary code execution within GRUB.

To ensure Secure Boot protections of the loaded kernel and prevent the system load of untrusted code at startup, newly validated keys and certificates are issued for grub2, kernel, fwupdate, fwupd, shim, and dbxtool packages.

### Mitigation

There is no mitigation for the flaw.

### Remediation

Red Hat recommends all customers to update their grub2 packages. Red Hat customers using Secure Boot need to update kernel, fwupdate, fwupd, shim and dbxtool packages containing newly validated keys and certificates.

Users running Secure Boot with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 need to take additional steps to boot into previously released RHEL 8 kernels after applying the grub2 package updates. See the RHEL 8 section below for more details.

## Technical details

The GRUB 2 boot loader is configurable via the grub.cfg file, which is composed of several string tokens. The configuration file is loaded and parsed at GRUB initialization right after the initial boot loader, called shim, has loaded it. During the parser stage, the configuration values are copied to internal buffers stored in memory. Configuration tokens that are longer in length than the internal buffer size end up leading to a buffer overflow issue. An attacker may leverage this flaw to execute arbitrary code, further hijacking the machine’s boot process and bypassing Secure Boot protection. Consequently, it is possible for unsigned binary code to be loaded, further jeopardizing the integrity of the system.

### Background

#### What is UEFI Secure Boot and how it works?

Secure Boot is a UEFI firmware security feature developed by the UEFI Consortium that ensures only immutable and signed software are loaded during the boot time. Secure Boot leverages cryptography and digital signing to validate the authenticity, source, and integrity of the code that is loaded. These validation steps are taken to prevent malicious code from being loaded and to prevent attacks, such as the installation of certain types of rootkits. For more information on UEFI and Secure Boot see [UEFI Secure Boot in Modern Computer Security Solutions](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uefi.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fresources%2FUEFI_Secure_Boot_in_Modern_Computer_Security_Solutions_2013.pdf).

Secure Boot is split into several pieces and stages. The first important concept is the Allow DB (DB) and Disallow DB (DBX) databases. The Allow DB (DB) database stores the hashes and keys for trusted loaders and EFI applications that are allowed to be loaded by the machine’s firmware. The Disallow DB (DBX) database stores revoked, compromised, and non-trusted hashes and keys. Any attempt to load signed code using the Disallow DB keys or in the case where the hash matches a Disallow DB entry will lead to boot failure.

Trusted applications are signed by a central Certificate Authority. The public certificate is stored in the hardware, allowing third-party EFI applications signed by this certificate to load successfully.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/EWWksJQKlwJyur1cBV5lCanfbF5m36DxRDQs8Ax6K9jn0Au5yWdmK5tQAtULQm-qQw9zOafCD1Pvny5vMJWdbhTr4FV9Qlnk_FQpXI6GbeiuKOjJ5uFMy9pnasLRsfR-Ll58p2Gr)

On the Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions which support Secure Boot the signed and trusted application is the shim package which is the first application loaded by the machine’s firmware. The shim package itself holds Red Hat’s certificate and its own databases of trusted keys and code hashes that are allowed to be loaded. This data is used to verify the boot loader signature, which is GRUB 2, making sure it has not been compromised or tampered by a malicious actor. Once the verification succeeds, GRUB is loaded and verifies the kernel signature and confirms that it matches with Red Hat’s certificate or any hash enrolled by the user itself into the Allow DB. If there is a match, GRUB will load the kernel, which finishes the boot load process.

### Product impact

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 and 8, Red Hat Enterprise Atomic Host, and RHEL CoreOS (part of Openshift Container Platform 4) ship the vulnerable GRUB 2 version.

#### Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

Due to hardening within the kernel, which is released as part of these updates, previous Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 kernel versions have not been added to shim’s allow list. If you are running with Secure Boot enabled, and the user needs to boot to an older kernel version, its hash must be manually enrolled into the trust list. This is achieved by executing the following commands:

# pesign -P -h -i /boot/vmlinuz-<version>

# mokutil --import-hash <hash value returned from pesign>

# reboot

#### Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

Red Hat has added previous Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 kernel hashes into the shim’s allow database, allowing Secure Boot users to boot into older versions of the kernel.

#### RHEL Atomic Host

At this time, updating the shim binaries on RHEL Atomic Host is not possible. Customers should assess the issue and decide if provisioning nodes using updated boot media is warranted.

#### OpenShift Container Platform 4 (RHEL CoreOS)

At this time, Red Hat is not shipping updates for the EFI system partition (including shim, grub) for RHEL CoreOS. An accepted best practice is to reprovision nodes periodically; customers can do so using the updated “boot images.” Customers should assess their impact and decide if updating boot images at this time are warranted.

Since the vulnerability primarily affects the integrity of bare-metal systems with Secure Boot enabled, updating and using the new boot images is the only recommended action. The steps for updating boot images vary and are dependent on how customers have provisioned their bare-metal infrastructure. This process could require updating the PXE configuration of your boot infrastructure to provide new boot images, or it may involve reinstalling your bare-metal systems using an updated install ISO and bare-metal disk images. Customers should consider their environment and refer to OpenShift documentation on how to update the boot images correctly. For more information, see: [Installing a cluster on bare metal](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.openshift.com%2Fcontainer-platform%2F4.5%2Finstalling%2Finstalling_bare_metal%2Finstalling-bare-metal.html).

If reprovisioning nodes with updated boot images are required, customers should take the necessary steps to cordon and drain the nodes they wish to reprovision. Customers should reprovision their nodes one at a time to avoid disrupting the overall health of the cluster.

To cordon a node:

$ oc adm cordon <node name>

To drain a node:

$ oc adm drain <node name>

Once a node has been successfully cordoned and drained, customers should initiate a reboot and reinstallation of the node then confirm it was correctly reprovisioned with the updated boot images.

## Updates for affected products

The shim package initially released has been replaced by a new version. Updated shim packages are available and can be used in conjunction with previously released grub2, fwupd, and fwupdate packages. For more information on the initial shim packages see <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5272311>. Red Hat strongly recommends customers running affected versions apply available updates.

## FAQ

Q: How do I check if my system has Secure Boot enabled?

A: It’s possible to check if Secure Boot feature is enable by running the following command:

$ mokutil --sb-state

SecureBoot enabled

NOTE: On systems with Secure Boot disabled, using the mokutil command with any variables will display the following output:

# mokutil -l

EFI variables are not supported on this system

Q: Do I need to reboot or restart after installing updated packages?

A: Yes, a reboot is needed to ensure updated components are being used.

Q: How are containers impacted?

A: While this issue does not directly impact Red Hat Enterprise Linux-based containers, their security relies upon the integrity of the host kernel environment. Red Hat recommends updating to the most recent images and latest version of container host-systems. To protect the privacy of the containers in use, customers will need to apply and deploy the updates to the container host (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Atomic Host).

Q: I’m running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and I’m not able to update my kernel version. Should I enroll the hash value from my kernel version into trusted DB?

A: It’s not needed. Older kernel versions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 will be added automatically on the shim’s allow list.

Q: I’m running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, should I enroll the hash value from my kernel version into trusted DB?

A: Yes, older Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 kernel versions won’t be trusted by default. To be able to boot any previous kernel version you can execute the following commands as root user:

# pesign -P -h -i /boot/vmlinuz-<version>

# mokutil --import-hash <hash value returned from pesign command>

# reboot

Q: If I don’t use Secure Boot, can I continue to boot into previous versions of the RHEL 7 and 8 kernels without any changes after applying this update to GRUB?

A: Yes, with Secure Boot option disabled no signature verification is performed thus previous kernel versions will still be bootable without any further required action.

Q: When will new DBX updates be applied into the UEFI firmware?

A: As a consequence of GRUB’s security flaw, the previous Red Hat Secure Boot signature will be revoked and placed into the Disallow DB (DBX) database, and a new signature will be used when customers apply the dbxtool update. A new DBX file is included in the update, that also contains the revocation for older Red Hat keys. However, the dbxupdate will not be performed by default and is targeted for IT professionals who want to exclude the older keys. A new, mandatory, and automatic dbxtool update will be released in the coming months to indefinitely revoke Red Hat keys for all Red Hat customers.

Q: The vulnerability affects program code that runs independent of the use of Secure Boot. How then does the vulnerability’s impact differ between Secure Boot-enabled systems and other systems?

A: The Secure Boot mechanism is designed to allow only unmodified, trusted and signed code to be loaded by the machine’s firmware and subsequent loader components. This means Secure Boot imposes an extra security boundary that works as a mitigation for any attempts to load untrusted software during the boot stage (boot loader, kernel and kernel modules). Since the GRUB 2 flaw allows arbitrary code execution, an attacker can leverage this to bypass any signature checking or run untrusted code crossing the security boundary imposed by Secure Boot, thus jeopardizing the integrity of the kernel loaded.

When Secure Boot is disabled no signature verification is performed; as a consequence there’s no additional security boundary to be crossed. Given this flaw allows any code to be loaded, this flaw for non-Secure Boot GRUB can be handled as any other flaw which allows arbitrary code execution.

Q: What should I do when the system hangs after POST and the grub menu never loads after applying the RHSA-2020:3216 or RHSA-2020:3217?

A: Refer to solution article, <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5272311>. On Saturday August 1st 2020 Red Hat released updated shim packages which addressed this issue. It is strongly recommended that Red Hat customers do not use the older shim package released as part of RHSA-2020:3216 or RHSA-2020:3217 and instead use the shim package (or newer) released with RHBA-2020:3262 and RHBA-2020:3265.

# What is UEFI?

UEFI is the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. See the main [UEFI](/UEFI) page for more details about it.

# What is UEFI Secure Boot?

UEFI Secure Boot (SB) is a verification mechanism for ensuring that code launched by a computer's UEFI firmware is trusted. It is designed to protect a system against malicious code being loaded and executed early in the boot process, before the operating system has been loaded.

SB works using cryptographic checksums and signatures. Each program that is loaded by the firmware includes a signature and a checksum, and before allowing execution the firmware will verify that the program is trusted by validating the checksum and the signature. When SB is enabled on a system, any attempt to execute an untrusted program will not be allowed. This stops unexpected / unauthorised code from running in the UEFI environment.

Most x86 hardware comes from the factory pre-loaded with Microsoft keys. This means the firmware on these systems will trust binaries that are signed by Microsoft. Most modern systems will ship with SB enabled - they will *not* run any unsigned code by default. Starting with Debian version 10 ("Buster"), Debian supports UEFI secure boot by employing a small UEFI loader called shim which is signed by Microsoft and embeds Debian's signing keys. This allows Debian to sign its own binaries without requiring further signatures from Microsoft. Older Debian versions did not support secure boot, so users had to disable secure boot in their machine's firmware configuration prior to installing those versions.

It is possible to change the firmware configuration to either disable SB or to enroll extra signing keys. This is not required when running standard kernels provided by Debian but may be useful to some users, for example when using custom kernel builds.

Most of the programs that are expected to run in the UEFI environment are boot loaders, but others exist too. There are also programs to deal with firmware updates before operating system startup (like [fwupdate](https://packages.debian.org/fwupdate "DebianPkg") and [fwupd](https://packages.debian.org/fwupd "DebianPkg")), and other utilities may live here too.

# What is UEFI Secure Boot NOT?

UEFI Secure Boot is **not** an attempt by Microsoft to lock Linux out of the PC market here; SB is a security measure to protect against malware during early system boot. Microsoft act as a Certification Authority (CA) for SB, and they will sign programs on behalf of other trusted organisations so that their programs will also run. There are certain identification requirements that organisations have to meet here, and code has to be audited for safety. But these are not too difficult to achieve.

SB is also **not** meant to lock users out of controlling their own systems. Users can enroll extra keys into the system, allowing them to sign programs for their own systems. Many SB-enabled systems also allow users to remove the platform-provided keys altogether, forcing the firmware to only trust user-signed binaries.

# Shim

[shim](https://packages.debian.org/shim "DebianPkg") is a simple software package that is designed to work as a first-stage bootloader on UEFI systems.

It was developed by a group of Linux developers from various distros, working together to make SB work using Free Software. It is a common piece of code that is safe, well-understood and audited so that it can be trusted and signed using platform keys. This means that Microsoft (or other potential firmware CA providers) only have to worry about signing shim, and not all of the other programs that distro vendors might want to support.

Shim then becomes the root of trust for all the other distro-provided UEFI programs. It embeds a further distro-specific CA key that is itself used for as a trust root for signing further programs (e.g. Linux, GRUB, fwupdate). This allows for a clean delegation of trust - the distros are then responsible for signing the rest of their packages. Shim itself should ideally not need to be updated very often, reducing the workload on the central auditing and CA teams.

For extra trust and safety, from version 15 onwards the shim binary build is 100% reproducible - you can rebuild the Debian shim binary yourself to verify that no unexpected changes have been embedded in this key piece of security software.

# Finding out information on your system

## Has the system booted via Secure Boot?

```
$ sudo mokutil --sb-state
SecureBoot enabled
```

**Note that you can be only sure that the above answer is correct if your system has not been tampered with in the first place.**

## What keys are on my system?

If you want to know what keys are in use on your system, various other mokutil calls will help, e.g. sudo mokutil --list-enrolled to show the current MOK key list. See the man page for more.

You can also see which keys your kernel knows about by looking in kernel boot messages.

First, the kernel will list keys included at build time, e.g. on current Debian kernels:

```
[    1.378223] Loading compiled-in X.509 certificates
[    1.395916] Loaded X.509 cert 'Debian Secure Boot CA: 6ccece7e4c6c0d1f6149f3dd27dfcc5cbb419ea1'
[    1.395954] Loaded X.509 cert 'Debian Secure Boot Signer 2022 - linux: 14011249c2675ea8e5148542202005810584b25f'
```

Second, the kernel will list the keys it has found in the UEFI key variables (DB, and MokListRT if SB is enabled). The following is example output from a Lenovo Thinkpad with SB enabled:

```
[    1.378223] Loading compiled-in X.509 certificates
[    1.398449] integrity: Loading X.509 certificate: UEFI:db
[    1.399705] integrity: Loaded X.509 cert 'Lenovo Ltd.: ThinkPad Product CA 2012: 838b1f54c1550463f45f98700640f11069265949'

```

# Finding Debian's SB keys

In normal use, you're unlikely to ever need these directly. But, in case they're useful, here's where to find them.

* The Debian UEFI CA cert is the root of trust, and can be found in our shim source package - [here](https://salsa.debian.org/efi-team/shim/-/raw/master/debian/debian-uefi-ca.der) in git.
* The public keys used directly for signing binaries are also found in git, in the ftp-team code-signing repo [here](https://salsa.debian.org/ftp-team/code-signing/-/tree/master/etc).

# MOK - Machine Owner Key

A key part of the shim design is to allow users to control their own systems. The Debian distro CA key is built in to the shim binary itself, but there is also an extra database of keys that can be managed by the user. The user keys are called **Machine Owner Key**, or MOK for short.

Keys can be added and removed in the MOK list by the user, entirely separate from the distro CA key. The **mokutil** utility can be used to help manage the keys here from Linux userland, but changes to the MOK keys may **only** be confirmed directly from the console at boot time. This removes the risk of userland malware potentially enrolling new keys and therefore bypassing the entire point of SB.

There are more docs online for how to work with MOK, for example:

* <https://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/secureboot.html#initial_shim>

## DKMS and secure boot

Debian uses the Dynamic Kernel Module System (DKMS) to allow individual kernel modules to be upgraded without changing the whole kernel. Since DKMS modules are compiled individually on users own machines, it is not possible to sign DKMS modules using the Debian project's signing keys. Instead, modules built using DKMS will be signed using a machine owner key (MOK), which by default is located at /var/lib/dkms/mok.key with the corresponding public key at /var/lib/dkms/mok.pub. This key is generated automatically but needs to be enrolled manually by running the following commands:

```
$ sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/dkms/mok.pub # prompts for one-time password
$ sudo mokutil --list-new # recheck your key will be prompted on next boot

<rebooting machine then enters MOK manager EFI utility: enroll MOK, continue, confirm, enter password, reboot>

$ sudo dmesg | grep cert # verify your key is loaded
```

### Virtualbox Packages

Unlike Debian, Ubuntu places their auto-generated MOK at "/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/" which some software--such as Oracle's virtualbox package (see [989463](https://bugs.debian.org/989463 "DebianBug"))--expect to be present.

Note that using this same location may result in future conflicts, but results in fewer surprises due to poor coding ([989463](https://bugs.debian.org/989463 "DebianBug")). Despite typically being poor practice, it is generally recommended to use the same location. More pedantic admins will likely prefer "/root/.mok/" ... with an understanding of expected headaches.

First make sure the key doesn't exist yet:

```
$ ls /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/
```

If you see the key there (consisting of the files MOK.der, MOK.pem and MOK.priv) then you can use these, rather than creating your own.

To create a custom MOK:

```
# mkdir -p /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/
# cd /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/
# openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout MOK.priv -outform DER -out MOK.der -days 36500 -subj "/CN=My Name/"
# openssl x509 -inform der -in MOK.der -out MOK.pem
```

**NOTE** It seems (2022-06-21) that shim won't support adding a 4096 RSA key to the [?](/MokList)MokList (it might freezes when loading and verifying the grubx64.efi binary), so make sure you use a 2048 key for now.

### Enrolling your key

Key enrollment requires issuing the request using mokutil and then confirming enrollment during a reboot. This is intended to ensure that only the device custodian can approve enrollment of a new MOK.

To enroll a key:

```
$ sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der # prompts for one-time password
```

At next reboot, the device firmware should launch it's MOK manager and prompt the user to review the new key and confirm it's enrollment, using the one-time password. Any kernel modules (or kernels) that have been signed with this MOK should now be loadable.

To verify the MOK was loaded correctly:

```
$ sudo mokutil --test-key /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der
/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der is already enrolled
```

### Adding your key to DKMS

In order for dkms to automatically sign kernel modules, it must be told which key to sign the module with. This is done by adding two configuration values to "/etc/dkms/framework.conf", adjusting paths as required:

```
mok_signing_key="/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.priv"
mok_certificate="/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der"
```

### DKMS Sign Helper

If these values are provided and dkms is able to build modules but does not attempt to sign them, then it is likely that sign\_tool is missing. This is more common in older and/or custom kernels.

In "/etc/dkms/framework.conf", add:
```
sign_tool="/etc/dkms/sign_helper.sh"
```

Create "/etc/dkms/sign\_helper.sh" with:
```
/lib/modules/"$1"/build/scripts/sign-file sha512 /root/.mok/client.priv /root/.mok/client.der "$2"
```

## Manually signing kernels and kernel modules

The commands in this section use some shared environment variables:

```
$ VERSION="$(uname -r)"
$ SHORT_VERSION="$(uname -r | cut -d . -f 1-2)"
$ MODULES_DIR=/lib/modules/$VERSION
$ KBUILD_DIR=/usr/lib/linux-kbuild-$SHORT_VERSION
```

### Using your key to sign your kernel

First, install [sbsigntool](https://packages.debian.org/sbsigntool "DebianPkg")

```
$ sbsign --key MOK.priv --cert MOK.pem "/boot/vmlinuz-$VERSION" --output "/boot/vmlinuz-$VERSION.tmp"
$ sudo mv "/boot/vmlinuz-$VERSION.tmp" "/boot/vmlinuz-$VERSION"
```

### Using your key to sign modules

Building and signing modules is **independent** of building and signing your own kernel. Debian packages that provide kernel modules will typically sign the modules automatically using DKMS, but if you want to sign a kernel module manually, you can do so as shown below.

The example below shows how to sign modules. Debian's dkms package puts those in the updates/dkms subdirectory of the modules directory while Oracle's [VirtualBox](/VirtualBox) puts them in the misc subdirectory, so you'll have to go to the modules directory accordingly:

```
$ cd "$MODULES_DIR/updates/dkms" # For dkms packages
$ cd "$MODULES_DIR/misc" # For Oracle packages
```

Securely record the passphrase for the private key:

```
$ echo -n "Passphrase for the private key: "
$ read -s KBUILD_SIGN_PIN
$ export KBUILD_SIGN_PIN
```

Sign just the [VirtualBox](/VirtualBox) module:

```
$ sudo --preserve-env=KBUILD_SIGN_PIN "$KBUILD_DIR"/scripts/sign-file sha256 /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.priv /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der vboxdrv.ko
```

Or sign all modules below the current directory:

```
$ find -name \*.ko | while read i; do sudo --preserve-env=KBUILD_SIGN_PIN "$KBUILD_DIR"/scripts/sign-file sha256 /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.priv /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der "$i" || break; done
```

If the modules are needed to boot your machine, make sure to update the initramfs, e.g. using
```
sudo update-initramfs -k all -u
```

## Verifying if a module is signed

```

```

## Disabling/re-enabling Secure Boot

In case it is difficult to control Secure Boot state through the EFI setup program, mokutil can also be used to disable or re-enable Secure Boot for operating systems loaded through shim and GRUB:

1. Run: mokutil --disable-validation or mokutil --enable-validation.
2. Choose a password between 8 and 16 characters long. Enter the same password to confirm it.
3. Reboot.
4. When prompted, press a key to perform MOK management.
5. Select "Change Secure Boot state".
6. Enter each requested character of your chosen password to confirm the change. Note that you have to press Return/Enter after each character.
7. Select "Yes".
8. Select "Reboot".

After doing mokutil --disable-validation, shim will disable secure boot and display "Booting in insecure mode". However, if one does that, it's possible that the kernel reboots just right when it start. To remove this behaving and re-enable secure boot validation, one way is to delete the EFI variable. This may depend on your EFI shell implementation, though for me, this is what worked:

```
efi> dmpstore -all -d MockSBState
```

Note that the -all is needed to access non-defaults guids variables.

# Supported architectures and packages

On each architecture, Debian includes various packages containing signed binaries:

| **Name** | **amd64** | **i386** | **arm64** | **Signed by** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **fwupd** | fwupd-amd64-signed | fwupd-i386-signed | fwupd-arm64-signed | Debian | Tools to manage UEFI firmware updates automatically |
| **fwupdate** | fwupdate-amd64-signed | fwupdate-i386-signed | fwupdate-arm64-signed | Debian | Tools to manage UEFI firmware updates manually (removed after Buster in favour of fwupd) |
| **grub** | grub-efi-amd64-signed | grub-efi-ia32-signed | grub-efi-arm64-signed | Debian | GRUB boot loader |
| **linux** | linux-image-\*-amd64 (\*) | linux-image-\*-686\* (\*) | linux-image-\*-arm64 (\*) | Debian | Linux kernel, various flavours |
| **shim** | shim-signed | shim-signed | shim-signed | Microsoft | Main shim binary |
| **shim-helpers** | shim-helpers-amd64-signed | shim-helpers-i386-signed | shim-helpers-arm64-signed | Debian | Shim helper binaries - [?](/MokManager)MokManager and [?](/FallBack)FallBack |
| **systemd-boot** | systemd-boot-efi-amd64-signed | - | systemd-boot-efi-arm64-signed | Debian | systemd-boot boot loader (NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS) |

(\*) The various linux-image packages in Debian are now signed by default. The *unsigned* packages are called linux-image-\*-unsigned.

# Secure Boot setup with systemd-boot

A signed systemd-boot package is at the time of writing not yet provided in the Debian archive. This section documents how the integration will work once the signed package becomes available. Expert users and downstreams can provide their own signed package to test this integration, but beware that bugs are to be expected at this stage.

GRUB is the default bootloader of choice in Debian, so the Secure Boot integration of systemd-boot has been designed with the intention of being a no-op if GRUB is installed on the target machine.

The integration point is the systemd-boot package and its postinst/prerm scripts. If GRUB packages are not installed, and both the shim-signed and systemd-boot-efi-[amd64|arm64]-signed packages are installed, then the maintainer scripts will run logic to install the appropriate EFI binaries to the ESP, and to add an EFI boot entry (named Debian) pointing to shim and making it the default entry. If either or both packages are removed, this logic runs in reverse and completely removes the binaries from the ESP, and deletes the EFI boot entry.

Dpkg triggers are declared by the systemd-boot package on the directories /usr/lib/grub and /usr/lib/shim, and on a named trigger systemd-boot-signed, so that the maintainer script can run the install/uninstall/update logic when the content of any of the involved packages changes.

A user wanting to switch from GRUB to systemd-boot should do so by removing the GRUB packages and installing systemd-boot at the same time, for example on an amd64 system:

```
# apt install systemd-boot grub-efi-amd64-signed-
```

To switch back to GRUB the inverse operation can be used:

```
# apt install systemd-boot- grub-efi-amd64-signed
```

To install systemd-boot on a system with no bootloader:

```
# apt install systemd-boot shim-signed
```

# Testing UEFI Secure Boot

In preparation for the Debian 10 (Buster) release, some tests were performed to make sure that everything was ready. The information about that is is [here](/SecureBoot/Testing).

# Secure Boot limitations

By its very design, SB may affect or limit some things that users want to do.

If you want to build and run your own kernel (e.g. for development or debugging), then you will obviously end up making binaries that are not signed with the Debian key. If you wish to use those binaries, you will need to either sign them yourself and enroll the key used with MOK or disable SB.

Using SB activates "lockdown" mode in the Linux kernel. This disables various features that can be used to modify the kernel:

* Loading kernel modules that are not signed by a trusted key. By default, this will block out-of-tree modules including DKMS-managed drivers. However, you can create your own signing key for modules and add its certificate to the trusted list using [MOK](/SecureBoot#MOK_-_Machine_Owner_Key).
* Using kexec to start an unsigned kernel image.
* Hibernation and resume from hibernation.
* User-space access to physical memory and I/O ports.
* Module parameters that allow setting memory and I/O port addresses.
* Writing to MSRs through /dev/cpu/\*/msr.
* Use of custom ACPI methods and tables.
* ACPI APEI error injection.

You can avoid this by disabling Secure Boot through the EFI setup program or through [MOK](/SecureBoot#MOK_-_Machine_Owner_Key).

# arm64 problems

Debian initially had support for UEFI Secure Boot on arm64 for buster (10.0), but we found problems and had to abandon it for some time. It was re-enabled and functional again for the bookworm release (12.0). Things should work so long as a system is using **shim-signed** version **1.39** and **grub2** version **2.06-9** or greater.

If you want to know more, here's the background:

For a long time, shim and other EFI programs were difficult to build on arm64 compared to x86 platforms. Binutils for amd64 and i386 includes explicit support for creating programs in the PE/COFF binary format that EFI uses, but similar support did not exist for arm64 until during the bookworm development cycle.

In the past, shim developers added some local hacks into the shim package to generate a **mostly**-compliant PE/COFF EFI binary without this toolchain support, and that seemed to be sufficient for use. Everything seemed to work. **However**, during the development and testing phase of shim 15.3 and 15.4, we found found significant issues with this approach. New security features needed in <https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot> shim (SBAT) showed up severe problems with the lack of proper toolchain support. See <https://github.com/rhboot/shim/issues/366> for more gory details. The old hacks around binutils were no longer sustainable.

Statistics tell us that very few people attempted to use arm64 Secure Boot with Debian at the time, so in the interests of releasing needed updates in a timely manner for other architectures we decided **temporarily** to disable SB support for Debian arm64.

Binutils 2.38 introduced support for PE/COFF generation on arm64 and the problem was solved.

## Details

Jesse Michael and Mickey Shkatov discovered that the configuration parser

in GRUB2 did not properly exit when errors were discovered, resulting in

heap-based buffer overflows. A local attacker could use this to execute

arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. ([CVE-2020-10713](/security/CVE-2020-10713))

Chris Coulson discovered that the GRUB2 function handling code did not

properly handle a function being redefined, leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code

and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. ([CVE-2020-15706](/security/CVE-2020-15706))

Chris Coulson discovered that multiple integer overflows existed in GRUB2

when handling certain filesystems or font files, leading to heap-based

buffer overflows. A local attacker could use these to execute arbitrary

code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. ([CVE-2020-14309](/security/CVE-2020-14309),

[CVE-2020-14310](/security/CVE-2020-14310), [CVE-2020-14311](/security/CVE-2020-14311))

It was discovered that the memory allocator for GRUB2 did not validate

allocation size, resulting in multiple integer overflows and heap-based

buffer overflows when handling certain filesystems, PNG images or disk

metadata. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code and

bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. ([CVE-2020-14308](/security/CVE-2020-14308))

Mathieu Trudel-Lapierre discovered that in certain situations, GRUB2

failed to validate kernel signatures. A local attacker could use this

to bypass Secure Boot restrictions. ([CVE-2020-15705](/security/CVE-2020-15705))

Colin Watson and Chris Coulson discovered that an integer overflow

existed in GRUB2 when handling the initrd command, leading to a heap-based

buffer overflow. A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code

and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. ([CVE-2020-15707](/security/CVE-2020-15707))

Fully mitigating these vulnerabilities requires both an updated

GRUB2 boot loader and the application of a UEFI Revocation

List (dbx) to system firmware. Ubuntu will provide a packaged

dbx update at a later time, though system adminstrators may

choose to apply a third party dbx update before then. For more

details on mitigation steps and the risks entailed (especially for

dual/multi-boot scenarios), please see the Knowledge Base article at

<https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/GRUB2SecureBootBypass>

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryGRUB2 Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-grub2-code-exec-xLePCAPY  First Published: 2020 August 4 23:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2020 August 10 15:49 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Interim](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#interim)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  CVE-2020-10713     CWE-119          CVE-2020-10713     CWE-119       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-grub2-code-exec-xLePCAPY/csaf/cisco-sa-grub2-code-exec-xLePCAPY.json)   Email      Summary  * On July 29, 2020, a research paper titled “There’s a Hole in the Boot” was made publicly available. This paper discusses a vulnerability discovered in the GRand Unified Bootloader version 2 (GRUB2) bootloader that may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code at system boot time.  The vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain values parsed from the GRUB2 configuration file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted configuration file for GRUB2. When this file is processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary code that is executed before the operating system is loaded on the targeted system.  On systems protected by the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) secure boot feature, exploitation of this vulnerability may allow the attacker to tamper with the secure boot process.  Multiple Cisco products are affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability. Any workarounds for a specific Cisco product or service will be documented in the relevant Cisco bugs, which are identified in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory.  This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-grub2-code-exec-xLePCAPY>  Affected Products  * The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.  The [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product or service. The bugs are accessible through the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID) and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.  Any product or service not listed in the [Products Under Investigation](#pui) or [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory is to be considered not vulnerable. Because this is an ongoing investigation, please be aware that products and services that are currently considered not vulnerable may subsequently be considered vulnerable as additional information becomes available.    Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco Products if they implement a vulnerable release of the GRUB2 bootloader and do not validate the GRUB2 configuration file.  The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory. If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the Last Updated date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.       | Product | Cisco Bug ID | [Fixed Release Availability](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Routing and Switching - Enterprise and Service Provider | | |   | Cisco Cloud Services Router 1000V Series | [CSCvv04959](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv04959) |  |   | Cisco Integrated Services Virtual Router (ISRv) | [CSCvv04959](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv04959) |  |   | Network and Content Security Devices | | |   | Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) | [CSCvv04957](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv04957) |  |   | Unified Computing | | |   | Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) | [CSCvv05161](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv05161) |  |      Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products and services listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following products and services.  *Network and Content Security Devices*    + Cisco Firepower Management System *Routing and Switching - Enterprise and Service Provider*    + Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers   + Cisco IR800 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)  Details  * This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that integrate a vulnerable release of the GRUB2 bootloader. The bootloader is software that is executed during the system startup process; it is initialized by the system firmware and performs the necessary initialization for loading the operating system. GRUB2 reads its configuration parameters from a text file. An affected version of GRUB2 improperly performs the bounds checking of specific values parsed from the configuration file.  An attacker who can modify this configuration file (by possessing either administrative privileges to the device or physical access to the targeted system) could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted configuration file for GRUB2. When this file is processed, a heap-based buffer overflow may occur. The attacker could use this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution in the preboot environment of an affected system.  Exploitation of this vulnerability would require an attacker to modify the GRUB2 configuration file. Most Cisco devices validate the GRUB2 configuration file during the boot process. An attempt to exploit this vulnerability will cause the digital signature check to fail. When this check fails, the Cisco device will not let that software boot, thereby preventing the malicious code from running.  On a subset of Cisco devices, the GRUB2 configuration file is not validated. These products are affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory, and listed in [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section.  Workarounds  * Any workarounds for a specific Cisco product or service will be documented in the relevant Cisco bugs, which are identified in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory.  Fixed Software  * For information about [fixed software releases](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), consult the Cisco bugs identified in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is aware that proof-of-concept exploit code is available for the vulnerability described in this advisory.

# There's a Hole in the Boot

By:
Eclypsium

July 29, 2020

![Worm Coming out of a Boot](https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/Eclypsium-Research-Boothole.jpg)

*“BootHole” vulnerability in the GRUB2 bootloader opens up Windows and Linux devices using Secure Boot to attack. All operating systems using GRUB2 with Secure Boot must release new installers and bootloaders.*

Join Eclypsium for a recorded webinar “[Managing The Hole In Secure Boot](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17865/430345?utm_source=Eclypsium&utm_medium=brighttalk&utm_campaign=430345)“, where CEO Yuriy Bulygin and VP R&D John Loucaides explain the BootHole vulnerability and provide advice on mitigation.

## Introduction

Eclypsium researchers, Mickey Shkatov and Jesse Michael, have discovered a vulnerability — dubbed “BootHole” — in the GRUB2 bootloader utilized by most Linux systems that can be used to gain arbitrary code execution during the boot process, even when Secure Boot is enabled. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can install persistent and stealthy bootkits or malicious bootloaders that could give them near-total control over the victim device.

The vulnerability affects systems using Secure Boot, even if they are not using GRUB2. Almost all signed versions of GRUB2 are vulnerable, meaning virtually every Linux distribution is affected. In addition, GRUB2 supports other operating systems, kernels and hypervisors such as Xen. The problem also extends to any Windows device that uses Secure Boot with the standard Microsoft Third Party UEFI Certificate Authority. Thus the majority of laptops, desktops, servers and workstations are affected, as well as network appliances and other special purpose equipment used in industrial, healthcare, financial and other industries. This vulnerability makes these devices susceptible to attackers such as the [threat actors recently discovered](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1275770256389222400) using malicious UEFI bootloaders.

Eclypsium has coordinated the responsible disclosure of this vulnerability with a variety of industry entities, including OS vendors, computer manufacturers, and CERTs. Mitigation will require new bootloaders to be signed and deployed, and vulnerable bootloaders should be revoked to prevent adversaries from using older, vulnerable versions in an attack. This will likely be a long process and take considerable time for organizations to complete patching.

## Background: Secure Boot, GRUB2, and CAs

Secure Boot can be a fairly deep and technical topic. Our goal here is to give a high-level introduction to the key concepts relevant to this research without going into all the granular details. We have included a variety of external links to provide additional information for those interested. Alternatively, you can go straight to the [description of the vulnerability](#breaking) itself.

### Threats to the Boot Process

The boot process is one of the most fundamentally important aspects of security for any device. It relies on a variety of firmware that controls how a device’s various components and peripherals are initialized and ultimately coordinates the loading of the operating system itself. In general, the earlier code is loaded, the more privileged it is.

If this process is compromised, attackers can control how the operating system is loaded and subvert all higher-layer security controls. Recent research has identified ransomware in the wild using [malicious EFI bootloaders](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1275770256389222400) as a way to take control of machines at the time of boot. Previously threat actors used malware tampering with legacy OS bootloaders including  [APT41 Rockboot](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0112/), [LockBit](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/04/24/lockbit-ransomware-borrows-tricks-to-keep-up-with-revil-and-maze/), [FIN1 Nemesis](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/nemesis-malware-hijacks-pcs-boot-process-to-gain-stealth-persistence/), [MBR-ONI](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/night-of-the-devil-ransomware-or-wiper-a-look-into-targeted-attacks-in-japan), [Petya/NotPetya](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-181A), and [Rovnix](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.rovnix).

Additional information on threats to the modern PC boot process is available in the “[Bootkits and UEFI Secure Boot](https://github.com/abazhaniuk/firmware-security-training/blob/master/BIOS-UEFI-Security.2-BootkitsSecureBoot.pdf)” section of the System Firmware training.

### UEFI Secure Boot

UEFI Secure Boot was originally developed by the UEFI Forum as a way to protect the boot process from these types of attacks. There are other implementations of secure boot designed for different environments, but UEFI Secure Boot is the standard for PCs and servers. The goal is to prevent malicious code from being introduced into the boot process by cryptographically checking each piece of firmware and software before it is run. Any code not recognized as valid is not executed in the boot process.

Secure Boot uses cryptographic signatures to verify the integrity of each piece of code as it is needed during the boot process. There are two critical databases involved in this process: the Allow DB (db) of approved components and the Disallow DB (dbx) of vulnerable or malicious components, including firmware, drivers, and bootloaders. Access to modify these databases is protected by a Key Exchange Key (KEK), which in turn is verified by a Platform Key (PK). Although the PK is used as a root of trust for updates to the platform, it’s not expressly part of the boot process (but is shown below for reference). It is dbx, db, and KEK that are used to verify the signatures for loaded executables at boot time.

![](https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/bh_diagram_1.png)

Additional details on the Secure Boot process can be found in this [PDF](http://www.c7zero.info/stuff/Windows8SecureBoot_Bulygin-Furtak-Bazhniuk_BHUSA2013.pdf).

### Chains of Trust and GRUB2

Next, OEMs must manage a list of who is permitted to sign code trusted by the Secure Boot Database. Instead of having every OEM manage certificates from every possible firmware, driver, or OS provider, Secure Boot allows for the use of a centralized Certificate Authority (CA). Microsoft’s 3rd Party UEFI CA provides the industry standard signing service for Secure Boot. In short, third parties can submit their code to Microsoft, and Microsoft will validate and sign the code with the Microsoft CA. This establishes a chain of trust that only requires OEMs to enroll the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA to their platforms to enable them to boot third-party installation media and operating systems by default when Secure Boot is enabled.

This includes the ability to sign bootloaders from non-Microsoft operating systems such as Linux. In almost every modern Linux distribution, GRUB (the Grand Unified Bootloader) is the bootloader that loads and transfers control to the operating system. In this document, all references to GRUB are intended to refer to GRUB2, which was a complete rewrite from the previous version commonly referred to as “GRUB Legacy.” Starting in 2009, all widely used Linux distributions have transitioned to using GRUB2. GRUB Legacy has been deprecated and is generally only found in older releases.

[Due to legal issues arising from license incompatibilities](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/hardware-dev-center/updated-uefi-signing-requirements/ba-p/1062916), open-source projects and other third parties build a small application called a “shim,” which contains the vendor’s certificate and code that verifies and runs the bootloader (GRUB2). The vendor’s shim is verified using the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA and then the shim loads and verifies the GRUB2 bootloader using the vendor certificate embedded inside itself.

![](https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/bh_diagram_2.png)

Additional detail on the role of the Microsoft UEFI CA in the boot process is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-secure-boot-key-creation-and-management-guidance).

### Challenges of Secure Boot

As with any technical process, Secure Boot is not without its potential problems. The process involves many pieces of code, and a vulnerability in any one of them presents a single point of failure that could allow an attacker to bypass Secure Boot. Additionally, although UEFI Secure Boot attempts to provide certain integrity guarantees to the boot process, other misconfigurations of the hardware or missing protection features can undermine boot security. One such example is a [DMA attack](https://eclypsium.com/research/direct-memory-access-attacks-a-walk-down-memory-lane/) using tools such as [PCIe Microblaze](https://github.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze). Additionally, as we will show in this blog post, a vulnerability in the boot process that enables arbitrary code execution can allow attackers to control the boot process and operating system, even when secure boot signatures are verified.

Attackers can also use a vulnerable bootloader against the system. For example, if a valid bootloader was found to have a vulnerability, a piece of malware could replace the device’s existing bootloader with the vulnerable version. The bootloader would be allowed by Secure Boot and give the malware complete control over the system and OS. Mitigating this requires very active management of the dbx database used to identify malicious or vulnerable code.

![](https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/diagram_3_newr-1024x247-2.png)

Additionally, updates and fixes to the Secure Boot process can be particularly complex and run the risk of inadvertently [breaking machines](https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-pulls-uefi-related-windows-update-after-users-report-problems). The boot process naturally involves a variety of players and components including device OEMs, operating system vendors, and administrators. Given the fundamental nature of the boot process, any sort of problems run a high risk of rendering a device unusable. As a result, updates to Secure Boot are typically slow and require extensive industry testing.

## Breaking Secure Boot Through GRUB2

In the course of Eclypsium’s analysis, we have identified a buffer overflow vulnerability in the way that GRUB2 parses content from the GRUB2 config file (grub.cfg). Of note: The GRUB2 config file is a text file and typically is not signed like other files and executables. This vulnerability enables arbitrary code execution within GRUB2 and thus control over the booting of the operating system. As a result, an attacker could modify the contents of the GRUB2 configuration file to ensure that attack code is run before the operating system is loaded. In this way, attackers gain persistence on the device.

Such an attack would require an attacker to have elevated privileges. However, it would provide the attacker with a powerful additional escalation of privilege and persistence on the device, even with Secure Boot enabled and properly performing signature verification on all loaded executables. One of the explicit design goals of Secure Boot is to prevent unauthorized code, even running with administrator privileges, from gaining additional privileges and pre-OS persistence by disabling Secure Boot or otherwise modifying the boot chain.

With the sole exception of one bootable tool vendor who added custom code to perform a signature verification of the grub.cfg config file in addition to the signature verification performed on the GRUB2 executable, all versions of GRUB2 that load commands from an external grub.cfg configuration file are vulnerable. As such, this will require the release of new installers and bootloaders for all versions of Linux. Vendors will need to release new versions of their bootloader shims to be signed by the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA. It is important to note that until all affected versions are added to the dbx revocation list, an attacker would be able to use a vulnerable version of shim and GRUB2 to attack the system. This means that every device that trusts the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA will be vulnerable for that period of time.

In addition to vendors using shims signed by the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA, some OEMs that control both the hardware and the software stack in their devices use their own key that is provisioned into the hardware at the factory to sign GRUB2 directly. They will need to provide updates and revocation of previous vulnerable versions of GRUB2 for these systems as well.

This vulnerability was assigned CVE-2020-10713 “GRUB2: crafted grub.cfg file can lead to arbitrary code execution during boot process” with a CVSS rating of 8.2 (High) / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.

Follow these links to go directly to the [Impact](#impacts) and [Mitigations](#mitigation) sections.

### Vulnerability Analysis

The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that occurs in GRUB2 when parsing the grub.cfg file. This configuration file is an external file commonly located in the EFI System Partition and can therefore be modified by an attacker with administrator privileges without altering the integrity of the signed vendor shim and GRUB2 bootloader executables. The buffer overflow allows the attacker to gain arbitrary code execution within the UEFI execution environment, which could be used to run malware, alter the boot process, directly patch the OS kernel, or execute any number of other malicious actions.

To dig a little deeper into the vulnerability itself, we’ll take a closer look at how the code works internally. In order to process commands from the external configuration file, GRUB2 uses flex and bison to generate a parsing engine for a domain-specific language (DSL) from language description files and helper functions.

This is generally considered to be a better approach than manually writing a custom parser for each DSL. However, GRUB2, flex, and bison are all complex software packages with their own design assumptions that can be easy to overlook. And those mismatched design assumptions can result in vulnerable code.

The parser engine generated by flex includes this define as part of the token processing code:

```
#define YY_DO_BEFORE_ACTION \
    yyg->yytext_ptr = yy_bp; \
    yyleng = (int) (yy_cp - yy_bp); \
    yyg->yy_hold_char = *yy_cp; \
    *yy_cp = '\0'; \
    if ( yyleng >= YYLMAX ) \
        YY_FATAL_ERROR( "token too large, exceeds YYLMAX" ); \
    yy_flex_strncpy( yytext, yyg->yytext_ptr, yyleng + 1 , yyscanner); \
    yyg->yy_c_buf_p = yy_cp;

```

In this macro, the generated code detects that it has encountered a token that is too large to fit into flex’s internal parse buffer and calls `YY_FATAL_ERROR()`, which is a helper function provided by the software that is using the flex-generated parser.

However, the `YY_FATAL_ERROR()` implementation provided in the GRUB2 software package is:

```
#define YY_FATAL_ERROR(msg)                     \
  do {                                          \
    grub_printf (_("fatal error: %s\n"), _(msg));     \
  } while (0)

```

Rather than halting execution or exiting, it just prints an error to the console and returns to the calling function. Unfortunately, the flex code has been written with the expectation that any calls to `YY_FATAL_ERROR()` will never return. This results in `yy_flex_strncpy()` being called and copying the source string from the configuration file into a buffer that is too small to contain it.

![](https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/bh_diagram_4-1024x696-1.png)

Beyond just this specific path, a number of additional places throughout the flex-generated code also expect that any calls to `YY_FATAL_ERROR()` never return and perform unsafe operations when that expectation is broken. Mismatched assumptions between producers and consumers of an API are a very common source of vulnerabilities.

Ultimately, by providing a configuration file with input tokens that are too long to be handled by the parser, this buffer overflow overwrites critical structures in the heap. These overwritten fields include internal parser structure elements, which can be used as an arbitrary write-what-where primitive to gain arbitrary code execution and hijack the boot process.

![](https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/bh_diagram_5-1024x891-1.png)

Of further note, the UEFI execution environment does not have Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) or Data Execution Prevention (DEP/NX) or other exploit mitigation technologies typically found in modern operating systems, so creating exploits for this kind of vulnerability is significantly easier. The heap is fully executable without the need to build ROP chains.

Finally, rather than being architecture-specific, this vulnerability is in a common code path and was also confirmed using a signed ARM64 version of GRUB2.

### Additional Vulnerabilities

There have been a couple of examples of previous vulnerabilities found in GRUB2 that result in arbitrary code execution, but with a much smaller scope.

In April 2019, a vulnerability in how GRUB2 was used by the Kaspersky Rescue Disk was [publicly disclosed](https://habr.com/en/post/446238/). In February 2020, more than six months after a fixed version had been released, Microsoft pushed an update to revoke the vulnerable bootloader across all Windows systems by updating the UEFI revocation list (dbx) to block the known-vulnerable Kaspersky bootloader. Unfortunately, this resulted in systems from multiple vendors encountering unexpected errors, including bricked devices, and the [update was removed from the update servers](https://www.windowslatest.com/2020/02/15/windows-10-kb4524244-issues/).

Additionally, in May 2020, Dmytro Oleksiuk [disclosed](https://twitter.com/d_olex/status/1264238411679887360) that certain HPE ProLiant servers contained a version of GRUB2 signed by a HP CA that allows the use of the “insmod” command to load unsigned code. This issue was assigned CVE-2020-7205 and is also embargoed until July 29th.

In response to our initial vulnerability report, additional scrutiny was applied to the GRUB2 code and a number of additional vulnerabilities were discovered by the Canonical security team:

* **CVE-2020-14308 GRUB2:** grub\_malloc does not validate allocation size allowing for arithmetic overflow and subsequent heap-based buffer overflow
  + 6.4 (Medium) / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
* **CVE-2020-14309 GRUB2:** Integer overflow in grub\_squash\_read\_symlink may lead to heap based overflow
  + 5.7 (Medium) / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
* **CVE-2020-14310 GRUB2:** Integer overflow read\_section\_from\_string may lead to heap based overflow
  + 5.7 (Medium) / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
* **CVE-2020-14311 GRUB2:** Integer overflow in grub\_ext2\_read\_link leads to heap based buffer overflow,
  + 5.7 (Medium) / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
* **CVE-2020-15705 GRUB2:** avoid loading unsigned kernels when grub is booted directly under secure boot without shim
  + 6.4 (Medium) /CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
* **CVE-2020-15706 GRUB2 script:** Avoid a use-after-free when redefining a function during execution
  + 6.4 (Medium) /CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
* **CVE-2020-15707 GRUB2:** Integer overflow in initrd size handling.
  + 5.7 (Medium) /CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

Given the difficulty of this kind of ecosystem-wide update/revocation, there is a strong desire to avoid having to do it again six months later. To that end, a large effort — spanning multiple security teams at Oracle, Red Hat, Canonical, VMware, and Debian — using static analysis tools and manual review helped identify and fix dozens of further vulnerabilities and dangerous operations throughout the codebase that do not yet have individual CVEs assigned.

### Impact

Due to a weakness in the way GRUB2 parses its configuration file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code that bypasses signature verification. The Boot Hole vulnerability discovered by Eclypsium can be used to install persistent and stealthy bootkits or malicious bootloaders that operate even when Secure Boot is enabled and functioning correctly. This can ensure attacker code runs before the operating system and can allow the attacker to control how the operating system is loaded, directly patch the operating system, or even direct the bootloader to alternate OS images. It gives the attacker virtually unlimited control over the victim device. Malicious bootloaders have recently been [observed in the wild](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1275770256389222400), and this vulnerability would make devices susceptible to these types of threats.

All signed versions of GRUB2 that read commands from an external grub.cfg file are vulnerable, affecting every Linux distribution. To date, more than 80 shims are known to be affected. In addition to Linux systems, any system that uses Secure Boot with the standard Microsoft UEFI CA is vulnerable to this issue. As a result, we believe that the majority of modern systems in use today, including servers and workstations, laptops and desktops, and a large number of Linux-based OT and IoT systems, are potentially affected by these vulnerabilities.

Additionally, any hardware root of trust mechanisms that rely on UEFI Secure Boot could be bypassed as well.

## Mitigation

Full mitigation of this issue will require coordinated efforts from a variety of entities: affected open-source projects, Microsoft, and the owners of affected systems, among others. This will include:

1. Updates to GRUB2 to address the vulnerability.
2. Linux distributions and other vendors using GRUB2 will need to update their installers, bootloaders, and shims.
3. New shims will need to be signed by the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA.
4. Administrators of affected devices will need to update installed versions of operating systems in the field as well as installer images, including disaster recovery media.
5. Eventually the [UEFI revocation list (dbx)](https://uefi.org/revocationlistfile) needs to be updated in the firmware of each affected system to prevent running this vulnerable code during boot.

On the Coordinated Release Date (CRD) of July 29, we expect to see advisories and/or updates from the following affected parties:

* Microsoft
* UEFI Security Response Team (USRT)
* Oracle
* Red Hat (Fedora and RHEL)
* Canonical (Ubuntu)
* SuSE (SLES and openSUSE)
* Debian
* Citrix
* VMware
* Various OEMs
* Software vendors, including security software, are also impacted by this vulnerability and will be updating their bootloaders.
* … more to be added once we have a full list …

However, full deployment of this revocation process will likely be very slow. UEFI-related updates have had a [history of making devices unusable](https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-pulls-uefi-related-windows-update-after-users-report-problems), and vendors will need to be very cautious. If the revocation list (dbx) is updated before a given Linux bootloader and shim are updated, then the operating system will not load. As a result, updates to the revocation list will take place over time to prevent breaking systems that have yet to be updated. There are also edge cases where updating the dbx can be difficult, such as with dual-boot or deprovisioned machines. When any OS is installed or launched, the bootloader and OS need to be updated before the revocation is applied to the system.

Further complicating matters, enterprise disaster recovery processes can run into issues where approved recovery media no longer boots on a system if dbx updates have been applied. In addition when a device swap is needed due to failing hardware, new systems of the same model may have already had dbx updates applied and will fail when attempting to boot previously-installed operating systems. Before dbx updates are pushed out to enterprise fleet systems, recovery and installation media must be updated and verified as well.

Microsoft will be releasing a set of signed dbx updates, which can be applied to systems to block shims that can be used to load the vulnerable versions of GRUB2. Due to the risk of bricking systems or otherwise breaking operational or recovery workflows, these dbx updates will initially be made available for interested parties to manually apply to their systems rather than pushing the revocation entries and applying them automatically. This will allow IT professionals, enthusiasts, and others the opportunity to test the revocation updates on their individual systems and identify any issues before making the revocations mandatory.

Organizations should additionally ensure they have appropriate capabilities for monitoring UEFI bootloaders and firmware and verifying UEFI configurations, including revocation lists, in their systems. Organizations should also test recovery capabilities as updates become available, including the “reset to factory defaults” functionality in the UEFI setup. This will ensure that they can recover devices if a device is negatively impacted by an update. Finally, organizations should be monitoring their systems for threats and ransomware that use vulnerable bootloaders to infect or damage systems.

### Recommendations

1. Right away, start monitoring the contents of the bootloader partition (EFI system partition). This will buy time for the rest of the process and help identify affected systems in your environment. For those who have deployed the Eclypsium solution, you can see this monitoring under the “MBR/Bootloader” component of a device.
2. Continue to install OS updates as usual across desktops, laptops, servers, and appliances. Attackers can leverage privilege escalation flaws in the OS and applications to take advantage of this vulnerability so preventing them from gaining administrative level access to your systems is critical. Systems are still vulnerable after this, but it is a necessary first step. Once the revocation update is installed later, the old bootloader should stop working. This includes rescue disks, installers, enterprise gold images, virtual machines, or other bootable media.
3. Test the revocation list update. Be sure to specifically test the same firmware versions and models that are used in the field. It may help to update to the latest firmware first in order to reduce the number of test cases.
4. To close this vulnerability, you need to deploy the revocation update. Make sure that all bootable media has received OS updates first, roll it out slowly to only a small number of devices at a time, and incorporate lessons learned from testing as part of this process.
5. Engage with your third-party vendors to validate they are aware of, and are addressing, this issue. They should provide you a response as to its applicability to the services/solutions they provide you as well as their plans for remediation of this high rated vulnerability.

Eclypsium has [powershell and bash scripts available](https://github.com/eclypsium/BootHole/) which can be used to detect bootloaders that are being revoked by this dbxupdate.

## Conclusions

While Secure Boot is easily taken for granted by most users, it is the foundation of security within most devices. Once compromised, attackers can gain virtually complete control over the device, its operating system, and its applications and data. And as this research shows, when problems are found in the boot process, they can have far-reaching effects across many types of devices.

We will update this blog post as more information becomes available, and we encourage users and administrators to closely monitor alerts and notifications from their hardware vendors, the [Microsoft MSRC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc), and any relevant open-source projects.

### **July 30 Important Update**

Some of the Linux distribution updates appear to be leading to unsuccessful reboots. The developers and distribution maintainers are working to provide new updates. The maintainers are recommending to avoid installing updates for grub2, shim, and other bootloader-related applications until new packages are available. Some of the issues to watch are listed below:

## GRUB legacy no longer supported

2012-07-20 - Ronald van Haren

GRUB 2.x has moved to `[core]`. With this move support for GRUB legacy
(i.e. version 0.9x) is dropped, which is now moved to AUR.

Although GRUB legacy will not be removed from your system and will
stay fully functional, you should consider upgrading to GRUB version
2.x, or one of the other supported bootloaders.

Please consult [the GRUB wiki
page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Grub) for detailed installation instructions for GRUB version 2.x.

CVE-2019-20810
## GRUB2 UEFI Secure Boot Bypass (aka There’s a Hole in the Boot/BootHole) (CVE-2020-10713)

It was [discovered](https://www.eclypsium.com/2020/07/29/theres-a-hole-in-the-boot/) that GRUB2 contained various vulnerabilities that would allow UEFI Secure Boot to be bypassed. A local attacker with administrative privileges (or with physical access to the system) could use this issue to circumvent GRUB2 module signature checking, resulting in the ability to load arbitrary GRUB2 modules that have not been signed by a trusted authority and hence bypass UEFI Secure Boot.

A number of separate CVEs were allocated for these various vulnerabilities:

| **CVE** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2020-10713 | Crafted grub.cfg file can lead to arbitrary code execution during boot process |
| CVE-2020-14308 | grub\_malloc does not validate allocation size allowing for arithmetic overflow and subsequent heap-based buffer overflow. |
| CVE-2020-14309 | Integer overflow in grub\_squash\_read\_symlink may lead to heap based overflow. |
| CVE-2020-14310 | Integer overflow in read\_section\_from\_string may lead to heap based overflow. |
| CVE-2020-14311 | Integer overflow in grub\_ext2\_read\_link leads to heap based buffer overflow. |
| CVE-2020-15705 | Failure to validate kernel signature when booted without shim |
| CVE-2020-15706 | Use-after-free in grub\_script\_function\_create |
| CVE-2020-15707 | Integer overflows in efilinux grub\_cmd\_initrd and grub\_initrd\_init leads to heap based buffer overflow |

### DBX Update

Remediation of this vulnerability involves not only updated versions of grub2, but also an update to the UEFI Secure Boot DBX entries so that previously released vulnerable versions of grub2 are denied from being loaded. In the case of Ubuntu, this is achieved by adding the 2012 Canonical UEFI on-line signing key to the UEFI DBX as this was used to sign all grub2 binaries with this vulnerability. Fixed grub2 binaries are now signed by a new 2017 Canonical UEFI on-line signing key. The update for the UEFI DBX will be provided by an updated version of the secureboot-db package in Ubuntu at a later date, once this has undergone validation.

For users wishing to apply the DBX update before this is released for Ubuntu, it can be obtained from the [UEFI Forum Revocation List File](https://uefi.org/revocationlistfile).

Dual-boot and multi-boot users need to take special care to update all their operating systems before installing DBX updates, whether received from Ubuntu, another operating system, or via the UEFI Forum. Updating the DBX list is similar to a BIOS update: Secure Boot is a feature of the motherboard and is shared in common among all operating systems on the computer.

An update from another operating system may include DBX updates that will prevent you from booting unrelated operating systems. We expect other operating systems to release staggered updates that will provide new GRUB bootloaders before they release DBX updates. We do not know when other operating system vendors will release DBX updates. Ubuntu currently plans to release our DBX update in the near future.

Please plan to boot into every operating system on your multi-boot systems and install updates as soon as your other operating system distributions publish updates for this issue.

### 16.04 LTS FIPS

Currently, the versions of grub2 / grub2-signed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS do not enforce Secure Boot signature verification because the Linux kernel provided for 16.04 LTS FIPS is not signed. In conjunction with the remediation of this issue, the forthcoming re-certified FIPS kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS will be signed and grub2 / grub2-signed packages \*will\* enforce Secure Boot validation of the kernel. Until this updated kernel is available for 16.04 LTS FIPS customers, it is advised that for customers who have Secure Boot enabled with 16.04 LTS FIPS, to pin the FIPS repository on their machine to avoid grub2 / grub2-signed updates as follows:
```
$ cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/ubuntu-fips
Package: *
Pin: release o=LP-PPA-ubuntu-advantage-fips, n=xenial
Pin-Priority: 1001
EOF
$ sudo apt-get update
```

### Fixed versions

This issue was fixed in grub2 in 2.06. Ubuntu 14.04 ESM, 16.04 LTS, 18.04 LTS and 20.04 LTS were affected. To address the issue, ensure that the appropriate versions of the grub2 and grub2-signed are installed. These updates were announced in [USN 4432-1](http://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4432-1).

These versions are signed with a new key and fix the discovered errors that would allow secureboot bypass:

| **Release** | **grub2 Version** | **grub2-signed Version** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 20.04 LTS | [grub2 2.04-1ubuntu26.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/2.04-1ubuntu26.1) | [grub2-signed 1.142.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/1.142.3) |
| 18.04 LTS | [grub2 2.02-2ubuntu8.16](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/2.02-2ubuntu8.16) | [grub2-signed 1.93.18](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/1.93.18) |
| 16.04 LTS | [grub2 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.26) | [grub2-signed 1.66.26](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/1.66.26) |
| 14.04 ESM | [grub2 2.02~beta2-9ubuntu1.20](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/2.02~beta2-9ubuntu1.20) | [grub2-signed 1.34.22](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/1.34.22) |

Some users on cloud providers, legacy BIOS computers, or UEFI configured to boot with legacy support, have reported problems booting with the above versions. If you installed the above versions but have not yet rebooted, please double-check that debconf knows where your grub should be installed:

```
sudo apt install debconf-utils
sudo debconf-get-selections | grep -E 'grub-(efi|pc)/install_devices[^_]'
```

Use dpkg-reconfigure to repair the configuration:

```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc
```

(Alternatively, you can simply run sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc without checking first. It is harmless to run this multiple times.)

The following versions no longer reinstall grub when grub-pc is upgraded, to reduce the chance of regression due to [bug 1889556](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/%2Bbug/1889556). These updates were announced in [USN 4432-2](http://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4432-2).

| **Release** | **grub2 Version** | **grub2-signed Version** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 20.04 LTS | [grub2 2.04-1ubuntu26.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/2.04-1ubuntu26.2) | [grub2-signed 1.142.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/1.142.3) |
| 18.04 LTS | [grub2 2.02-2ubuntu8.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/2.02-2ubuntu8.17) | [grub2-signed 1.93.18](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/1.93.18) |
| 16.04 LTS | [grub2 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.27) | [grub2-signed 1.66.26](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/1.66.26) |

### Recovery

In the unlikely case that updating grub2/grub2-signed results in boot failure, the system can be recovered by downgrading grub2/grub2-signed from a separate running Ubuntu session. In the case of a physical machine, this can be done via the bootable Ubuntu Live CD / USB installer. In the case of a machine in the cloud, a separate instance on the same cloud availability-zone is required. In both cases, the final steps are the same - mount the root volume / device from the affected system into the livecd / separate cloud instance, chroot into this and use apt to downgrade grub2/grub2-signed:

#### Prepare the chroot

Preparing the chroot will be different depending on if this is a physical install or cloud instance.

##### Physical machine

1. [Create a bootable Ubuntu CD/DVD/USB image](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials?topic=desktop) and then when booting this, select ‘Try Ubuntu without installing’. You can find current installation media at <http://releases.ubuntu.com/> and old installation media at <http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/>.
2. Within the livecd environment, mount the root partition from the affected disk as well as various ephemeral file-systems, and chroot into it:
   ```
   $ sudo mount $ROOT_PARTITION /mnt # see with ‘gdisk -l /dev/<device>
   $ for i in /sys /proc /run /dev /dev/pts ; do sudo mount --bind "$i" "/mnt$i"; done
   $ sudo mv /mnt/etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf.bak # will restore later
   $ sudo cp -L /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/
   $ sudo chroot /mnt
   $ mount /boot/efi
   ```

##### Cloud instances (e.g. AWS EC2)

These instructions use AWS EC2 as an example but the process is similar in other clouds where the root disk can be detached from the VM. Google Compute Environment instructions can be found at <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/detach-reattach-boot-disk>. Azure requires deleting the VM to attach the root disk to a separate instance for recovery, those instructions can be found at <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/mckittrick/how-to-delete-a-vm-and-attach-the-os-disk-as-a-data-disk-to-a-recovery-vm-arm>.

1. Create a second cloud instance (if one does not already exist) in the same availability zone as the affected machine
2. Determine the root EBS volume of the affected instance, stop that instance and detach the root volume, then attach it to the second cloud instance from above
   ```
   instance_a=i-XXXXXXXX # the affected instance
   instance_b=i-YYYYYYYY # the second instance
   root_device=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
     --instance-ids $instance_a \
     --output text \
     --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].RootDeviceName')
   volume=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
     --instance-ids $instance_a \
     --output text \
     --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].BlockDeviceMappings[?DeviceName==`'$root_device'`].[Ebs.VolumeId]')
   aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids $instance_a
   aws ec2 detach-volume --volume-id $volume --output text --query 'State'
   aws ec2 attach-volume  --volume-id $volume --instance-id $instance_b --device /dev/sdj
   ```
3. ssh into the second instance
4. Mount the affected volume and chroot into it
   ```
   $ sudo mount /dev/xvdj1 /mnt
   $ sudo mount /dev/xvdj15 /mnt/boot/efi
   $ for i in /sys /proc /run /dev /dev/pts; do sudo mount --bind "$i" "/mnt$i"; done
   $ sudo mv /mnt/etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf.bak # will restore later
   $ sudo cp -L /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/
   $ sudo cp /cdrom/ubuntu/pool/main/g/grub2*/*deb /mnt/tmp
   $ sudo chroot /mnt
   ```

#### Downgrade `grub2`/`grub2-signed` to the previous version for recovery

The previous version of grub2/grub2-signed will be different depending on the given Ubuntu release - these are summarised in the following table for amd64 (for other architectures, navigate to them via [https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2) and [https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2-signed](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2-signed) for your release):

| **Release** | **Previous grub2 Version** | **Previous grub2-signed Version** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 20.04 LTS | [grub2 2.04-1ubuntu26](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/2.04-1ubuntu26/%2Bbuild/19165233/%2Bfiles) | [grub2-signed 1.142.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2-signed/1.142.1/%2Bbuild/19407251/%2Bfiles) |
| 18.04 LTS | [grub2 2.02-2ubuntu8.15](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/2.02-2ubuntu8.15/%2Bbuild/18831561/%2Bfiles) | [grub2-signed 1.93.16](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2-signed/1.93.16/%2Bbuild/18831639/%2Bfiles) |
| 16.04 LTS | [grub2 2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/2.02~beta2-36ubuntu3.23/%2Bbuild/18024504/%2Bfiles) | [grub2-signed 1.66.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2-signed/1.66.23/%2Bbuild/18028097/%2Bfiles) |
| 14.04 ESM | [grub2 2.02~beta2-9ubuntu1.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/2.02~beta2-9ubuntu1.17/%2Bbuild/16522994/%2Bfiles) | [grub2-signed 1.34.20](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2-signed/1.34.20/%2Bbuild/16548803/%2Bfiles) |

Once the required versions are identified from the table above, grub2/grub2-signed can be downgraded as follows from within the chroot environment. Since the previous versions are no longer available via apt, we must download the previous versions of debs and install them with dpkg. This example uses the versions for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with typical installation packages, so these should be replaced with the appropriate versions for the given install and for packages (see 'dpkg -l | grep grub' to see what to fetch via wget). Eg:
```
# inside chroot from above (can use the links from the above table for GRUB2_LP_URL and GRUB2_SIGNED_LP_URL)
GRUB2_VERSION=2.02-2ubuntu8.15
GRUB2_LP_URL=https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/$GRUB2_VERSION/+build/18831561/+files
GRUB2_SIGNED_VERSION=1.93.16
GRUB2_SIGNED_LP_URL=https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2-signed/$GRUB2_SIGNED_VERSION/+build/18831639/+files
$ cd /tmp
# on focal, omit grub-efi and grub-efi-amd64
$ for i in grub-common grub-efi grub-efi-amd64 grub-efi-amd64-bin grub2-common ; do wget $GRUB2_LP_URL/${i}_${GRUB2_VERSION}_amd64.deb ; done
$ wget $GRUB2_SIGNED_LP_URL/grub-efi-amd64-signed_${GRUB2_SIGNED_VERSION}+${GRUB2_VERSION}_amd64.deb
$ dpkg -i ./grub*.deb
$ cp -df /etc/resolv.conf.bak /etc/resolv.conf
```

Then finally exit the chroot and unmount the root device / volume (and detach + re-attach it to the original instance for a cloud instance).

### Known issues

#### Existing Cloud / MAAS instances may fail reboot

For Cloud and MAAS images there was a cloud-init issue, [bug #1877491](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/%2Bbug/1877491), where the grub install devices were not correctly set at first boot. Existing instances that received the fix for that bug did not have the configuration fixed. There is an underlying grub issue, [bug #1889556](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/%2Bbug/1889556), where an incorrect install device causes grub-install to fail during package upgrade but the installation still proceeds, whereas it should fail the grub install. This leaves the system with grub modules on the filesystem that are newer than grub core on the boot device which causes the instance to fail to reboot, [bug #1889509](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/grub2/%2Bbug/1889509), from the mismatch.

##### Workaround

Before rebooting run sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc. A wizard will walk you through the grub configuration options. You can select the default options until you get a list of install devices. If your instance is affected by this issue you will first see a message that the install device is no longer present:

![The GRUB boot loader was previously installed to a disk that is no longer present, or whose unique identifier has changed for some reason.](/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/GRUB2SecureBootBypass?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=dpkg-reconfig_grub-pc_no-longer-present.png "The GRUB boot loader was previously installed to a disk that is no longer present, or whose unique identifier has changed for some reason.")

Proceed to the next screen and select all devices when prompted for a grub installation device.

![GRUB install devices:](/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/GRUB2SecureBootBypass?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=dpkg-reconfig_grub-pc_install-devices.png "GRUB install devices:")

At the end of the reconfiguration grub-install will update the bootloader.

```

#### Issue/Introduction

On July 29, 2020, a security vulnerability in GRUB2 identified by CVE-2020-10713 was disclosed. Exploitation of the issue allows bypassing Secure Boot on systems where Secure Boot is enabled. In order to exploit the issue, root or administrative access to the system is needed.

VMware has investigated the impact CVE-2020-10713 may have on VMware products.
### **Background**

**Secure Boot**

The aim of Secure Boot is to ensure that the entire chain of executable code from the system firmware through to the operating system is known and trusted, with each component in that chain verifying the integrity of the next.

Secure Boot uses digital signatures to ensure that only known and trusted code is executed by the system firmware before the operating system is launched.  Secure Boot is controlled by two databases: The allow list (db) contains a list of allowed digital signatures (typically in the form of X.509 certificates of signing authorities), and the deny list (dbx) contains a list of prohibited digital signatures (typically in the form of SHA-256 Authenticode hashes of specific executable images).  For code to be executed, it must be approved by db and must not be specifically prohibited by dbx.

**Scope of the Vulnerability**

Vulnerable versions of GRUB2 may be used to bypass Secure Boot protection, which breaks the chain of trust by allowing malicious software to execute before the operating system has loaded.

Exploitation of the vulnerability requires privileged access on the host or guest OS. If successful, it would allow an attacker to establish pre-OS persistence on that host or guest only.

The vulnerability does not itself enable privileged access on the host or guest OS.  Exploitation of the vulnerability in a virtual machine does not affect the host.

#### Resolution

Remediation will require that:

* Vulnerable bootloaders are replaced with updated versions, **AND**
* Hosts or virtual machines using UEFI Secure Boot receive a dbx update to ensure that the vulnerable bootloaders are no longer allowed to execute.

1. **Update vulnerable bootloaders**

A vulnerable bootloader allows an attacker with privileged access to bypass Secure Boot. Update all vulnerable GRUB2 bootloaders to a fixed version. The following table lists the VMware products with a bootloader, and Photon OS and Virtual Machines.

| **Component containing bootloader** | **Affected** | **Action Required** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VMware ESXi | No | None |
| VMware Virtual Appliances | No (1) | None |
| VMware Photon OS when configured with UEFI Secure Boot | Yes | Update Photon OS (2) |
| Virtual Machine guest OS, installation media and recovery media | Refer to OS vendor (3) (4) | Refer to OS vendor (3) (4) |

**Note (1)**: Secure Boot is not currently enabled in VMware Virtual Appliances.
**Note (2)**: The following Photon OS advisories document the grub2 update for Photon OS 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0:

* Photon OS 1.0 - [PHSA-2020-1.0-0311](https://github.com/vmware/photon/wiki/Security-Updates-1.0-311)
* Photon OS 2.0 - [PHSA-2020-2.0-0267](https://github.com/vmware/photon/wiki/Security-Updates-2-267)
* Photon OS 3.0 - [PHSA-2020-3.0-0120](https://github.com/vmware/photon/wiki/Security-Updates-3.0-120)

**Note (3)**: Customers are advised to review the guidance put out by their OS vendors for addressing the issue on their Virtual Machines. The following list provides links to the advisories by several of these OS vendors:

* Canonical: <https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4432-1>
* Debian: <https://www.debian.org/security/2020-GRUB-UEFI-SecureBoot>
* Microsoft: <https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/ADV200011>
* Red Hat: <https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/grub2bootloader>
* SUSE: <https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000019673>

**Note (4)**: Assessment should include all bootloaders, including those on OS installation media, on recovery or utility media, on network boot servers, and in existing virtual machines.

2. **Update the Secure Boot deny list**

The Secure Boot deny list (dbx) should be updated to prevent vulnerable bootloaders from being used in future.  The dbx update may be made available through an OS update or through a system firmware update.  After evaluating the risks, consider deploying this update on all hosts and guests using Secure Boot.

**IMPORTANT**: Once the dbx update is applied to a system, any vulnerable bootloaders will no longer be allowed to boot on that system.  To avoid rendering systems unbootable, ensure that each system's bootloader is updated before updating its dbx.  It might be difficult or impossible to revert a dbx update.

**IMPORTANT**: On certain hardware systems, it is possible that installing a dbx update might cause a system malfunction. Confirm suitability with the system vendor before installing a dbx update.

| **Secure Boot Implementation** | **Action Required** |
| --- | --- |
| Host running VMware ESXi and booting with UEFI Secure Boot | - Confirm dbx suitability for host - Install the dbx update on the host (1) |
| Virtual machine running on ESXi, Workstation or Fusion and configured with UEFI Secure Boot | - Confirm dbx suitability for the guest - Install the dbx update in the guest(2) |

**Note (1)**: To update dbx using a system firmware update, consult the system vendor for availability and installation guidance.

**Note (2)**: To update dbx using an OS update, consult the OS vendor for availability and installation guidance.
### **Mitigating factors**

When a host or guest has not enabled Secure Boot or is using legacy BIOS, the security boundary provided by Secure Boot does not exist and therefore this vulnerability poses no incremental risk.
When a host or guest is configured to use a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to measure its boot process, exploitation of this issue will be observable through altered TPM measurements of the boot process.

Exploitation of the vulnerability requires root or system access on the host or guest OS. This level of privilege already allows for a full compromise of the OS. The additional gain from exploiting this issue is that the attacker is capable of establishing pre-OS persistence.
### **Further Information**

**Can exploitation of this issue inside a virtual machine cause compromise of the host?**
No.

**Does the guest need to be updated before the host?  Does the host need to be updated before the guest?**
The guest and host are independent and may be updated in any order.

**Does installing an update on the host protect the guest?**
No.  Updates need to be deployed on all affected hosts and guests.

**Is the dbx update required in virtual machines (or physical machines) running a guest OS other than Linux?**
Yes.  It may still be possible for an attacker to install a vulnerable GRUB2 bootloader and use it to compromise the boot of guest OSes other than Linux.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Issue

UEFI: system hangs after POST and the grub menu never loads after applying the RHSA-2020:3216 and RHSA-2020:3217

## Resolution

Red Hat has fixed the bug in the shim packages. Updated shim packages are now available and can be used in conjunction with previously released grub2, fwupd, and fwupdate packages.

| Version | Release |
| --- | --- |
| RHEL 7.8 | [RHBA-2020:3265](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020%3A3265) |
| RHEL 8.0.0 | [RHBA-2020:3264](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020%3A3264) |
| RHEL 8.1.0 | [RHBA-2020:3263](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020%3A3263) |
| RHEL 8.2.0 | [RHBA-2020:3262](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020%3A3262) |

## Recovering the system if it's in a *dead* state due to having only applied the previous errata

1. Boot the system with the RHEL DVD in Troubleshooting mode

   Refer to [How to boot a system into rescue mode](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/770703) for details.
2. Set up the network

   Refer to [Enabling networking in rescue environment without chrooting](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2626631) for details.
3. Enter the chroot

   ```
   # chroot /mnt/sysimage

   ```
4. Apply the errata

   ```
   # yum -y update shim\*

   ```
5. Exit the *chroot* and reboot

   ```
   # exit
   # exit

   ```

## Diagnostic Steps

1. Boot the system with the RHEL DVD in Troubleshooting mode

   Refer to [How to boot a system into rescue mode](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/770703) for details.
2. Enter the chroot

   ```
   # chroot /mnt/sysimage

   ```
3. Check the version of `shim` source package

   ```
   # rpm -qa shim-\* --qf "%{SOURCERPM}\n" | sort | uniq

   ```

   On a RHEL 7 system, the packages from the following source RPMs are affected:

   ```
   shim-15-7.el7_8.src.rpm
   shim-signed-15-7.el7_8.src.rpm

   ```

   On a RHEL 8 system, the packages from the following source RPMs are affected:

   ```
   shim-15-14.el8_2.src.rpm

   ```

# CVE-2020-14310

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-14309.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-14311.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-14310 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-14310)

#### Description

There is an issue on grub2 before version 2.06 at function read\_section\_as\_string(). It expects a font name to be at max UINT32\_MAX - 1 length in bytes but it doesn't verify it before proceed with buffer allocation to read the value from the font value. An attacker may leverage that by crafting a malicious font file which has a name with UINT32\_MAX, leading to read\_section\_as\_string() to an arithmetic overflow, zero-sized allocation and further heap-based buffer overflow.

# Security Vulnerability: "Boothole" grub2 UEFI secure boot lockdown bypass

This document **(000019673)** is provided subject to the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) at the end of this document.

### Environment

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11

### Situation

Security researchers from Eclypsium have identified a flaw in grub2 that allows people to access the grub2 prompt to bypass UEFI secure boot lockdown restrictions and so boot unsigned code. This flaw is tracked by [CVE-2020-10713](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10713/) .

Further research identified more grub2 security issues that needed to be addressed similarly,
tracked by [CVE-2020-14308](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14308/), [CVE-2020-14309](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14309/), [CVE-2020-14310](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14310/) , [CVE-2020-14311](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14311/) & [CVE-2020-15706](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-15706/) .

The attack could allow running root-malware to become persistent over booting, e.g. becoming boot-malware, regardless of the operating system.
### Resolution

SUSE has released grub2 updates to address the actual security issue.

SUSE and other ecosystem vendors are also required to keep the integrity of the UEFI secure boot chain.
This in turn means that loading of older affected grub2 versions should be suppressed.

The UEFI secure boot chain will be updated in 2 stages :

* SUSE released updates for the "shim" loader that will include an exclusion for all previously released secure boot binaries, by adding our previous signing key to the exclusion list (vendor dbx)..

As this requires SUSE first rebuilding and releasing all secure boot related packages with our new signing key, this will only happen some weeks after the grub2 releases.

* Microsoft publishes a global revocation list that excludes all older "shim" versions from SUSE and other vendors from the UEFI secure boot chain.

This exclusion list is published on <https://uefi.org> and should only be applied to real systems in some months, by either BIOS vendors, Microsoft Windows Update, or manual DBX installation.
Administrators need to make sure that all BootHole related online updates have been installed before applying these DBX lists via updates.

**BACKGROUND:**

The SUSE UEFI Secure Boot Chain and actions taken:

* SUSE UEFI CA key

The existing SUSE UEFI CA key will stay as-is. This key is embedded in existing and new shim loaders and continues to be the SUSE root of secure boot trust.

* SUSE UEFI signing key

This key is signed by the SUSE UEFI CA key.
As SUSE has previously released various grub2 updates signed by the SUSE UEFI signing key, SUSE will introduce a new SUSE signing key, and block the old signing key via the new shim.

* shim

The "shim" loader is a small bootloader for UEFI based x86\_64 machines.
It is signed by the Microsoft UEFI CA, which is embedded in all UEFI BIOSes.

The shim contains the SUSE UEFI CA key which is the base of the SUSE UEFI secure boot trust chain.

SUSE updated the shim to block binaries signed by the up to now used SUSE UEFI signing key.
Microsoft will publish a UEFI DBX revocation database to revoke older versions of shims to remove ability of loading older grub2 versions.
This DBX update will be put on the uefi.org website, but not yet deployed via Windows Update or via BIOS vendor updates.

* grub2

Called by "shim", grub2 presents the boot menu and options on what to boot, then loads either the Linux Kernel or the XEN hypervisor.

SUSE released updated grub2 packages, with security fixes and signed by our new UEFI signing key.

* Linux kernel

During the evaluation of this 'grub2' security issue, some flaws were also found in the kernel that could also be used to bypass the secure boot lock down.

These are tracked in different CVE's : by [CVE-2019-20908](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-20908/) and [CVE-2020-15780](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-15780/) .
These 'lockdown' bypass security bugs affected SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SP4 and newer versions only.

SUSE has released updated kernels, with above fixed and signed by our new UEFI signing key.

* xen, kmp and other secure boot related packages

As other packages that are are in the UEFI secure boot chain will be released, these will be signed by the new UEFI signing key.
### Cause

[CVE-2020-10713](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10713/)
### Status

Security Alert
### Additional Information

As SUSE has released a new "shim", on "secure boot" enabled systems using the old versions of grub2, the kernel, or xen will no longer boot, and older SUSE provided kernel modules will no longer be loadable !

Also older DVD / ISO media provided by SUSE will no longer boot in UEFI secure boot scenarios after the UEFI DBX revocation list is applied to the machine.

SUSE provides respin media containing the newly signed shim and other packages, available via download.suse.com.

If you encounter problems, there is also the option to Disable Secure Boot temporarily via the system BIOS, install the updates, and the re-enable Secure Boot.

**Important note :**
Due to the the scale of the vulnerability spanning a wide range of components, extreme care must be taken by SUSE and other vendors to fix this issue properly.

This issue will require different stages and multiple rounds of solutions to test and confirm each solution to completely fix the problem. As a general rule, each update of each stage requires extreme care be taken because of the serious risk of bricking customer computers, should something go wrong at any of those stages...

**Update September 15, 2020 :**
As another milestone in resolving this issue for our customers, today SUSE has released the new shims required to fix the problem. The tool required to apply these shim's has not yet been released.
Along with the documentation on how to apply these shim's, SUSE will release this tool at a later stage.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

Subject: multiple secure boot grub2 and linux kernel vulnerabilities

[This message expands slightly on the post to the distros list on 2020-07-20.]

Hello All,

There are several CVEs both in GRUB2 and the Linux kernel (details
below) that compromise UEFI Secure boot and kernel lockdown.

 * These bugs allow unsigned code to be booted and run on hardware
   configured to prevent that.

 * Affected vendors will be publishing fixed, re-signed shim, grub and
   kernels to allow systems to continue to boot post-mitigation.
   Details of exactly what is published will vary from vendor to
   vendor.

 * The actual mitigation is a UEFI Revocation List update that
   prevents exploitable binaries from loading. This list will be
   available from: <https://uefi.org/revocationlistfile> soon.  Vendors
   may also include this in an updated release of a dbxtool package.

 * In addition to the Microsoft Key Encryption Key (KEK)-signed UEFI
   Revocation List updates, hardware vendors may also issue their own
   updates signed with their own KEKs.  Again, this will vary from
   vendor to vendor.

Exploiting these flaws require a significant level of access to a
system. The flaws would allow, for example, a nefarious kernel to hide
a rootkit or similar to be loaded onto a system that has UEFI Secure
Boot enabled. It is important to note that updating the exploitable
binaries does not in fact mitigate the CVE, since an attacker could
bring an old, exploitable, signed copy of a grub binary onto a system
with whatever kernel they wished to load. In order to mitigate, the
UEFI Revocation List (dbx) must be updated on a system. Once the UEFI
Revocation List is updated on a system, it will no longer boot
binaries that pre-date these fixes. This includes old install media.

Fully mitigating a system against these flaws should be done with the
clear understanding that old kernels and old install media will not
boot on a secure-boot system.

CVE details:

There are two kernel CVEs that are already public: CVE-2019-20908 and
CVE-2020-15780.  In addition there are the following GRUB2 CVEs:

CVE-2020-10713

# There's a Hole in the Boot

By:
Eclypsium

July 29, 2020

![Worm Coming out of a Boot](https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/Eclypsium-Research-Boothole.jpg)

*“BootHole” vulnerability in the GRUB2 bootloader opens up Windows and Linux devices using Secure Boot to attack. All operating systems using GRUB2 with Secure Boot must release new installers and bootloaders.*

Join Eclypsium for a recorded webinar “[Managing The Hole In Secure Boot](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17865/430345?utm_source=Eclypsium&utm_medium=brighttalk&utm_campaign=430345)“, where CEO Yuriy Bulygin and VP R&D John Loucaides explain the BootHole vulnerability and provide advice on mitigation.

## Introduction

Eclypsium researchers, Mickey Shkatov and Jesse Michael, have discovered a vulnerability — dubbed “BootHole” — in the GRUB2 bootloader utilized by most Linux systems that can be used to gain arbitrary code execution during the boot process, even when Secure Boot is enabled. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can install persistent and stealthy bootkits or malicious bootloaders that could give them near-total control over the victim device.

The vulnerability affects systems using Secure Boot, even if they are not using GRUB2. Almost all signed versions of GRUB2 are vulnerable, meaning virtually every Linux distribution is affected. In addition, GRUB2 supports other operating systems, kernels and hypervisors such as Xen. The problem also extends to any Windows device that uses Secure Boot with the standard Microsoft Third Party UEFI Certificate Authority. Thus the majority of laptops, desktops, servers and workstations are affected, as well as network appliances and other special purpose equipment used in industrial, healthcare, financial and other industries. This vulnerability makes these devices susceptible to attackers such as the [threat actors recently discovered](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1275770256389222400) using malicious UEFI bootloaders.

Eclypsium has coordinated the responsible disclosure of this vulnerability with a variety of industry entities, including OS vendors, computer manufacturers, and CERTs. Mitigation will require new bootloaders to be signed and deployed, and vulnerable bootloaders should be revoked to prevent adversaries from using older, vulnerable versions in an attack. This will likely be a long process and take considerable time for organizations to complete patching.

## Background: Secure Boot, GRUB2, and CAs

Secure Boot can be a fairly deep and technical topic. Our goal here is to give a high-level introduction to the key concepts relevant to this research without going into all the granular details. We have included a variety of external links to provide additional information for those interested. Alternatively, you can go straight to the [description of the vulnerability](#breaking) itself.

### Threats to the Boot Process

The boot process is one of the most fundamentally important aspects of security for any device. It relies on a variety of firmware that controls how a device’s various components and peripherals are initialized and ultimately coordinates the loading of the operating system itself. In general, the earlier code is loaded, the more privileged it is.

If this process is compromised, attackers can control how the operating system is loaded and subvert all higher-layer security controls. Recent research has identified ransomware in the wild using [malicious EFI bootloaders](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1275770256389222400) as a way to take control of machines at the time of boot. Previously threat actors used malware tampering with legacy OS bootloaders including  [APT41 Rockboot](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0112/), [LockBit](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/04/24/lockbit-ransomware-borrows-tricks-to-keep-up-with-revil-and-maze/), [FIN1 Nemesis](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/nemesis-malware-hijacks-pcs-boot-process-to-gain-stealth-persistence/), [MBR-ONI](https://www.cybereason.com/blog/night-of-the-devil-ransomware-or-wiper-a-look-into-targeted-attacks-in-japan), [Petya/NotPetya](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-181A), and [Rovnix](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.rovnix).

Additional information on threats to the modern PC boot process is available in the “[Bootkits and UEFI Secure Boot](https://github.com/abazhaniuk/firmware-security-training/blob/master/BIOS-UEFI-Security.2-BootkitsSecureBoot.pdf)” section of the System Firmware training.

### UEFI Secure Boot

UEFI Secure Boot was originally developed by the UEFI Forum as a way to protect the boot process from these types of attacks. There are other implementations of secure boot designed for different environments, but UEFI Secure Boot is the standard for PCs and servers. The goal is to prevent malicious code from being introduced into the boot process by cryptographically checking each piece of firmware and software before it is run. Any code not recognized as valid is not executed in the boot process.

Secure Boot uses cryptographic signatures to verify the integrity of each piece of code as it is needed during the boot process. There are two critical databases involved in this process: the Allow DB (db) of approved components and the Disallow DB (dbx) of vulnerable or malicious components, including firmware, drivers, and bootloaders. Access to modify these databases is protected by a Key Exchange Key (KEK), which in turn is verified by a Platform Key (PK). Although the PK is used as a root of trust for updates to the platform, it’s not expressly part of the boot process (but is shown below for reference). It is dbx, db, and KEK that are used to verify the signatures for loaded executables at boot time.

![](https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/bh_diagram_1.png)

Additional details on the Secure Boot process can be found in this [PDF](http://www.c7zero.info/stuff/Windows8SecureBoot_Bulygin-Furtak-Bazhniuk_BHUSA2013.pdf).

### Chains of Trust and GRUB2

Next, OEMs must manage a list of who is permitted to sign code trusted by the Secure Boot Database. Instead of having every OEM manage certificates from every possible firmware, driver, or OS provider, Secure Boot allows for the use of a centralized Certificate Authority (CA). Microsoft’s 3rd Party UEFI CA provides the industry standard signing service for Secure Boot. In short, third parties can submit their code to Microsoft, and Microsoft will validate and sign the code with the Microsoft CA. This establishes a chain of trust that only requires OEMs to enroll the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA to their platforms to enable them to boot third-party installation media and operating systems by default when Secure Boot is enabled.

This includes the ability to sign bootloaders from non-Microsoft operating systems such as Linux. In almost every modern Linux distribution, GRUB (the Grand Unified Bootloader) is the bootloader that loads and transfers control to the operating system. In this document, all references to GRUB are intended to refer to GRUB2, which was a complete rewrite from the previous version commonly referred to as “GRUB Legacy.” Starting in 2009, all widely used Linux distributions have transitioned to using GRUB2. GRUB Legacy has been deprecated and is generally only found in older releases.

[Due to legal issues arising from license incompatibilities](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/hardware-dev-center/updated-uefi-signing-requirements/ba-p/1062916), open-source projects and other third parties build a small application called a “shim,” which contains the vendor’s certificate and code that verifies and runs the bootloader (GRUB2). The vendor’s shim is verified using the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA and then the shim loads and verifies the GRUB2 bootloader using the vendor certificate embedded inside itself.

![](https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/bh_diagram_2.png)

Additional detail on the role of the Microsoft UEFI CA in the boot process is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-secure-boot-key-creation-and-management-guidance).

### Challenges of Secure Boot

As with any technical process, Secure Boot is not without its potential problems. The process involves many pieces of code, and a vulnerability in any one of them presents a single point of failure that could allow an attacker to bypass Secure Boot. Additionally, although UEFI Secure Boot attempts to provide certain integrity guarantees to the boot process, other misconfigurations of the hardware or missing protection features can undermine boot security. One such example is a [DMA attack](https://eclypsium.com/research/direct-memory-access-attacks-a-walk-down-memory-lane/) using tools such as [PCIe Microblaze](https://github.com/Cr4sh/s6_pcie_microblaze). Additionally, as we will show in this blog post, a vulnerability in the boot process that enables arbitrary code execution can allow attackers to control the boot process and operating system, even when secure boot signatures are verified.

Attackers can also use a vulnerable bootloader against the system. For example, if a valid bootloader was found to have a vulnerability, a piece of malware could replace the device’s existing bootloader with the vulnerable version. The bootloader would be allowed by Secure Boot and give the malware complete control over the system and OS. Mitigating this requires very active management of the dbx database used to identify malicious or vulnerable code.

![](https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/diagram_3_newr-1024x247-2.png)

Additionally, updates and fixes to the Secure Boot process can be particularly complex and run the risk of inadvertently [breaking machines](https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-pulls-uefi-related-windows-update-after-users-report-problems). The boot process naturally involves a variety of players and components including device OEMs, operating system vendors, and administrators. Given the fundamental nature of the boot process, any sort of problems run a high risk of rendering a device unusable. As a result, updates to Secure Boot are typically slow and require extensive industry testing.

## Breaking Secure Boot Through GRUB2

In the course of Eclypsium’s analysis, we have identified a buffer overflow vulnerability in the way that GRUB2 parses content from the GRUB2 config file (grub.cfg). Of note: The GRUB2 config file is a text file and typically is not signed like other files and executables. This vulnerability enables arbitrary code execution within GRUB2 and thus control over the booting of the operating system. As a result, an attacker could modify the contents of the GRUB2 configuration file to ensure that attack code is run before the operating system is loaded. In this way, attackers gain persistence on the device.

Such an attack would require an attacker to have elevated privileges. However, it would provide the attacker with a powerful additional escalation of privilege and persistence on the device, even with Secure Boot enabled and properly performing signature verification on all loaded executables. One of the explicit design goals of Secure Boot is to prevent unauthorized code, even running with administrator privileges, from gaining additional privileges and pre-OS persistence by disabling Secure Boot or otherwise modifying the boot chain.

With the sole exception of one bootable tool vendor who added custom code to perform a signature verification of the grub.cfg config file in addition to the signature verification performed on the GRUB2 executable, all versions of GRUB2 that load commands from an external grub.cfg configuration file are vulnerable. As such, this will require the release of new installers and bootloaders for all versions of Linux. Vendors will need to release new versions of their bootloader shims to be signed by the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA. It is important to note that until all affected versions are added to the dbx revocation list, an attacker would be able to use a vulnerable version of shim and GRUB2 to attack the system. This means that every device that trusts the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA will be vulnerable for that period of time.

In addition to vendors using shims signed by the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA, some OEMs that control both the hardware and the software stack in their devices use their own key that is provisioned into the hardware at the factory to sign GRUB2 directly. They will need to provide updates and revocation of previous vulnerable versions of GRUB2 for these systems as well.

This vulnerability was assigned CVE-2020-10713 “GRUB2: crafted grub.cfg file can lead to arbitrary code execution during boot process” with a CVSS rating of 8.2 (High) / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.

Follow these links to go directly to the [Impact](#impacts) and [Mitigations](#mitigation) sections.

### Vulnerability Analysis

The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that occurs in GRUB2 when parsing the grub.cfg file. This configuration file is an external file commonly located in the EFI System Partition and can therefore be modified by an attacker with administrator privileges without altering the integrity of the signed vendor shim and GRUB2 bootloader executables. The buffer overflow allows the attacker to gain arbitrary code execution within the UEFI execution environment, which could be used to run malware, alter the boot process, directly patch the OS kernel, or execute any number of other malicious actions.

To dig a little deeper into the vulnerability itself, we’ll take a closer look at how the code works internally. In order to process commands from the external configuration file, GRUB2 uses flex and bison to generate a parsing engine for a domain-specific language (DSL) from language description files and helper functions.

This is generally considered to be a better approach than manually writing a custom parser for each DSL. However, GRUB2, flex, and bison are all complex software packages with their own design assumptions that can be easy to overlook. And those mismatched design assumptions can result in vulnerable code.

The parser engine generated by flex includes this define as part of the token processing code:

```
#define YY_DO_BEFORE_ACTION \
    yyg->yytext_ptr = yy_bp; \
    yyleng = (int) (yy_cp - yy_bp); \
    yyg->yy_hold_char = *yy_cp; \
    *yy_cp = '\0'; \
    if ( yyleng >= YYLMAX ) \
        YY_FATAL_ERROR( "token too large, exceeds YYLMAX" ); \
    yy_flex_strncpy( yytext, yyg->yytext_ptr, yyleng + 1 , yyscanner); \
    yyg->yy_c_buf_p = yy_cp;

```

In this macro, the generated code detects that it has encountered a token that is too large to fit into flex’s internal parse buffer and calls `YY_FATAL_ERROR()`, which is a helper function provided by the software that is using the flex-generated parser.

However, the `YY_FATAL_ERROR()` implementation provided in the GRUB2 software package is:

```
#define YY_FATAL_ERROR(msg)                     \
  do {                                          \
    grub_printf (_("fatal error: %s\n"), _(msg));     \
  } while (0)

```

Rather than halting execution or exiting, it just prints an error to the console and returns to the calling function. Unfortunately, the flex code has been written with the expectation that any calls to `YY_FATAL_ERROR()` will never return. This results in `yy_flex_strncpy()` being called and copying the source string from the configuration file into a buffer that is too small to contain it.

![](https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/bh_diagram_4-1024x696-1.png)

Beyond just this specific path, a number of additional places throughout the flex-generated code also expect that any calls to `YY_FATAL_ERROR()` never return and perform unsafe operations when that expectation is broken. Mismatched assumptions between producers and consumers of an API are a very common source of vulnerabilities.

Ultimately, by providing a configuration file with input tokens that are too long to be handled by the parser, this buffer overflow overwrites critical structures in the heap. These overwritten fields include internal parser structure elements, which can be used as an arbitrary write-what-where primitive to gain arbitrary code execution and hijack the boot process.

![](https://eclypsium.com/wp-content/uploads/bh_diagram_5-1024x891-1.png)

Of further note, the UEFI execution environment does not have Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) or Data Execution Prevention (DEP/NX) or other exploit mitigation technologies typically found in modern operating systems, so creating exploits for this kind of vulnerability is significantly easier. The heap is fully executable without the need to build ROP chains.

Finally, rather than being architecture-specific, this vulnerability is in a common code path and was also confirmed using a signed ARM64 version of GRUB2.

### Additional Vulnerabilities

There have been a couple of examples of previous vulnerabilities found in GRUB2 that result in arbitrary code execution, but with a much smaller scope.

In April 2019, a vulnerability in how GRUB2 was used by the Kaspersky Rescue Disk was [publicly disclosed](https://habr.com/en/post/446238/). In February 2020, more than six months after a fixed version had been released, Microsoft pushed an update to revoke the vulnerable bootloader across all Windows systems by updating the UEFI revocation list (dbx) to block the known-vulnerable Kaspersky bootloader. Unfortunately, this resulted in systems from multiple vendors encountering unexpected errors, including bricked devices, and the [update was removed from the update servers](https://www.windowslatest.com/2020/02/15/windows-10-kb4524244-issues/).

Additionally, in May 2020, Dmytro Oleksiuk [disclosed](https://twitter.com/d_olex/status/1264238411679887360) that certain HPE ProLiant servers contained a version of GRUB2 signed by a HP CA that allows the use of the “insmod” command to load unsigned code. This issue was assigned CVE-2020-7205 and is also embargoed until July 29th.

In response to our initial vulnerability report, additional scrutiny was applied to the GRUB2 code and a number of additional vulnerabilities were discovered by the Canonical security team:

* **CVE-2020-14308 GRUB2:** grub\_malloc does not validate allocation size allowing for arithmetic overflow and subsequent heap-based buffer overflow
  + 6.4 (Medium) / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
* **CVE-2020-14309 GRUB2:** Integer overflow in grub\_squash\_read\_symlink may lead to heap based overflow
  + 5.7 (Medium) / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
* **CVE-2020-14310 GRUB2:** Integer overflow read\_section\_from\_string may lead to heap based overflow
  + 5.7 (Medium) / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
* **CVE-2020-14311 GRUB2:** Integer overflow in grub\_ext2\_read\_link leads to heap based buffer overflow,
  + 5.7 (Medium) / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
* **CVE-2020-15705 GRUB2:** avoid loading unsigned kernels when grub is booted directly under secure boot without shim
  + 6.4 (Medium) /CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
* **CVE-2020-15706 GRUB2 script:** Avoid a use-after-free when redefining a function during execution
  + 6.4 (Medium) /CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
* **CVE-2020-15707 GRUB2:** Integer overflow in initrd size handling.
  + 5.7 (Medium) /CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

Given the difficulty of this kind of ecosystem-wide update/revocation, there is a strong desire to avoid having to do it again six months later. To that end, a large effort — spanning multiple security teams at Oracle, Red Hat, Canonical, VMware, and Debian — using static analysis tools and manual review helped identify and fix dozens of further vulnerabilities and dangerous operations throughout the codebase that do not yet have individual CVEs assigned.

### Impact

Due to a weakness in the way GRUB2 parses its configuration file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code that bypasses signature verification. The Boot Hole vulnerability discovered by Eclypsium can be used to install persistent and stealthy bootkits or malicious bootloaders that operate even when Secure Boot is enabled and functioning correctly. This can ensure attacker code runs before the operating system and can allow the attacker to control how the operating system is loaded, directly patch the operating system, or even direct the bootloader to alternate OS images. It gives the attacker virtually unlimited control over the victim device. Malicious bootloaders have recently been [observed in the wild](https://twitter.com/ESETresearch/status/1275770256389222400), and this vulnerability would make devices susceptible to these types of threats.

All signed versions of GRUB2 that read commands from an external grub.cfg file are vulnerable, affecting every Linux distribution. To date, more than 80 shims are known to be affected. In addition to Linux systems, any system that uses Secure Boot with the standard Microsoft UEFI CA is vulnerable to this issue. As a result, we believe that the majority of modern systems in use today, including servers and workstations, laptops and desktops, and a large number of Linux-based OT and IoT systems, are potentially affected by these vulnerabilities.

Additionally, any hardware root of trust mechanisms that rely on UEFI Secure Boot could be bypassed as well.

## Mitigation

Full mitigation of this issue will require coordinated efforts from a variety of entities: affected open-source projects, Microsoft, and the owners of affected systems, among others. This will include:

1. Updates to GRUB2 to address the vulnerability.
2. Linux distributions and other vendors using GRUB2 will need to update their installers, bootloaders, and shims.
3. New shims will need to be signed by the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA.
4. Administrators of affected devices will need to update installed versions of operating systems in the field as well as installer images, including disaster recovery media.
5. Eventually the [UEFI revocation list (dbx)](https://uefi.org/revocationlistfile) needs to be updated in the firmware of each affected system to prevent running this vulnerable code during boot.

On the Coordinated Release Date (CRD) of July 29, we expect to see advisories and/or updates from the following affected parties:

* Microsoft
* UEFI Security Response Team (USRT)
* Oracle
* Red Hat (Fedora and RHEL)
* Canonical (Ubuntu)
* SuSE (SLES and openSUSE)
* Debian
* Citrix
* VMware
* Various OEMs
* Software vendors, including security software, are also impacted by this vulnerability and will be updating their bootloaders.
* … more to be added once we have a full list …

However, full deployment of this revocation process will likely be very slow. UEFI-related updates have had a [history of making devices unusable](https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-pulls-uefi-related-windows-update-after-users-report-problems), and vendors will need to be very cautious. If the revocation list (dbx) is updated before a given Linux bootloader and shim are updated, then the operating system will not load. As a result, updates to the revocation list will take place over time to prevent breaking systems that have yet to be updated. There are also edge cases where updating the dbx can be difficult, such as with dual-boot or deprovisioned machines. When any OS is installed or launched, the bootloader and OS need to be updated before the revocation is applied to the system.

Further complicating matters, enterprise disaster recovery processes can run into issues where approved recovery media no longer boots on a system if dbx updates have been applied. In addition when a device swap is needed due to failing hardware, new systems of the same model may have already had dbx updates applied and will fail when attempting to boot previously-installed operating systems. Before dbx updates are pushed out to enterprise fleet systems, recovery and installation media must be updated and verified as well.

Microsoft will be releasing a set of signed dbx updates, which can be applied to systems to block shims that can be used to load the vulnerable versions of GRUB2. Due to the risk of bricking systems or otherwise breaking operational or recovery workflows, these dbx updates will initially be made available for interested parties to manually apply to their systems rather than pushing the revocation entries and applying them automatically. This will allow IT professionals, enthusiasts, and others the opportunity to test the revocation updates on their individual systems and identify any issues before making the revocations mandatory.

Organizations should additionally ensure they have appropriate capabilities for monitoring UEFI bootloaders and firmware and verifying UEFI configurations, including revocation lists, in their systems. Organizations should also test recovery capabilities as updates become available, including the “reset to factory defaults” functionality in the UEFI setup. This will ensure that they can recover devices if a device is negatively impacted by an update. Finally, organizations should be monitoring their systems for threats and ransomware that use vulnerable bootloaders to infect or damage systems.

### Recommendations

1. Right away, start monitoring the contents of the bootloader partition (EFI system partition). This will buy time for the rest of the process and help identify affected systems in your environment. For those who have deployed the Eclypsium solution, you can see this monitoring under the “MBR/Bootloader” component of a device.
2. Continue to install OS updates as usual across desktops, laptops, servers, and appliances. Attackers can leverage privilege escalation flaws in the OS and applications to take advantage of this vulnerability so preventing them from gaining administrative level access to your systems is critical. Systems are still vulnerable after this, but it is a necessary first step. Once the revocation update is installed later, the old bootloader should stop working. This includes rescue disks, installers, enterprise gold images, virtual machines, or other bootable media.
3. Test the revocation list update. Be sure to specifically test the same firmware versions and models that are used in the field. It may help to update to the latest firmware first in order to reduce the number of test cases.
4. To close this vulnerability, you need to deploy the revocation update. Make sure that all bootable media has received OS updates first, roll it out slowly to only a small number of devices at a time, and incorporate lessons learned from testing as part of this process.
5. Engage with your third-party vendors to validate they are aware of, and are addressing, this issue. They should provide you a response as to its applicability to the services/solutions they provide you as well as their plans for remediation of this high rated vulnerability.

Eclypsium has [powershell and bash scripts available](https://github.com/eclypsium/BootHole/) which can be used to detect bootloaders that are being revoked by this dbxupdate.

## Conclusions

While Secure Boot is easily taken for granted by most users, it is the foundation of security within most devices. Once compromised, attackers can gain virtually complete control over the device, its operating system, and its applications and data. And as this research shows, when problems are found in the boot process, they can have far-reaching effects across many types of devices.

We will update this blog post as more information becomes available, and we encourage users and administrators to closely monitor alerts and notifications from their hardware vendors, the [Microsoft MSRC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc), and any relevant open-source projects.

### **July 30 Important Update**

Some of the Linux distribution updates appear to be leading to unsuccessful reboots. The developers and distribution maintainers are working to provide new updates. The maintainers are recommending to avoid installing updates for grub2, shim, and other bootloader-related applications until new packages are available. Some of the issues to watch are listed below:

# CVE-2020-10713

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-10711.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-10717.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-10713 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10713)

#### Description

A flaw was found in grub2, prior to version 2.06. An attacker may use the GRUB 2 flaw to hijack and tamper the GRUB verification process. This flaw also allows the bypass of Secure Boot protections. In order to load an untrusted or modified kernel, an attacker would first need to establish access to the system such as gaining physical access, obtain the ability to alter a pxe-boot network, or have remote access to a networked system with root access. With this access, an attacker could then craft a string to cause a buffer overflow by injecting a malicious payload that leads to arbitrary code execution within GRUB. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

An attacker may use the GRUB 2 flaw to hijack and tamper the GRUB verification process. This flaw also allows the bypass of Secure Boot protections. In order to load an untrusted or modified kernel, an attacker would first need to establish access to the system such as gaining physical access, obtain the ability to alter a pxe-boot network, or have remote access to a networked system with root access. With this access, an attacker could then craft a string to cause a buffer overflow by injecting a malicious payload that leads to arbitrary code execution within GRUB. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2020-07-29 19:27:41 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1825243#c0)  Marco Benatto    2020-04-17 13:21:03 UTC  ``` On grub2 up to version 2.04, it's possible to inject code and subvert the boot process via a specially crafted grub configuration file. When grubx64.efi loads the malicious configuration file, the contents of a grub_parser_param structure are overwritten with string contents from the crafted input leading to arbitrary code execution. The boot process can be subverted even with secure boot enabled.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1825243#c2)  Marco Benatto    2020-04-20 20:30:25 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Jesse Michael (Eclypsium), Mickey Shkatov (Eclypsium)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1825243#c14)  Marco Benatto    2020-07-27 14:10:03 UTC  ``` There's an issue with grub2 package. The grub2 is configured via grub.cfg configuration file, this file itself is composed by several key/values entries and it's parsed when grub2 is loaded. When parsing file grub copies the values into an internal buffer with a predetermined size, however when detecting the string length is bigger than the max buffer size grub2 doesn't abort the execution which may lead to a heap based buffer overflow. An attacker may leverage this flaw but crafting a malicious grub.cfg file (either local or via sftp for netboot) leading to a possible arbitrary code execution during boot stage and possibly by-passing the Secure Boot mechanism if enabled.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1825243#c30)  Eric Christensen    2020-07-29 14:54:18 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  There is no mitigation for the flaw.   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=1825243#c32)  Marco Benatto    2020-07-29 15:39:44 UTC  ``` Statement:  Kernel and kernel-rt packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 are being updated to contain the new Red Hat certificate for secure boot.   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1825243#c33)  Marco Benatto    2020-07-29 18:14:15 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.eclypsium.com/2020/07/29/theres-a-hole-in-the-boot/> <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/07/29/3> <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2020-07/msg00034.html>   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=1825243#c34)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-07-29 18:30:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:3216 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3216](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A3216)   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=1825243#c35)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-07-29 19:27:41 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

```
We are aware of the Boot Hole vulnerability in grub2 (CVE-2020-1073) and
are working on releasing new packages for CentOS Linux 7, CentOS Linux 8
and CentOS Stream in response. These should make it out to a mirror near
you shortly.

/!\ Secureboot Systems - Please do a full update /!\

CentOS Linux 8 and CentOS Stream systems with secureboot enabled MUST
update the kernel, grub2, and shim packages together. As part of this
CVE, we have re-issued the kernel and shim signing certificate
authorities, and previously released EL8 kernels cannot boot in
secureboot mode with the newer shim/grub2.

The following packages boot together in secureboot mode on CentOS Stream:

  *

    kernel-4.18.0-227.el8 / kernel-rt-4.18.0-227.rt7.39.el8

  *

    grub2-2.02-87.el8_2

  *

    shim-x64-15-13.el8

The following packages boot together in secureboot mode on CentOS Linux 8:

  *

    kernel-4.18.0-193.14.2.el8_2

  *

    grub2-2.02-87.el8_2

  *

    shim-x64-15-13.el8

For systems with CentOS Linux 7 or with secureboot disabled, we strongly
recommend doing a full `dnf/yum update` to pick up all of the latest
patches at the same time.

On behalf of the CentOS Team,

## GRUB2 bootloader is vulnerable to buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#174059

Original Release Date: 2020-07-29 | Last Revised: 2020-08-13

---

### Overview

The GRUB2 boot loader is vulnerable to buffer overflow, which results in arbitrary code execution during the boot process, even when Secure Boot is enabled.

### Description

[GRUB2](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/) is a multiboot boot loader that replaced GRUB Legacy in [2012](https://www.archlinux.org/news/grub-legacy-no-longer-supported/). A boot loader is the first program that runs upon boot and loads the operating system. Many vendors also use a shim, a signed software package that contains the vendorâs certificate and code that verifies and runs the boot loader. This means that firmware Certificate Authority providers can just sign the shim as opposed to all of the other supported programs.

GRUB2 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when parsing content from the GRUB2 configuration file (grub.cfg). This configuration file is an external file commonly located in the EFI System Partition and can therefore be modified by an attacker with administrator privileges without altering the integrity of the signed vendor shim and GRUB2 boot loader executables. This could allow an authenticated, local attacker to modify the contents of the GRUB2 configuration file to ensure that the attacker's chosen code is run before the operating system is loaded. This could allow the attacker to gain persistence on the device, even with Secure Boot enabled. All versions of GRUB2 that load commands from an external grub.cfg configuration file are vulnerable.

### Impact

An authenticated, local attacker could modify the contents of the GRUB2 configuration file to execute arbitrary code that bypasses signature verification. This could allow the attacker to gain persistence on the device, even with Secure Boot enabled. Because the attacker's code runs before the operating system, the attacker could control how the operating system is loaded, directly patch the operating system, or even direct the bootloader to alternate OS images. All versions of GRUB2 that load commands from an external grub.cfg configuration file are vulnerable.

### Solution

**Apply an update if operationally feasible**

Update GRUB2 to the latest version to address this vulnerability when operationally feasible. Some [patches](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5272311) were originally reported to leave systems unbootable so users are encouraged to review and test patches prior to implementing them. Linux distributions and other vendors using GRUB2 will need to update their installers, boot loaders, and shims. New shims will need to be signed by the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI Certificate Authority. Administrators of affected devices will need to update installed versions of operating systems as well as installer images, including disaster recovery media. Until all affected versions are added to the dbx revocation list, an attacker would be able to use a vulnerable version of shim and GRUB2. Eventually the UEFI revocation list (dbx) needs to be updated in the firmware of each affected system to prevent running this vulnerable code during boot.
