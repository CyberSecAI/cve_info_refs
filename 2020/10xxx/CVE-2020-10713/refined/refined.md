Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10713:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content contains various sources describing the "BootHole" vulnerability in GRUB2 and how it relates to CVE-2020-10713. This confirms the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   *   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability in GRUB2's configuration file parser. Specifically, the `YY_FATAL_ERROR()` implementation does not halt execution but continues parsing, and when a configuration token is larger than the internal buffer, `yy_flex_strncpy()` copies the token into a buffer that is too small. This leads to a heap-based buffer overflow. Additionally, integer overflow issues were identified as part of the analysis, and are detailed in CVE-2020-14308, CVE-2020-14309, CVE-2020-14310, CVE-2020-14311 and CVE-2020-15707. Also mentioned is an issue when grub is booted directly under secureboot without shim (CVE-2020-15705) as well as a use-after-free vulnerability in grub2 (CVE-2020-15706)

   *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
      *   Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking in the GRUB2 config file parser.
      *   Arithmetic overflow in grub\_malloc, leading to invalid memory allocation and heap-based buffer overflow.
      * Integer overflows in grub\_squash\_read\_symlink, read\_section\_from\_string and grub\_ext2\_read\_link leading to heap based buffer overflows
      *   Failure to validate kernel signatures when grub is booted without shim
     * Use-after-free vulnerability
    * Integer overflow in initrd size handling

   *   **Impact of Exploitation:**
        *   Arbitrary code execution within the GRUB2 environment.
        *   Bypass of UEFI Secure Boot protections.
        *   Possibility of injecting malware into the boot process (bootkits or malicious bootloaders).
        *   Control over the OS loading process, direct patching of the OS kernel, or ability to direct the bootloader to alternate OS images
         *  Potential compromise of data confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.

   *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Local access to the system (physical or through remote root access).
        *   Ability to modify the GRUB2 configuration file (grub.cfg), either by gaining access to the EFI system partition or by altering a PXE-boot configuration.
        * By crafting a malicious font file.

   *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        *   The attacker needs administrative or root privileges, or physical access to the targeted system.
        *   Ability to modify boot configuration.
        * Network access or physical access to the system is required to carry out the attack.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects most Linux distributions and any Windows devices that utilize Secure Boot with the standard Microsoft Third Party UEFI CA.
*   The vulnerability is not specific to a particular architecture and has been confirmed using signed ARM64 version of GRUB2.
*   The documents also mention the need for a multi-stage mitigation process including fixes to GRUB2, updates to shims signed by the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA and eventually an updated UEFI Revocation List (dbx).
* The information indicates a coordinated effort by vendors to address the issue.
*  Some documents mention potential issues and failed boot attempts after applying the initial updates.
* Some documents note that older kernel versions for RHEL 7 will be added automatically on the shimâ€™s allow list, whereas older RHEL 8 kernels will require manual enrollment of their hashes

**4. Content Provides More Detail Than Official CVE Description:**

Yes, the content provides significantly more technical detail than a typical CVE description, including the root cause (buffer overflow, flex/bison interaction) and the method of exploitation. It also describes the steps needed to mitigate the problem.

**5. Summary of Findings**

The content is highly relevant to CVE-2020-10713, providing a comprehensive overview of the BootHole vulnerability in GRUB2, encompassing the technical details, impact, and necessary steps for remediation, including additional CVEs related to the same attack vector.
