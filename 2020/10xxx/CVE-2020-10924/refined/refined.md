- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists within the UPnP service due to the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length, stack-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow, insufficient input validation
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute code in the context of root on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can bypass authentication and exploit the UPnP service which listens on TCP port 5000 by default.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the target device and needs to bypass the existing authentication mechanism.
