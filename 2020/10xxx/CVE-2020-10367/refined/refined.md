Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-10367:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way wireless chips (like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) coordinate spectrum access to avoid collisions. This coordination, often implemented through hardware-level serial interfaces, creates a new attack vector called "Spectra".
*   Specifically, the issue lies in the inter-chip communication, where vendor-specific extensions in the co-existence mechanisms can be exploited. An attacker with code execution on one chip (e.g., Bluetooth) can escalate privileges to another (e.g., Wi-Fi).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardware-Level Flaws:** The vulnerabilities exist at the hardware level within the wireless chips, making them difficult to patch via software updates alone. The coordination mechanisms and their vendor-specific implementations are the core weakness.
*   **Inter-Chip Escalation:** The primary weakness is that an attacker can leverage co-existence mechanisms to escalate code execution from a compromised Bluetooth chip to a Wi-Fi chip.
*  **Lateral Movement:** An attacker can perform a lateral denial of service attack by obtaining code execution on the Bluetooth or Wi-Fi chip, impacting shared memory resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** An attacker with code execution on a Bluetooth chip can gain code execution on the Wi-Fi chip.
*   **Denial of Service:** A lateral denial-of-service attack is possible, impacting the availability of shared resources.
*   **Information Leakage:** One wireless core can potentially gain information about the activities of another core through the co-existence mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wireless Attacks:** The attack vector involves exploiting the co-existence mechanisms between wireless chips, specifically Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
*   **Code Execution on Bluetooth Chip:** An attacker needs to first gain code execution on the Bluetooth chip.
*   **Inter-Chip Communication Exploitation:**  The vulnerability is exploited through the serial interface that the chips use to coordinate spectrum access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Execution on Bluetooth Chip:** An attacker must achieve code execution on the Bluetooth chip as a starting point. This could be through a variety of attack vectors targeting Bluetooth itself.
*   **Proximity:** The attacker would likely need to be in wireless range of the vulnerable device to exploit Bluetooth initially.
*   **Understanding of Co-existence Mechanisms:** Exploiting the vulnerability requires a deep understanding of the hardware-level co-existence mechanisms and inter-chip communication protocols.

**Additional Details:**

*   The "Spectra" attack is not specific to certain devices but affects many devices with combination wireless chips from vendors like Broadcom and Cypress. This includes iPhones, MacBooks, Samsung Galaxy series, and Raspberry Pis, among others.
*   The vulnerability was initially addressed by OS updates which aimed to prevent an attacker from exploiting the Bluetooth RAM. However, the researchers noted that these patches do not address the underlying hardware vulnerabilities.
*   The attack can achieve three primary actions: denial of service, information leakage, and code execution on the other wireless core.
*   The vulnerability is considered severe because it allows an attacker to cross the separation between wireless chips that are typically isolated from each other.
