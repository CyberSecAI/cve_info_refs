- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the use of `DocumentBuilderFactory` without disabling external entity processing, allowing for XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `XmlValidatorManager.java` and `XmlUserManager.java` files use `DocumentBuilderFactory` which is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection by default.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially read local files, perform denial-of-service attacks, or potentially achieve remote code execution by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious XML file with an external entity, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability during the XML parsing process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to submit a malicious XML file to the vulnerable application.
