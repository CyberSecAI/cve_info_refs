The provided content describes multiple post-authentication XSS vulnerabilities in Nagios XI version 5.6.11.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in multiple parameters before including it in the HTML response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable pages.
- This could allow an attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect the user to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerabilities are triggered by sending crafted HTTP requests to specific Nagios XI endpoints with malicious payloads in the following parameters:
  - `/ldap_ad_integration/`: `username` and `password` parameters.
  - `/account/main.php`: `theme` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
