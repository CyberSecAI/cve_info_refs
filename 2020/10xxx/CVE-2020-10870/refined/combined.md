## Description

![@mssalvatore](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19957806?u=ab617379f51ef77736da7dc9f449b721be47a94e&v=4&size=48)[mssalvatore](https://github.com/mssalvatore)opened [on Mar 6, 2020](https://github.com/zim-desktop-wiki/zim-desktop-wiki/issues/1028#issue-577207106)

**Description**

Zim creates temporary directories with predictable names. A malicious user could predict and create Zim's temporary directories and prevent other users from being able to start Zim, resulting in a denial of service.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Create two users: user1 and user2.
2. As user1:

   `mkdir /tmp/zim-user2`
3. As user2:

   Start Zim

Zim will attempt to change the permissions of /tmp/user2 to 0700. Because /tmp/user2 is actually owned by user1, the call to `os.chmod()` will fail and Zim will crash.

**Workaround**

An affected user can set the $TMP or $TMPDIR environment variables to point to somewhere that is not world-writable (e.g. `/home/USER/tmp`).

**Version Affected**

0.42-beta1 and later

**Operating System**

Linux

**Severity**

Low
