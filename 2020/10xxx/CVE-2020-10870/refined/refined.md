{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Zim creates temporary directories in /tmp with predictable names based on the user. A malicious user can create these directories before Zim does, preventing Zim from starting.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Predictable temporary directory names",
    "Lack of proper handling when the temporary directory already exists with incorrect permissions."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service. If a malicious user creates the temporary directory with incorrect permissions, Zim will fail to start for the intended user.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious user creates the predictable temporary directory before the target user runs Zim.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to create directories in `/tmp` and needs to know the target user's username. The attacker must also create the directory before the target user attempts to run Zim."
