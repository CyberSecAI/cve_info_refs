Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-10124:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of encryption, authentication, and integrity verification of messages transmitted between the Bunch Note Acceptor (BNA) and the host computer within NCR SelfServ ATMs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Message Protection:** Communications between the BNA and the host computer are not encrypted, authenticated, or verified for integrity.
- **Unprotected Communication Bus:** The communication bus between the BNA and host computer is vulnerable to physical attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Deposit Forgery:** An attacker can manipulate messages sent from the BNA to the host computer to inflate the amount of currency deposited. This can then be used to withdraw an amount of money not actually deposited.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution** While not directly tied to this CVE, a related vulnerability detailed in CVE-2020-10126 could enable arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the internal components of the ATM, including the BNA and the host computer.
- **Manipulation of Communication Bus:** The attacker intercepts and manipulates messages on the communication bus between the BNA and the host computer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the ATM's internal components.
- **Technical Skills:**  The attacker needs the skills to intercept and manipulate data on the ATM's communication bus.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-9062, which affects the cash and check deposit module (CCDM) in ATMs from another vendor.
- The provided document also details two related vulnerabilities, CVE-2020-10125 and CVE-2020-10126, in the same context.
- The affected ATM models run APTRA XFS 04.02.01 and 05.01.00.
- The vendor recommends upgrading to APTRA XFS 06.08 to address the vulnerabilities
