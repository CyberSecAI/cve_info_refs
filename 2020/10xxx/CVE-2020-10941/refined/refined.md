Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-10941:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Cache timing side-channel attack during RSA key import. Specifically, by observing the cache usage during the RSA private key import, sensitive information such as the private key itself can be leaked.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Side-channel vulnerability due to cache timing.
-  The vulnerability exists in how the RSA key is imported.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain the RSA private key by analyzing the cache usage during the import process.
- The leaked private key can be used to decrypt communications or forge signatures.

**Attack vectors:**
- Cache timing analysis.
- The attack vector involves observing the memory cache behavior.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to monitor the cache usage patterns during the RSA key import process.
- The vulnerability was specifically noted to affect Intel SGX, indicating the attacker would need to be in a position to perform this type of monitoring, potentially within the same SGX enclave or with access to sufficient low-level system information.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in mbed TLS versions 2.21.0, 2.16.5, and 2.7.14.
- Fedora 31 and 32 were affected by this vulnerability and received updates to version 2.16.7 which addressed this vulnerability.
- Debian 10 was also affected and received an update to 2.16.9-0~deb10u1 to resolve the issue.
