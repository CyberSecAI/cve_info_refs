The provided content relates to CVE-2020-10563.

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The commit message "sous-version 3.4.1c : mise à jour de sécurité" and the CHANGELOG entry "[correction] failles de sécurité dans formulaire de contact et gestion des ressources" indicate that the security update addresses vulnerabilities in the contact form and resource management components.
- The code diffs show sanitization being added via `protect_data_sql()` in `frmcontactlist.php` and `frmcontactrange.php`, which suggests the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- The `admin/admin_edit_room.php` diff reveals changes related to file uploads, including checks for allowed extensions, MIME type validation, and image recreation. These changes suggest that there may be a vulnerability related to file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in `frmcontactlist.php` and `frmcontactrange.php` allowed for potential SQL injection attacks.
- **File Upload Vulnerabilities:** Issues in `admin/admin_edit_room.php`  allowed for the upload of malicious files with disallowed extensions or MIME types. There was also a vulnerability with double extensions which allowed files to bypass the initial checks. The code was also vulnerable to corrupted or crafted image files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database or manipulate the data, potentially leading to data breaches or the compromise of the system's integrity.
- **File Upload Vulnerabilities:** A malicious actor could upload files containing malware, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server, or could be used for defacement, cross site scripting, or denial of service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** By crafting malicious SQL queries through the `id` parameter in `frmcontactlist.php` and `frmcontactrange.php`.
- **File Upload Vulnerabilities:** By uploading malicious files through the `doc_file` parameter in `admin/admin_edit_room.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to interact with the web application.
- For SQL injection, the attacker would need to identify a vulnerable parameter to exploit.
- For file upload vulnerabilities, the attacker needs to access the admin panel.
