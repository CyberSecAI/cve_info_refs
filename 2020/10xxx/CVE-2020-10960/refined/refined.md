Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `jquery.makeCollapsible` function in MediaWiki allows applying event handlers to any CSS selector provided by user-controlled content. This function was not escaping user-provided CSS selectors, leading to unintended behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unescaped CSS Selectors:** The core vulnerability lies in the fact that the `jquery.makeCollapsible` function directly used CSS selectors from user input without proper escaping. This allowed users to inject arbitrary CSS selectors, such as `*` which targets all elements on the page.
*   **Event Handler Injection:** The injected CSS selectors were used to apply event handlers which control the collapsing/expanding behavior, which when applied to all elements with the `*` selector can modify intended functionality of the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **UI Manipulation:** By injecting a CSS selector like `*`, an attacker could apply collapsing/expanding event handlers to all elements on the page, disrupting the user interface.
*   **Denial of Service (potentially):** Although not explicitly stated, applying these event handlers to all elements could render a page unusable, leading to a form of denial-of-service.
*   **Interference with Admin Actions:** There was concern that such manipulation could interfere with admin actions like reverting edits or deleting the page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Controlled Content:** The attack vector was the ability for users to add or modify content (wikitext) that would use the `mw-collapsible` class with the malicious CSS selector.
*   **Specifically crafted wikitext:** The attacker injects the malicious CSS selector through the `mw-collapsible` tag by using the id attribute. Example: `<span class="mw-collapsible" id="mw-customcollapsible-*,body">a</span>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Account:** An attacker would require a user account with the ability to edit wiki pages.
*   **Wikitext Knowledge:** The attacker would need to know how to use the `mw-collapsible` class and insert the malicious CSS selector in the correct format.
*   **Configuration Dependency:** The vulnerability is more easily exploited when  `$wgFragmentMode` is set to `[ 'html5', 'legacy' ]` or `[ 'html5' ]`. The default configuration of `[ 'legacy', 'html5' ]` would prevent the issue

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was considered a security concern due to the potential for interface disruption and interference with administrative tasks, although it was not considered likely to result in XSS.
*   The fix involved escaping the user-generated CSS selectors using `$.escapeSelector` in the `jquery.makeCollapsible` function.
* The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2020-10960.
*   The fix was applied to MediaWiki versions 1.31.7, 1.33.3, and 1.34.1.
