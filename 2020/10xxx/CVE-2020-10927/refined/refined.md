- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the use of an inappropriate cryptographic algorithm for encrypting firmware update images on NETGEAR R6700 routers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected NETGEAR R6700 router.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely, without authentication. This vulnerability can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router, and does not need any authentication credentials.
