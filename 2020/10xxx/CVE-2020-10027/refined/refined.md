{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ARC architecture's syscall validation used a signed comparison (`blt`) instead of an unsigned comparison (`blo`). This allowed a malicious user-space application to pass a negative value for the syscall number, bypassing the check and potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect use of signed comparison in syscall validation",
      "Potential for privilege escalation"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious user-space application could elevate its privileges to that of the kernel by bypassing the syscall number validation, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the kernel.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious user-space application",
      "Bypassing syscall number validation"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have code execution capabilities within a user-space thread and needs to be able to craft a negative syscall number."
