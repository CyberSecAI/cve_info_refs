{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of file uploads, allowing execution of uploaded PHP files due to misconfiguration or lack of proper file type validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Lack of file type validation/blacklisting",
      "Insecure webserver configuration"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution (RCE)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Uploading malicious PHP files to the server"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to upload files to the application."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "Implementation of a configurable blacklist for uploaded filenames, blocking file types like `.php`, `.php3`, `.phar`, `.phpt`, `.pht`, `.phtml`, `.pgif`.",
     "Additional security measure against path traversal attacks (although not reproducible in their tests)."
  ],
   "details": "The vulnerability can be exploited if the webserver is not configured to only execute `app.php` in the web root, which allows execution of any uploaded php file. The built-in PHP webserver is always vulnerable, and it should never be used in production. The fix includes a configurable blacklist of file extensions that cannot be uploaded, and a block for path traversal attacks."
