Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10695:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure modifications made to the `/etc/passwd` file within the `redhat-sso-7` container. Specifically, the file permissions are changed to allow modification by users other than root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the incorrect setting of permissions on the `/etc/passwd` file, making it writable by non-root users within the container.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with access to the running container can modify the `/etc/passwd` file. This allows them to add a new user with elevated privileges (e.g., root) or modify existing user entries, leading to privilege escalation within the container.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Container Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the running `redhat-sso-7` container. This could be achieved through various means, such as exploiting another vulnerability to gain access to the container or having legitimate access that is later misused.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Container:** The attacker must have some level of access to a running instance of the vulnerable `redhat-sso-7` container.
*   **Ability to Write to /etc/passwd:** The attacker must be able to leverage the insecure file permissions to modify the `/etc/passwd` file.

**Additional details:**

*   The bug report indicates the vulnerability was found in multiple containers, but this specific CVE is related to the `openshift/redhat-sso-7` container.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `redhat-sso 7.4.4`.
*   Red Hat Security Advisories `RHSA-2020:5529` and `RHSA-2020:5533` address this issue in RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers and Red Hat Single Sign-On, respectively.
