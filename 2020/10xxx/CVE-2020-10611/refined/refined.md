Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-10611:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling data set elements in the Triangle MicroWorks SCADA Data Gateway. This leads to a type confusion condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Type Confusion (CWE-843):** The software does not properly validate the type of user-supplied data, leading to a situation where the software misinterprets the data, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system in the context of SYSTEM.
*   **High Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating high impact across confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **DNP3 Data Sets:** This vulnerability is specifically applicable to installations using DNP3 Data Sets within the SCADA Data Gateway.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability, meaning that an attacker can attempt exploitation without needing valid credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the affected SCADA Data Gateway.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The required skill level to exploit the vulnerability is considered low, implying the exploit is relatively straightforward.
*   **No Credentials Needed:** The attacker does not require prior authentication or credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Triangle MicroWorks SCADA Data Gateway software versions 2.41.0213 through 4.0.122.
*   Triangle Microworks has released an update (version 4.0.123) to correct this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to CISA by the Incite Team of Steven Seeley and Chris Anastasio, and Tobias Scharnowski, Niklas Breitfeld, and Ali Abbasi working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative.
