- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Critical services for the operation of the KUKA robot controller can be terminated using the Windows Task Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the ability to terminate critical services via the Windows Task Manager, a standard tool on the underlying operating system.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Terminating these critical services brings the manipulator to a halt, requiring a re-calibration of the brakes. This recalibration can only be performed by a KUKA technician or with specialized KUKA hardware, leading to delays and increased operational costs.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the Windows Task Manager accessible on the KUKA controller's operating system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the Windows Task Manager on the KUKA robot controller's system. This is described as "physical access" within the provided CVSS vector.
