  "cveId": "CVE-2020-10577",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in Janus through 0.9.1. janus.c has multiple concurrent threads that misuse the source property of a session, leading to a race condition when claiming sessions.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "Multiple concurrent threads misuse the `source` property of a session.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race condition due to concurrent access of the `source` property without proper locking."
    ],
    "impact": "A race condition occurs when claiming sessions.",

    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "None",
    "additionalDetails": [
      "The `source` property is used to relate a session to a transport instance.",
      "The code for 'claim' properly locks the `source` property, but the code that notifies the event doesn't, leading to a race.",
      "The fix ensures all instances where the `source` property is accessed are locked.",
      "The 'claim' functionality now does nothing if the session is already owned by the same transport instance."
