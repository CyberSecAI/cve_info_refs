    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In the provided exploit, the attacker dumps the database name and device credentials.",

      "description": "The provided python script exploits the SQL injection vulnerability in the /compliancepolicyelements.inc.php endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `searchColumn` parameter. It first extracts the database name and then dumps the `nodes` table containing sensitive device information like IP, username, password and enable password. It chains a union SQL query to extract data from the database",
