- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to a non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Non-persistent XSS vulnerability (CWE-79). The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by other users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to an attacker initiating a password change on the affected device. This could lead to unauthorized access and control of the device. The attacker needs to trick the target into accessing a specially crafted URL and submit credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL sent by the attacker to the victim. The victim is required to provide credentials through the manipulated URL to the gateway before the attack can be successful.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a legitimate user into accessing it and entering credentials. The attacker needs to have a high skill level and has to know the structure of the URLs used by the eWON devices. The attacker can be remote since the vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
