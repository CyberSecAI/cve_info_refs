Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-10023:

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-10023 identifies a buffer overflow vulnerability within the `shell_spaces_trim` function of the Zephyr OS shell subsystem. This flaw allows an attacker with physical access to the device to potentially cause memory corruption, leading to a denial of service or, in the worst case, arbitrary code execution within the Zephyr kernel.

**Root Cause:**
* The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the `shell_spaces_trim` function handles strings with trailing spaces when using `memmove`. The third argument in `memmove` which specifies the number of bytes to copy, can be greater than the remaining buffer size, which leads to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Buffer Overflow:**  The primary weakness is a buffer overflow in the `shell_spaces_trim` function.
* **Insufficient Bounds Checking:** The code does not properly validate the calculated size argument to `memmove`, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

* **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause a device crash due to memory corruption.
* **Code Execution:** In the worst case, the attacker might be able to overwrite critical memory areas leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

* **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the device with a serial or telnet connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

* **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical access to the device.
* **Shell Access:** The attacker needs access to the Zephyr shell (via serial or telnet) to trigger the vulnerability.
* **Input Manipulation:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input string containing a specific sequence of spaces at the end of a long string to trigger the buffer overflow condition in `shell_spaces_trim`.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by a long string that ends with two spaces followed by a non-space character.
*   The issue was fixed in Zephyr versions v1.14.2, v2.2.0, and v2.1.1.
