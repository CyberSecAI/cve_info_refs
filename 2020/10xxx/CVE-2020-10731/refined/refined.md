Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-10731:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `nova_libvirt` container in Red Hat OpenStack Platform 16 was shipped with SELinux disabled.
*   The `libvirtd` daemon, which manages virtual machines, runs inside this container.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Disabled SELinux:**  The primary weakness is the lack of SELinux enforcement within the `nova_libvirt` container.
*   **Missing sVirt Protection:** Disabling SELinux also disables sVirt, which is a security feature that provides isolation between virtual machines.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Loss of VM Isolation:**  Without sVirt, virtual machines running on the affected OpenStack platform lack a crucial isolation mechanism. This means that a compromised VM could potentially affect other VMs on the same host or gain access to the underlying host system.
*   **Increased Attack Surface:** The lack of isolation increases the attack surface, making it easier for malicious actors to compromise VMs or the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A successful attack would likely involve first compromising a virtual machine running on the affected OpenStack platform.
*   Once inside a VM, the attacker could leverage the lack of isolation provided by sVirt to potentially gain access to other VMs or the host system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to have the ability to compromise a virtual machine.
*   The vulnerable system would need to be running Red Hat OpenStack Platform 16 with the affected `nova_libvirt` container.

**Additional Information:**

*   The issue affects Red Hat OpenStack Platform 16.
*   Fixes for this vulnerability have been released in the following versions of openstack-tripleo-heat-templates: 11.3.2 and 10.6.3
*   Red Hat has released security advisories (RHSA-2020:3199, RHSA-2020:3406, and RHSA-2020:3410) to address this issue in different versions of Red Hat OpenStack Platform 16.1, 16.0, and 15.0 respectively.
