*   The attack vector is **network-based** (AV:N).
*   The attack requires **no user interaction** (UI:N).
*   Exploitation requires **low skill** (low complexity AC:L).
*   The attacker does not require any **privileges** (PR:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
*   No special privileges or user interaction is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
