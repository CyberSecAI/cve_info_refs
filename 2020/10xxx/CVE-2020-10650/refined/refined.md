Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-10650:

**1. Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the way FasterXML jackson-databind handles polymorphic type handling, specifically when used with untrusted input, allowing for unsafe deserialization. This can occur if an attacker can control the type of class being deserialized and that class is a "gadget class", that is, it allows execution of malicious code or access to sensitive information.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Unsafe deserialization
    *   Ability to instantiate and modify objects via setters and field assignments
    *   Inclusion of "gadget" classes in the Java classpath
    *   Enabling polymorphic type handling for `java.lang.Object` or similar types
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   Disclosure of sensitive information.
    *   Addition or modification of data.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS).
*  **Attack Vectors**:
    *   Network-based attacks are possible through crafted JSON payloads.
*  **Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   An attacker needs to be able to supply malicious JSON to a vulnerable endpoint.
    *   The attacker needs to have access to vulnerable NetApp Products.
    *   No special privileges or user interaction are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**2. Affected Software:**

*   The vulnerability is present in FasterXML jackson-databind versions prior to 2.9.10.4.
*   Multiple NetApp products that incorporate this library are affected, including:
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for Linux
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere

**3. Remediation:**

*   **Patches:** NetApp has provided patches for the affected products, which include an updated version of the jackson-databind library.
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for Linux: Versions 9.9, 9.10, 9.11, 9.12, and 9.13.
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows: Versions 9.9, 9.10, 9.11, 9.12, and 9.13.
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere: Versions 9.9, 9.10, 9.11, 9.12, and 9.13.
*   **Workarounds:**  There are no workarounds currently available, and users are urged to apply the fixes.
*   **Obtaining Fixes:** Patches are available via the NetApp Support website or through technical support.

**4. Technical Details (from GitHub):**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Jackson databind version 2.9.10.4 with commit `a424c038ba0c0d65e579e22001dec925902ac0ef`.
*   This fix includes blocking a new "gadget type" called `ignite-jta` by adding these classes to a list of blocked classes that cannot be deserialized using polymorphic type handling:
    *   `org.apache.ignite.cache.jta.jndi.CacheJndiTmLookup`
    *   `org.apache.ignite.cache.jta.jndi.CacheJndiTmFactory`
    *   `org.quartz.utils.JNDIConnectionProvider`
* The fix blocks unsafe deserialization by adding the following classes to the `DEFAULT_NO_DESER_CLASS_NAMES` set in `SubTypeValidator.java`

**5. Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability was initially reported by Srikanth Ramu (threedr3am)
*   A blog post by "cowtowncoder" (FasterXML/jackson-databind maintainer) provides in-depth information about Jackson CVEs, including details on polymorphic type handling and how to mitigate this class of vulnerabilities
*   A Debian LTS advisory (DLA-3407-1) also addresses this vulnerability in jackson-databind

**6. CVSS Vector**

*   The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.
    *   **AV:N** (Attack Vector: Network) - The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
    *   **AC:H** (Attack Complexity: High) - The attack requires specialized conditions to exist or be crafted by an attacker.
    *   **PR:N** (Privileges Required: None) - No privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **UI:N** (User Interaction: None) - No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   **S:U** (Scope: Unchanged) - An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority.
    *   **C:H** (Confidentiality: High) - There is a high impact on the confidentiality of data.
    *   **I:H** (Integrity: High) - There is a high impact on the integrity of data.
    *   **A:H** (Availability: High) - There is a high impact on the availability of the system.
*  The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.1 (High).

**Summary of Key Points**

CVE-2020-10650 is a high-severity vulnerability in FasterXML jackson-databind that affects NetApp products. The root cause is unsafe deserialization due to the library's polymorphic type handling, which can be exploited by an attacker to cause information disclosure, data modification, or denial of service. The primary attack vector is through a network using crafted JSON payloads. The recommended fix is to upgrade to the patched versions of affected products. NetApp has provided patches for the products affected and advises customers to update their systems.
