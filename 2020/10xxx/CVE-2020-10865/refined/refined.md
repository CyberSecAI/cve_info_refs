Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-10865:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `aswTask` RPC endpoint of the `TaskEx` library in the Avast Service (`AvastSvc.exe`). This endpoint allows for interaction with the service via Remote Procedure Calls (RPC).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary File Modification:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to make arbitrary changes to the "Components" section of the `Stats.ini` file. This file likely contains configuration data for Avast components.
*   **Unrestricted Access:** The vulnerability is triggered by RPC calls from a Low Integrity process, meaning that a low-privileged process can leverage this flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can modify the `Stats.ini` file, potentially leading to:
    *   **Tampering with Avast's functionality:** By changing component configurations, the attacker might be able to disable or interfere with Avast's protection mechanisms.
    *   **Persistant changes:** Modifications to the `Stats.ini` file may persist even after reboots, leading to a persistent compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **RPC Calls:** The attack vector involves sending malicious RPC requests to the vulnerable `aswTask` endpoint.
*   **Low Integrity Process:** The attack can be performed by a low-integrity process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the target system within a low-integrity process.

**Additional Information**

* The content provides more detail than the official CVE description. The github content describes the root cause (aswTask RPC endpoint), the attack vector (RPC calls from low integrity process) and the impact of exploitation (arbitrary changes to Stats.ini).
* The affected versions are Avast Antivirus before version 20.
