The provided content is related to CVE-2020-10193.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the parsing engine of ESET products, specifically in how it handles RAR archive format. By manipulating the RAR archive's Compression Information field, an attacker can create an archive that bypasses the AV engine. This manipulated archive will appear clean to the AV software, while still being accessible to the end-user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core vulnerability is an archive parsing bypass in the ESET engine when it encounters a malformed RAR archive.
- The AV engine fails to correctly scan manipulated RAR archives, leading to a 'clean' rating despite potentially containing malicious content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious files can be delivered and executed without detection by ESET security products.
- Gateway products, such as email or HTTP proxies, may allow the malicious archive to pass through unscanned.
- Server-side AV software will not detect code/samples inside the manipulated archive, enabling attackers to hide implants or exfiltration servers.

**Attack vectors:**
- Creation of a specially crafted RAR archive with manipulated Compression Information field.
- Delivery via standard attack vectors, such as email, web downloads, or other file transfer methods, to an end user or system protected by ESET.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted RAR archive.
- Ability to deliver the malicious archive to a target environment that is using a vulnerable version of ESET product
