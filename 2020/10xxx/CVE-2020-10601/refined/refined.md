The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in VISAM Automation Base (VBASE), and CVE-2020-10601 is one of them.

**CVE-2020-10601 Details:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate encryption strength due to a weak hashing algorithm.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Weak hashing algorithm and insecure file permissions may allow an attacker to bypass password protection.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can bypass the password-protected mechanism through brute-force attacks, cracking techniques, or overwriting the password hash, potentially gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Attack vectors:** Local access.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the system, with low privilege.

The document provides more detail than the official CVE description, by specifying the weak hashing algorithm and insecure permissions as contributing factors.
