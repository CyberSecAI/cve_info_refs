Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10791:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the "Test Connection" feature within the Grafana Module of openITCOCKPIT. This feature allows users to test the connection to a Grafana server, which could be exploited to perform a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The "Test Connection" feature, without proper access control, can be used to make requests to internal or external resources from the openITCOCKPIT server, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized access to internal systems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially use the vulnerable "Test Connection" feature to:
    - Scan internal networks
    - Access internal services that are not exposed to the internet
    - Potentially obtain sensitive information by interacting with internal or external services that the server has access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of openITCOCKPIT, by using the "Test Connection" function in the Grafana Module.
- The attacker needs to have access to openITCOCKPIT to be able to use the "Test Connection" feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account on the openITCOCKPIT instance.
- The attacker needs to have permission to access the Grafana module.
- The attacker needs to be able to navigate the openITCOCKPIT web interface.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability is resolved by introducing a user role permission named `testGrafanaConnection`. This permission can be used to restrict the access to the "Test Connection" feature. The provided commit shows the changes to the access control lists to achieve this.

**Additional notes:**
The blog post includes the following information:
- CVE-2020-10791 is rated as a medium severity vulnerability.
- The provided commit changes are related to restricting access to the "Test Connection" feature using a user permission.
- The blog post mentions that updating openITCOCKPIT to version 3.7.3 resolves this vulnerability along with other critical vulnerabilities.
