Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-10206:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The VNC server running on the Amino Aria 7 set-top box uses a hard-coded password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hard-coded password:** The VNC server utilizes the password `envnc123`.
- **Lack of access control:** Although the VNC service is not exposed on the external interface, it can be accessed once the attacker has SSH access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access:** An attacker with SSH access to the device can gain remote access to the device's user interface by connecting to the VNC server using the hard-coded password.
- **Information disclosure:** The attacker can view the user interface as it is displayed on the connected TV, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must first gain SSH access to the device. This could be achieved through other vulnerabilities, like the hardcoded SSH keys, or command injection vulnerabilities, as described in the article.
- Once SSH access is achieved, the attacker connects to the VNC server using the hardcoded password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to connect to the STB's SSH service (e.g., through a vulnerability like the hardcoded SSH keys).
- The attacker must know the hardcoded password.
