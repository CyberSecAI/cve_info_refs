  "CVE-2020-10761": {
    "description": "An assertion failure issue was found in the Network Block Device(NBD) Server in all QEMU versions before QEMU 5.0.1. This flaw occurs when an nbd-client sends a spec-compliant request that is near the boundary of maximum permitted request length. A remote nbd-client could use this flaw to crash the qemu-nbd server resulting in a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "An assertion failure in the Network Block Device (NBD) server within QEMU. This was triggered when a client sent a request close to the maximum permitted length.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Assertion failure",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) of the qemu-nbd server by crashing it.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network Block Device (NBD) server",
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker with the ability to send crafted NBD requests to a vulnerable QEMU server.",
    "notes": "The SUSE information indicates the issue is resolved, with fixes in later versions of qemu. It also provides CVSS v2 and v3 scores, and lists affected and fixed package versions. The openwall.com content indicates this flaw was introduced in QEMU v4.2 and a fix was available."
