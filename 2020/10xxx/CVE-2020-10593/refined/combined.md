# Resolve TROVE-2020-004

This is a remotely triggerable memory leak on relays and clients, found by tobias pulls.

The issue is that when circpad\_setup\_machine\_on\_circ() is reached with an inconsistent internal configuration, it fails to free an object that is replaced. It logs a bug warning, but that isn't enough.

Tobias Pulls found that this code was actually reachable, though, and results in a memory leak.

To upload designs, you'll need to enable LFS and have an admin enable hashed storage. [More information](/help/user/project/issues/design_management.md#prerequisites)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-10593 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10593)

| [Description](#c0)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2020-03-18 16:22:17 UTC  ``` from tor-packagers: >Hello! >New tor releases are tagged and signed, and available at ><https://dist.torproject.org/> .  Please remember to check the >signatures.  >Here are the changelog links:  >0.3.5.10: <https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/ChangeLog?h=tor-0.3.5.10> >0.4.1.9: <https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/ChangeLog?h=tor-0.4.1.9> >0.4.2.7: <https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/ChangeLog?h=tor-0.4.2.7> >0.4.3.3-alpha: <https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/ChangeLog?h=tor-0.4.3.3-alpha>  >Note that these releases fix several vulnerabilities, including a >remotely triggerable CPU DoS.  Everybody running older versions should >upgrade to one of these.  For TROVE and CVE identifiers and more about >the vulnerabilities, please see the ChangeLogs.  --- Further miscellaneous details: >  This is the third stable release in the 0.4.2.x series. It backports >  numerous fixes from later releases, including a fix for TROVE-2020- >  002, a major denial-of-service vulnerability that affected all >  released Tor instances since 0.2.1.5-alpha. Using this vulnerability, >  an attacker could cause Tor instances to consume a huge amount of CPU, >  disrupting their operations for several seconds or minutes. This >  attack could be launched by anybody against a relay, or by a directory >  cache against any client that had connected to it. The attacker could >  launch this attack as much as they wanted, thereby disrupting service >  or creating patterns that could aid in traffic analysis. This issue >  was found by OSS-Fuzz, and is also tracked as CVE-2020-10592.  ---  1) CVE-2020-10592  Description from ChangeLog: o Major bugfixes (security, denial-of-service, backport from 0.4.3.3-alpha):     - Fix a denial-of-service bug that could be used by anyone to       consume a bunch of CPU on any Tor relay or authority, or by       directories to consume a bunch of CPU on clients or hidden       services. Because of the potential for CPU consumption to       introduce observable timing patterns, we are treating this as a       high-severity security issue. Fixes [bug 33119](show_bug.cgi?id=33119 "RESOLVED FIXED - /usr/bin/tar: sys-apps/star conflicts with sys-apps/tar"); bugfix on       0.2.1.5-alpha. Found by OSS-Fuzz. We are also tracking this issue       as TROVE-2020-002 and CVE-2020-10592.  2) CVE-2020-10593  Description from ChangeLog:   o Major bugfixes (circuit padding, memory leak, backport from 0.4.3.3-alpha):     - Avoid a remotely triggered memory leak in the case that a circuit       padding machine is somehow negotiated twice on the same circuit.       Fixes [bug 33619](show_bug.cgi?id=33619 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - /lib/rcscripts being repeatedly corrupted"); bugfix on 0.4.0.1-alpha. Found by Tobias Pulls.       This is also tracked as TROVE-2020-004 and CVE-2020-10593. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2020-03-18 16:55:49 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=13955a3f9dd43e0146b3abf1533dab545f1754e3>  commit 13955a3f9dd43e0146b3abf1533dab545f1754e3 Author:     Sam James (sam_c) <sam@cmpct.info> AuthorDate: 2020-03-18 16:50:23 +0000 Commit:     Anthony G.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1167013#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2020-03-18 17:39:30 UTC  ``` <https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2020-March/000196.html>    o Major bugfixes (security, denial-of-service, backport from 0.4.3.3-alpha):     - Fix a denial-of-service bug that could be used by anyone to       consume a bunch of CPU on any Tor relay or authority, or by       directories to consume a bunch of CPU on clients or hidden       services. Because of the potential for CPU consumption to       introduce observable timing patterns, we are treating this as a       high-severity security issue. Fixes [bug 33119](show_bug.cgi?id=33119 "RESOLVED FIXED"); bugfix on       0.2.1.5-alpha. Found by OSS-Fuzz. We are also tracking this issue       as TROVE-2020-002 and CVE-2020-10592.  Fixed in 0.3.5.10, 0.4.1.9, and 0.4.2.7. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1167013#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-03-20 20:30:05 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1167013) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/786984> 15.2 / tor ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1167013#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-03-24 05:40:09 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1167013) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/787624> 15.1 / tor ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1167013#c3)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2020-03-24 21:03:27 UTC  ``` <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/786716> updated Factory / tor  so all maintained openSUSE versions now got the update ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1167013#c4)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-03-29 22:15:31 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:0406-1: An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
