Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10063:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow when parsing a CoAP packet, specifically during option parsing. This occurs because the code does not properly validate the length of CoAP options, potentially leading to an overflow when calculating memory offsets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow: The code fails to validate the length of CoAP options properly before using it in calculations. Specifically the addition of option length and offset may cause overflow.
- Lack of proper input validation: The CoAP parsing logic does not sufficiently check the size of incoming data, leading to out-of-bounds reads/writes due to an integer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote denial of service: An attacker can send a crafted CoAP packet that triggers the overflow, causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted CoAP packets: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious CoAP packets with specific option lengths designed to trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send CoAP packets to the vulnerable device.
- No special privileges needed on the target system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is in the CoAP parsing logic within the Zephyr RTOS.
- The fix involves adding checks to prevent integer overflows when parsing CoAP options.
- Patches have been applied to various branches of Zephyr (v1.14, v2.1, v2.2, and main/master), and is present in v2.3.
- The vulnerability was identified by NCC Group.
- The affected code involves parsing the CoAP option length, which is a u16 value.
