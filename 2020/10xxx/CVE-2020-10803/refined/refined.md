  "CVE-2020-10803": {
    "description": "In phpMyAdmin 4.x before 4.9.5 and 5.x before 5.0.2, a SQL injection vulnerability was discovered where malicious code could be used to trigger an XSS attack through retrieving and displaying results (in tbl_get_field.php and libraries/classes/Display/Results.php). The attacker must be able to insert crafted data into certain database tables, which when retrieved (for instance, through the Browse tab) can trigger the XSS attack.",
    "root_cause": "SQL injection vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization when displaying retrieved data from database tables.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser by injecting malicious SQL code into database tables, which is then rendered by phpMyAdmin without proper sanitization.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack requires the attacker to have the ability to insert specially crafted data into database tables, and relies on a user then accessing and displaying this data (e.g., via the Browse tab).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to insert data into the database that phpMyAdmin manages.",
     "details": "The vulnerability is present in `tbl_get_field.php` and `libraries/classes/Display/Results.php`. The injected SQL is not sanitized during display which triggers an XSS when a user views the crafted data. This was introduced since phpMyAdmin 3.4."
