Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10935:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Zulip processes links within markdown content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows for the injection of malicious scripts via specially crafted markdown links.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of the vulnerability would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement of the user interface
    *   Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker would need to craft a malicious markdown link and insert it into a Zulip message or other area that processes markdown.
*   When a user interacts with the crafted link (e.g., viewing the message containing it), the malicious script would be executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to post or otherwise inject markdown into the Zulip system. This likely means they need an account on the Zulip server and the ability to send messages or edit content that is processed by the markdown engine.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Zulip versions prior to 2.1.3.
*   Zulip 2.1.3 includes a fix for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Luis Ariel Sadovsky and Pablo Zurro of Core Security.
