# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @lminiero **[lminiero](/lminiero)** commented [Mar 11, 2020](#issue-579178153) • edited Loading

Ref: [CVE-2020-10574](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r7hq-qm3m-7mxv "CVE-2020-10574")

We've been notified about a typo in the JSON validation of the "query\_logger" Admin API request, that could lead to trying to use a string that doesn't actually exist. This was quite clearly a copy paste error, when duplicating the existing "query\_handler" to support loggers as well, and this patch fixes it for good.

I verified this fixes the issue for me, and so I'm planning to merge (very) soon, but feedback is welcome.

Sorry, something went wrong.
