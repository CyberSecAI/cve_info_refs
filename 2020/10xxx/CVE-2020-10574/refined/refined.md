Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-10574

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a typo within the JSON validation process of the "query_logger" Admin API request in Janus. Specifically, the code attempts to use a string that does not exist due to a copy/paste error during the duplication of the "query_handler" functionality to support loggers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Typo in JSON validation:** A copy-paste error in the code caused a discrepancy in the expected string, leading to the attempt to use a non-existent string during the "query_logger" Admin API request. This indicates an improper input validation.
- **Incorrect string usage:** The code attempts to use a string that does not exist. This could potentially lead to a crash, memory issues, or other undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a potential denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the program attempting to access non-existent memory/data, leading to crashes or unpredictable behavior.
- The vulnerability has a "Critical" severity rating with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating a high potential for exploitation and impact.
- The confidentiality, integrity, and availability are all rated as "High" under CVSS v3 metrics.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, making it easily reachable by attackers.
- **Admin API:** The attack targets the "query_logger" Admin API request, which suggests an attacker would need access to the Janus Admin API to trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Janus Admin API.
- No specific user interaction or privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability, making it easier to exploit.
- The attack complexity is low.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was fixed with a pull request ([meetecho/janus-gateway#1989](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway/pull/1989)) which was merged on Mar 11, 2020.
- The vulnerability is present in Janus versions through 0.9.1.
- The fix involved correcting the typo in the `querylogger_parameters`.
-  The vulnerability is related to CWE-706 (Use of Incorrectly-Typed Variable)
