- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation may allow for remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs low skill level to exploit the vulnerability, and network access to the affected system. The vulnerability is exploitable with low privileges (PR:L).
