Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Missing functional level access control:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper privilege checks on a feature within Red Hat CloudForms. This means that even users with low privileges could access certain functionalities that should be restricted.
*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** The system uses direct object references without proper authorization, allowing an attacker to access data by manipulating these references.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Functional Level Access Control Bypass:**  A user with low privileges is able to access the EVM-Admin API due to missing privilege checks.
*   **IDOR:**  The system directly exposes internal objects (like sensitive data) through insecure references, allowing an attacker to potentially access other resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Leakage:** An attacker could potentially access and leak sensitive data that should be restricted to higher privileged roles within CloudForms.
*   **Compromise:** The vulnerability could lead to a broader compromise of the system, since access to EVM-Admin API is gained without proper authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **EVM-Admin API:** The attacker exploits the EVM-Admin API due to missing privilege checks.
*   **Manipulation of direct object references:** If an attacker knows the right criteria they can manipulate object references to access sensitive data they shouldn't have access to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privilege User:** The attacker needs only low-level access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of the right criteria:** The attacker must have some understanding of how the system uses object references or other required criteria to exploit it.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Red Hat CloudForms versions 4.7 and 5.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in cfme-gemset version 5.11.7.1.
*   RHSA-2020:3358 addresses this issue.
