Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10375:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the storage of user passwords in an easily reversible, obfuscated format within the `data.mdb` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Password Storage:** Instead of using proper hashing techniques with salt, the application employed a simple obfuscation method, making it trivial to recover the original passwords. This is a violation of secure coding practices for sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credentials Exposure:** An attacker with local access to the system could easily extract and recover user passwords from the `data.mdb` file. This would lead to a complete compromise of user accounts.
- **Confidentiality and Integrity Loss:** The exposure of user credentials could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive medical office and patient data, which are managed by the software.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to the system where the `data.mdb` file resides. This means the attacker needs to be on the same machine or have file system access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to access the file system where the `data.mdb` file is stored. This could be achieved through physical access, compromised user accounts, or exploiting other vulnerabilities allowing file access.
- No specific privileges beyond the ability to read the file are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
