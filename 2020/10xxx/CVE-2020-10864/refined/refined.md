Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10864:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `aswTask` RPC endpoint within the `TaskEx` library of the Avast Service (`AvastSvc.exe`). This endpoint allows execution of specific tasks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted Access:** The `aswTask` RPC endpoint does not properly restrict access based on the calling process's integrity level. This allows a low-integrity process to invoke privileged functions.
- **Insecure Task Execution:** The `TaskEx` library, which is used by the RPC endpoint, provides access to a reboot function without proper authentication or authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Reboot:** An attacker can force a system reboot by sending a crafted RPC request to the vulnerable endpoint. This can lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **RPC Exploitation:** The attack is carried out by sending a specifically crafted RPC call to the vulnerable `aswTask` endpoint of the Avast Service (`AvastSvc.exe`).
- **Low Integrity Process:** The attacker can initiate the attack from a low-integrity process, implying that the vulnerability is exploitable even by untrusted applications running with limited privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable Avast Antivirus software is installed.
- **Ability to Send RPC Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to create and send RPC requests to the Avast service.
- **Low Integrity Process:** The attacker can execute the exploit from a low integrity process
