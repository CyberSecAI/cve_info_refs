  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2020-10727",
    "description": "A flaw was found in ActiveMQ Artemis management API from version 2.7.0 up until 2.12.0, where a user inadvertently stores passwords in plaintext in the Artemis shadow file (etc/artemis-users.properties file) when executing the `resetUsers` operation. A local attacker can use this flaw to read the contents of the Artemis shadow file.",
    "root_cause": "The `resetUsers` operation in the ActiveMQ Artemis management API stores the new password in plain text in the etc/artemis-users.properties file instead of hashing it.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Password stored in plaintext"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can read the contents of the Artemis shadow file containing plaintext passwords.",
        "attack_vector": "Local access to the system running ActiveMQ Artemis.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local attacker with the ability to read files on the system where ActiveMQ Artemis is running."
