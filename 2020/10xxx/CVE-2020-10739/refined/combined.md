| Disclosure Details | |
| --- | --- |
| CVE(s) | [CVE-2020-10739](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10739) |
| CVSS Impact Score | 7.5 [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV%3aN%2fAC%3aL%2fPR%3aN%2fUI%3aN%2fS%3aU%2fC%3aN%2fI%3aN%2fA%3aH&version=3.1) |
| Affected Releases | 1.4 to 1.4.81.5 to 1.5.3 |

Istio 1.4 with telemetry v2 enabled and Istio 1.5 contain the following vulnerability when telemetry v2 is enabled:

* **[CVE-2020-10739](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10739)**:
  By sending a specially crafted packet, an attacker could trigger a Null Pointer Exception resulting in a Denial of Service. This could be sent to the ingress gateway or a sidecar.
  + CVSS Score: 7.5 [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N&version=3.1)

## Mitigation

* For Istio 1.4.x deployments: update to [Istio 1.4.9](/latest/news/releases/1.4.x/announcing-1.4.9/) or later.
* For Istio 1.5.x deployments: update to [Istio 1.5.4](/latest/news/releases/1.5.x/announcing-1.5.4/) or later.

```
$ istioctl manifest apply --set values.telemetry.v2.enabled=false
```
