Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10665:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a vulnerability in the diagnostics feature of Docker Desktop. Specifically, the `com.docker.diagnose.exe` process creates a folder under the current user's AppData and generates a zip file with diagnostic data. Subsequently, the `com.docker.service` process grants full control permissions to this zip file for the "everyone" group. This behavior, combined with the ability for a non-privileged user to control the directory where this zip is created, leads to a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability when the file is created using the SYSTEM account..

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Arbitrary DACL overwrite:** The vulnerability allows a standard user to overwrite the Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) permissions of a file by manipulating the directory where the zip file is created during the diagnostics process.
*   **Arbitrary file write:** Through the above vulnerability, a low-privileged user can cause a privileged process to write to an arbitrary file.
*   **Hardlink abuse:** The vulnerability is further exploited by creating hard links to a system file. When the privileged process grants full control to the zip file, it effectively grants those permissions to the target system file as well.
*   **TOCTOU:** Due to the timing between when a user has access to the zip and when permissions are assigned by the privileged process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a non-privileged user to achieve local privilege escalation to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This occurs by first gaining control over a system DLL through the arbitrary DACL overwrite, then leveraging that control to execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM by overwriting the dll with a malicious payload, and finally triggering its execution using the XPS print service.

**Attack vectors:**

1.  **Triggering Diagnostics:** The attacker must initiate the Docker Desktop diagnostics data collection process, which can be done via the GUI.
2.  **Hardlink Spraying:** The attacker sprays hard links to a target system file within the directory.
3.  **DACL overwrite:** Docker service grants full permissions to the zip file under the controlled directory.
4.  **Arbitrary file overwrite:**  Once DACL is modified on a target system file, an attacker can overwrite that file with a malicious DLL.
5.  **Privilege Escalation:** By using the XPS print service, an attacker can load the modified DLL and execute code as SYSTEM.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local user account:** The attacker needs a standard user account on a Windows system where Docker Desktop is installed and vulnerable. They also must be part of the `docker-users` group.
*   **Ability to interact with the Docker Desktop GUI:** The attacker needs to be able to start the diagnostics data collection process through the GUI.
*   **Ability to create Hardlinks:** The attacker needs to be able to create hard links within the user's AppData folder.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Affected Products:**
    *   Docker Desktop Enterprise before 2.1.0.9
    *   Docker Desktop for Windows Stable before 2.2.0.4
    *   Docker Desktop for Windows Edge before 2.2.2.0
*   **Mitigation:** The vendor released a patch. Additionally, Microsoft introduced a hardlink mitigation in the March 2020 Windows cumulative update to prevent hardlink creation on files where the user does not have write access. This mitigation limits exploitability on patched versions of Windows.
