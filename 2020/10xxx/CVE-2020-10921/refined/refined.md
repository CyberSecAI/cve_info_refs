**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of authentication in the EA-HTTP.exe process, which allows alterations to the system configuration without requiring any authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Missing Authentication for Critical Function

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to issue commands to the physical equipment controlled by the device. Specifically, they can alter system configurations and potentially take full control of the device and its associated physical processes.

**Attack vectors:**
Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected device, and no prior authentication is needed.
