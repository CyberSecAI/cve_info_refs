s390/cmm: fix information leak in cmm\_timeout\_handler()The problem is that we were putting the NUL terminator too far:
buf[sizeof(buf) - 1] = '\0';
If the user input isn't NUL terminated and they haven't initialized the
whole buffer then it leads to an info leak. The NUL terminator should
be:
buf[len - 1] = '\0';

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1846380#c0)  Alex    2020-06-11 13:17:50 UTC  ``` In function cmm_timeout_hander in file arch/s390/mm/cmm.c, there is a logic error which set null byte too far away from user input which means user input won't be null terminated. And then, kernel stack data will be concatenated with user input and be processed. By querying the result, attacker is able to see the kernel data. This is linux kernel stack information leak on s390/s390x (and it is actual both for s390, ppc64 and ppc64le platforms).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1846380#c3)  Alex    2020-06-11 19:40:02 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1846531](show_bug.cgi?id=1846531 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-10773 kernel: kernel stack information leak on s390/s390x [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1846380#c5)  Alex    2020-06-11 19:51:45 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1846380#c9)  Petr Matousek    2020-06-17 12:39:00 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue is rated as having Low impact because of being limited to only s390 architecture and very limited kernel stack exposure.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1846380#c10)  Petr Matousek    2020-06-17 12:52:34 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b8e51a6a9db94bc1fb18ae831b3dab106b5a4b5f>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1846380#c11)  Justin M.

As such, we haven't performed the investigation on these product versions. Our metadata were saying the contrary, I fixed that.  Sorry for the confusion.
