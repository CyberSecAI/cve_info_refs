Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10773:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `cmm_timeout_handler` function within the Linux kernel's memory management for s390/s390x architectures.
- The function incorrectly sets the null terminator after copying data from user space. It uses `buf[sizeof(buf) - 1] = '\0';` which always writes to the end of the buffer, regardless of the actual length of the user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Leak:** If the user-provided input is shorter than the buffer size and not null-terminated, the subsequent operations can read beyond the intended user input, potentially exposing kernel stack data.
- **Incorrect Null Termination:** The logic for null-terminating the input buffer is flawed, leading to potential out-of-bounds reads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local attacker can potentially read kernel stack memory. This exposure of stack data can leak sensitive information about kernel operations, potentially aiding in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **File Operation:** The attacker manipulates the `/proc/sys/vm/cmm_timeout` file, likely by writing data to it that is shorter than the allocated buffer size.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A local user with the ability to write to the `/proc/sys/vm/cmm_timeout` file is required.

**Technical Details:**
- The code snippet below highlights the flawed logic:
```c
-       len = *lenp;
-       if (copy_from_user(buf, buffer,
-                   len > sizeof(buf) ? sizeof(buf) : len))
+       len = min(*lenp, sizeof(buf));
+       if (copy_from_user(buf, buffer, len))
                return -EFAULT;
-       buf[sizeof(buf) - 1] = '\0';
+       buf[len - 1] = '\0';
```

- The fix ensures that the null terminator is placed after the copied user data.
- The vulnerability was present in s390/s390x architectures. While the original bug report mentioned ppc64 and ppc64le platforms, this is contradicted by a later comment stating that the fix was only for s390/s390x

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has a low severity because it is limited to s390/s390x architecture, and the amount of kernel stack information leaked is small.
- This issue does not affect RHEL 5 or 6 because the relevant code was not present.
- The fix was introduced in kernel version 5.4-rc6.
