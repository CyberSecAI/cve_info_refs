{
  "CVE-2020-10958": {
    "Root cause": "Sending a command followed by a sufficient number of newlines triggers a use-after-free bug.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Improper handling of input data (CWE-20)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attacker can keep submission-login service down, causing denial of service attack. For lmtp the risk is negligible, as lmtp is usually behind a trusted MTA.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a command followed by a sufficient number of newlines to the submission or lmtp services.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "No special capabilities are mentioned beyond sending network traffic. No authentication is needed to exploit the submission service, but lmtp is typically behind a MTA."
