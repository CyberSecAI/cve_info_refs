- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect permission assignment for a critical resource, specifically a registry key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a result of the RSLinx Classic application having incorrect permissions set on a registry key.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local authenticated attacker can modify the registry key, leading to the execution of malicious code with system privileges when RSLinx Classic is opened. This could result in complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is local and requires an authenticated user to modify the registry key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access to the system and be an authenticated user.
