| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1841041#c0)  msiddiqu    2020-05-28 08:28:13 UTC  ``` The ifcfg-rh settings plugin does not handle the 802-1x.ca-path and 802-1x.phase2-ca-path settings.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1841041#c0)  msiddiqu    2020-05-28 08:28:13 UTC  ``` The ifcfg-rh settings plugin does not handle the 802-1x.ca-path and 802-1x.phase2-ca-path settings. When a user uses nmcli to configure a profile, it seemingly succeeds, while the modification gets silently lost leaving the connection unauthenticated.
