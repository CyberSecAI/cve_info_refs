      "details": "The provided content is a changelog for HashiCorp Vault, specifically including release notes for versions 1.16.0 through 1.18.3, and several 1.17.x and 1.16.x enterprise releases. The changelog includes various security fixes, features, improvements, and bug fixes. \n\nCVE-2020-10661 is not mentioned. \n\nThe content provides the following potentially relevant information that could be related to a future CVE:\n\n*   **1.18.3:**\n    *   core: fix bug in seal unwrapper that caused high storage latency in Vault CE. For every storage read request, the seal unwrapper was performing the read twice, and would also issue an unnecessary storage write.\n\n*   **1.18.1:**\n    *   core/raft: Add raft join limits. This is related to [HCSEC-2024-26](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2024-26-vault-vulnerable-to-denial-of-service-through-memory-exhaustion-when-processing-raft-cluster-join-requests), which describes a memory exhaustion vulnerability when processing raft cluster join requests.\n    *   audit: Prevent users from enabling multiple audit devices of file type with the same file\_path to write to. \n\n*   **1.18.0:**\n    *   secrets/identity: A privileged Vault operator with write permissions to the root namespace's identity endpoint could escalate their privileges to Vault's root policy (CVE-2024-9180) [HCSEC-2024-21].\n\n*   **1.17.7 Enterprise:**\n    *  secrets/identity: A privileged Vault operator with write permissions to the root namespace's identity endpoint could escalate their privileges to Vault's root policy (CVE-2024-9180) [HCSEC-2024-21].\n\n*   **1.17.6:**\n    *  secrets/ssh: require `valid_principals` to contain a value or `default_user` be set by default to guard against potentially insecure configurations. `allow_empty_principals` can be used for backwards compatibility [HCSEC-2024-20].\n\n*   **1.17.5:**\n    *   core/audit: fix regression where client tokens and token accessors were being displayed in the audit log in plaintext [HCSEC-2024-18].\n\n*   **1.16.10 Enterprise:**\n    *   secrets/ssh: require `valid_principals` to contain a value or `default_user` be set by default to guard against potentially insecure configurations. `allow_empty_principals` can be used for backwards compatibility [HCSEC-2024-20].\n\n*   **1.16.9 Enterprise:**\n    *   core/audit: fix regression where client tokens and token accessors were being displayed in the audit log in plaintext [HCSEC-2024-18].\n\n*   **1.16.0:**\n    *   auth/cert: compare public keys of trusted non-CA certificates with incoming client certificates to prevent trusting certs with the same serial number but not the same public/private key (CVE-2024-2048). [HSEC-2024-05]\n    *   auth/cert: validate OCSP response was signed by the expected issuer and serial number matched request (CVE-2024-2660) [HSEC-2024-07]\n    *   secrets/transit: fix a regression that was honoring nonces provided in non-convergent modes during encryption (CVE-2023-4680) [HSEC-2023-28]\n\nSeveral of these fixes are marked as security related and link to a HashiCorp security advisory. \n\nThe information extracted is more detailed than the CVE description, which is just a placeholder, and would provide context for a vulnerability if a CVE were assigned to the specific issues described.",
