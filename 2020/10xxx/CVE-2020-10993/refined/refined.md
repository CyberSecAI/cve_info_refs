- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability present in the `BinaryMapIndexReader.java` file within the OsmAnd project. The vulnerability stems from the insecure processing of XML input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is the improper handling of XML data where external entities are not disabled, leading to the XXE vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker could potentially exploit this XXE vulnerability to read local files or trigger denial-of-service attacks by including malicious XML entities in a map file. The details of what files an attacker could access is not given.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a specially crafted map file containing malicious XML entities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious map file that will be processed by the application.
