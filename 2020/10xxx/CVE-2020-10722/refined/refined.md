{
  "CVE-2020-10722": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in `vhost_user_set_log_base()` due to missing check for overflow when adding offset and size of the log memory map. The resulting sum is used as the size when calling `mmap()`. When an overflow occurs, a smaller memory map is created than requested.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow, missing input validation, memory corruption.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access through a vhost-user backend application with a malicious guest or container.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control the size and offset of the log memory map when setting the logging base in vhost-user, requiring a privileged position on the host or a malicious guest OS."
  },
  "CVE-2020-10723": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer truncation on the index of a payload.  The index (a UInt) is copied and truncated into a uint16.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer truncation, out-of-bounds indexing.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access through a vhost-user backend application with a malicious guest or container.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control the index of the payload, requiring a privileged position on the host or a malicious guest OS."
  },
    "CVE-2020-10724": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing validations for user-supplied values in vhost-crypto library code.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing input validation, out-of-bounds memory read.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Information leak through an out-of-bounds memory read.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access through a vhost-user backend application with a malicious guest or container.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to supply values used by the vhost-crypto library, requiring a privileged position on the host or a malicious guest OS."
  },
  "CVE-2020-10725": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing validity check of the descriptor address in the function `virtio_dev_rx_batch_packed()`",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing input validation, segmentation fault.",
     "Impact of exploitation": "Segmentation fault of the vhost-user backend application, which could result in a loss of connectivity for other guests.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network access through a malicious guest OS sending invalid Virtio descriptor.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a malicious guest OS capable of sending invalid Virtio descriptor."
  },
  "CVE-2020-10726": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Message flooding using `VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing resource limits or proper checks leading to denial of service.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access through a vhost-user backend application with a malicious guest or container.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to flood the `VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD` message, requiring a privileged position on the host or a malicious guest OS."
