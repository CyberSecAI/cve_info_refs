{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `request_uri` parameter in the OIDC Authentication Request allows specifying an external URI where the Request object can be found. The Identity Provider (IdP) fetches this external object, making it vulnerable to SSRF.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can force the Keycloak server to make requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially exposing internal services or data.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious OIDC Authentication Request with a `request_uri` parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled server or internal resource.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to initiate an OIDC Authentication Request to the vulnerable Keycloak server."
