  "CVE-2020-10730": {
    "description": "A NULL pointer dereference, or possible use-after-free flaw was found in Samba AD LDAP server in versions before 4.10.17, before 4.11.11 and before 4.12.4. Although some versions of Samba shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux do not support Samba in AD mode, the affected code is shipped with the libldb package. This flaw allows an authenticated user to possibly trigger a use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Samba AD DC LDAP server",
      "libldb"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The flaw occurs due to the way samba handles certain requests as an Active Directory Domain Controller LDAP server, specifically when the 'ASQ' and 'VLV' LDAP controls are combined, possibly in conjunction with paged_results.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service, leading to system unavailability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated user on the network is required to exploit this vulnerability."
