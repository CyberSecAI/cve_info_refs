- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability was caused by the ability to recursively request several features from each other leading to a denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can cause a denial of service of a GitLab instance.
- **Attack vectors:**  Exploitation is performed by using several features to recursively request each other.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the GitLab instance.
