Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-10644:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the **deserialization of untrusted data**. The affected product lacks proper validation of user-supplied data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502):**  The software does not properly validate user-supplied data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious serialized data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to **remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges**.
*   An attacker could also gain the ability to obtain sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is **exploitable remotely** over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs **network access** to the vulnerable service.
*   The attacker does not require any authentication. It is exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   A low skill level is required to exploit this vulnerability.
