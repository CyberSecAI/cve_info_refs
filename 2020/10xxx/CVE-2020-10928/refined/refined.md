- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow due to lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a fixed-length buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of string table file uploads. The vulnerability is due to missing length validation of user-supplied data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the web server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a malicious string table file during the file upload process. Authentication is not required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be network-adjacent to the affected NETGEAR R6700 router, and does not require prior authentication.
