- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Firebird database used by Psyprax is accessible with the default username 'sysdba' and password 'masterke' after installation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of hardcoded default credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain full access to the database, allowing them to read and modify any data, including passwords. This could lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially sensitive patient data.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the Firebird database server or direct access to local database files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the server hosting the Firebird database, or local access to the server's filesystem. No authentication is required to connect to the database as long as the database server is accessible, given the default credentials are in place.
