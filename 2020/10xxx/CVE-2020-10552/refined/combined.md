# NEWS

X41 D-Sec GmbH Security Advisory: X41-2020-002

# Multiple Vulnerabilities in Psyprax 3.1.2.2

**Highest Severity Rating:** Critical

**Confirmed Affected Versions:** 3.1.2.2

**Confirmed Patched Versions:** 3.2.2

**Vendor:** Psyprax GmbH

**Vendor URL:** https://www.psyprax.de/

**Credit:** X41 D-Sec GmbH, Eric Sesterhenn

**Status:** Public

**Advisory-URL:** https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2020-002-psyprax

## Summary and Impact

Several passwords were not protected properly, which might help an attacker gain access or elevate privileges.

## Product Description

Psyprax allows you to manage a medical office and patients.

# Screensaver Password not protected

**Severity Rating:** High

**Vector:** Local User

**CVE:** CVE-2020-10553

**CWE:** 522

**CVSS Score:** 8.8

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

## Analysis

The file C:\ProgramData\Psyprax32\PPScreen.ini contains a hash for the lockscreen of the application. If that entry is removed, the lockscreen is no longer displayed and the app is no longer locked. All local users are able to modify that file.

## Workarounds

Use proper Windows screen locking.

# Firebird Database accessible with default password

**Severity Rating:** Critical

**Vector:** Network

**CVE:** CVE-2020-10552

**CWE:** 862

**CVSS Score:** 9.8

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

## Analysis

The Firebird database is accessible with the default user âsysdbaâ and password âmasterkeâ after installation. This allows any user to access it and read and modify the contents, including passwords. Local database files can be accessed directly as well.

## Workarounds

Properly firewall the database and set a password.

# Passwords not securely stored

**Severity Rating:** High

**Vector:** Local

**CVE:** CVE-2020-10554

**CWE:** 257

**CVSS Score:** 8.8

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

## Analysis

Passwords used to encrypt the data are stored in the database in an obfuscated format, which can be easily reverted. For example the password âAAAAAAAAâ is stored in the database as âMMMMMMMMâ.

These can be retrieved via the database:

SQL> select \* from K\_CFP\_CONFIG\_PARAM where K\_CFP\_PARAM = âCryptPasswordâ;

## Workarounds

A proper password storage algorithm that includes a salt and is strong enough to prevent brute force attacks, such as argon2, scrypt or bcrypt, should be implemented.
