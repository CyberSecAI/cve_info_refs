Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-10696:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how Buildah handles tar files during the image building process. Specifically, if Buildah fails to fetch the content (e.g., a Dockerfile) used as a parameter for building, it tries to refetch it again without properly cleaning up the build directory. This behavior, combined with the improper handling of symlinks within the fetched tar file, allows for a path traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:**  A crafted tar file with symlinks can trick Buildah into writing files to arbitrary locations on the user's filesystem, outside of the intended build directory.
*   **Improper Error Handling:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by Buildah's failure to properly clean up the build directory after a failed fetch attempt, leading to the possibility of a refetch and overwrite scenario.
*  **Refetching without cleanup:** Buildah was refetching content without cleaning up the build directory which can lead to a file overwrite via a symlink.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite any file on the system that the user running Buildah has write permissions to.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** This can lead to loss of confidentiality (by overwriting configuration files), loss of integrity (by modifying system files), and potentially loss of availability (by overwriting critical files leading to denial of service).
*   **Potential Code Execution:**  Overwriting specific files could also allow for arbitrary code execution if the user executes the overwritten file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Tar File:** An attacker crafts a tar file containing symlinks that, when extracted by Buildah, point to sensitive locations on the user's file system.
*   **HTTP(s) Server:** This malicious tar file is hosted on a server controlled by the attacker.
*   **Buildah Command:** The user is tricked into using a buildah command to build a malicious container image hosted on an attacker controlled server, which downloads and extracts the crafted tar file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a malicious tar file on a web server.**
*   **Ability to entice a user to run a Buildah command that points to the attacker-controlled server.**
*   No privileges required, only user interaction in the form of running a build command.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is triggered when `buildah bud` command is used to build an image from an attacker controlled http server.
* The fix involves preventing the refetching of content if a file read fails.
