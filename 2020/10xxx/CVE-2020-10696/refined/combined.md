# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Currently if buildah fails to fetch the content used as parameter for building, it tries to refetch it again without properly cleanup the build directory. An attack may leverage this by crafting a malicious input which will force buildah to overwrite any existing file which task's owner has write access.   ```  [Comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=1817651#c42)  Daniel Walsh    2020-04-06 13:55:49 UTC  ``` I agree this is low, no one is using podman on a Openshift nodes, directly, it is only being used for the install and maintenance of images.  Therefore noone is going to execute podman build.   ```  [Comment 43](show_bug.cgi?id=1817651#c43)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-14 12:29:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.2  Via RHSA-2020:1401 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1401](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1401)   ```  [Comment 44](show_bug.cgi?id=1817651#c44)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-14 15:37:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.3  Via RHSA-2020:1396 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1396](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1396)   ```  [Comment 45](show_bug.cgi?id=1817651#c45)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-04-14 16:31:48 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Podman is also included in OpenShift Container Platform, but it isn't used to perform a build, so it has been given a low impact rating.  OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 now used podman from the RHEL Extra repository, and not the podman package shipped in the OpenShift 3.11 RPM repository. This issue is fixed in podman in RHEL Extras so we won't fix the podman package shipped in the OpenShift 3.11 RPM repository.   ```  [Comment 48](show_bug.cgi?id=1817651#c48)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-28 20:53:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:1926 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1926](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1926)   ```  [Comment 49](show_bug.cgi?id=1817651#c49)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-28 20:54:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:1931 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1931](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1931)   ```  [Comment 50](show_bug.cgi?id=1817651#c50)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-28 20:54:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:1932 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1932](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1932)   ```  [Comment 51](show_bug.cgi?id=1817651#c51)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-05-12 19:50:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras  Via RHSA-2020:2116 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2116](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A2116)   ```  [Comment 52](show_bug.cgi?id=1817651#c52)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-05-12 19:50:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras  Via RHSA-2020:2117 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2117](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A2117)   ``` |  |
