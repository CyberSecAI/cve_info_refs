The provided content is related to CVE-2020-10984.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Gambio GX application lacks CSRF protection on critical functions within the shop backend.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can force an authenticated backend user to execute unwanted actions, potentially leading to code execution on the server. As demonstrated in the proof of concept, an attacker can upload a PHP webshell and gain arbitrary code execution. They can also perform actions like viewing sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page. The victim, an authenticated backend user, visits this page and unknowingly triggers the malicious actions by clicking on a submit button.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML page and lure an authenticated Gambio GX backend user to visit it. The attacker does not need direct access to the Gambio GX server; the attack relies on the user's existing session.
