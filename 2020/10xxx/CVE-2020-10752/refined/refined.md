The provided content relates to a pull request aiming to enhance the security of OAuth resource storage in OpenShift. While the content doesn't directly describe a vulnerability, it discusses changes to mitigate potential security issues related to how OAuth access and authorization tokens are stored and handled. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability (addressed by the PR):**

- The original storage format for OAuth access and authorization tokens was not secure. The tokens were stored in a way that could allow an attacker, who gained access to the etcd storage, to use these tokens to impersonate any OAuth authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present (before the fix):**

- **Insecure token storage:** The full bearer token was directly stored, making it vulnerable if the storage was compromised.
- **Potential for unauthorized access:**  If an attacker gained access to the etcd storage, they could extract the stored tokens and use them to gain unauthorized access to the cluster as any authenticated user.

**Impact of exploitation (before the fix):**

- **Complete cluster compromise:** An attacker with access to the etcd storage could potentially gain full control over the OpenShift cluster by impersonating legitimate users.

**Attack vectors (before the fix):**

- **Compromise of etcd storage:** Direct access to the etcd storage where the tokens were stored.
- **etcdctl access:** Usage of etcdctl to extract the tokens.

**Required attacker capabilities/position (before the fix):**

- Direct access to the etcd storage or the ability to use etcdctl to access it.

**Proposed solution (from the PR):**

- Change the `oauthaccesstokens` and `oauthauthorizetokens` storage format and schema.
- The new format involves storing a hash (SHA256) of the token instead of the plain text token.
- The bearer token would carry a prefix (e.g. "sha256:") and the original token, but the server would use the hashed token for authorization.
- Kube-apiserver would split the provided bearer token into the first 43 bytes (256 bits) to lookup token objects and authorize clients.

**Additional details:**

- The pull request mentions that old kube-apiservers would fail to lookup the token object using the whole token on downgrade requiring reauthentication of clients.
- The default expiry for `oauthaccesstokens` is one day.
- `oauthauthorizetokens` are usually short lived and deleted once an `oauthaccesstoken` is retrieved.

In essence, this pull request addresses a significant security concern by modifying the token storage mechanism to make it much more difficult to compromise the cluster, even if an attacker gains access to the underlying storage. It does not describe a specific CVE but rather a security improvement that prevents a potential vulnerability.
