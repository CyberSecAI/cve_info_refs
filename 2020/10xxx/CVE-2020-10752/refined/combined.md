shouldn't the new Kube invalidate the old (not secure) tokens? If yes, does it have an impact on upgrades?

This section should also include details on the tokens' creation and handling in the oauth-server as this would also need some changes, see the storage implementation we use to plug into osin:

<https://github.com/openshift/oauth-server/blob/31279d2cabc12e26f7ab716b5f65e055214d372f/pkg/osinserver/registrystorage/storage.go>

As an example that stands out, OAuthAuthorizeTokens' storage is specifically used during the authorization code grant in <https://github.com/openshift/oauth-server/blob/31279d2cabc12e26f7ab716b5f65e055214d372f/vendor/github.com/RangelReale/osin/access.go#L183-L183>.

These changes will most likely be small, yet worth mentioning.

This will break some test cases and potentially some very rarely used features around direct token assignment. Please call that out.

I'd like to also place a character we expect at byte 44 so that when we change this in the future (and I bet we will), we'll have something clear to look for.

My only concern would be what N and (N-1) are if a user attempts an emergency unsupported rollback to N-1. And if we are certain that their N-1 has support for `sha256:` tokens.

Worst that can happen is that users have to relogin.

To be clear: this means that we add sha256 support in 4.n-1.x. If the customer does a downgrade to that, everything keeps working. If the the customer does a downgrade to 4.n-1.x-1, then users have to relogin, but otherwise things keep working. So it is similar as tokens that expire (after a day by default), but enforced by the unsupported downgrade.
