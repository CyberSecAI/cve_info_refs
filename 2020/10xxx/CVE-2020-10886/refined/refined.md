- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the `tmpServer` service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process on the affected TP-Link Archer A7 router.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network attack through TCP port 20002.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to send network traffic to port 20002 of the vulnerable device.
