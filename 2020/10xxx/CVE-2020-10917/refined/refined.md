Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10917:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the RMI service of NEC ESMPRO Manager. This leads to the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **RMI Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core weakness is that the application deserializes data received via the RMI service without proper validation. This allows an attacker to send malicious serialized objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **SYSTEM Level Privileges:** The attacker can execute the malicious code within the context of the SYSTEM user, granting them full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network (Remote):** The attack can be initiated remotely over a network.
- **RMI Service:** The vulnerability exists specifically within the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) service of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable system's RMI service.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 11.0.5 of NEC ESMPRO Manager.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-01-16 and publicly disclosed on 2020-06-01.
- The CVSS score is 9.8, indicating a critical severity. The CVSS vector string is: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (Network, Low Attack Complexity, No Privileges Required, No User Interaction, Unchanged Scope, High Confidentiality Impact, High Integrity Impact, High Availability Impact).
