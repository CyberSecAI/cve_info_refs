The provided content is related to CVE-2020-10282, not CVE-2020-10283. However, the issue described does include detailed information about a vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink) protocol version 1.0 lacks an authentication mechanism.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- No authentication or authorization in MAVLink v1.0
- Optional package signing in MAVLink v2.0 (which is not enforced)
- Weak authentication in v2.0 based on a symmetric key, which, if compromised, jeopardizes the entire system

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Identity spoofing
- Unauthorized access
- Person-in-the-middle (PITM) attacks
- Potential full compromise of the flying system

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation of the lack of authentication in the MAVLink protocol.
- Potential for attacks if the symmetric key used in MAVLink v2.0 is compromised.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the MAVLink communication channel.
- Ability to send and receive MAVLink messages.
-  If exploiting v2.0, access to the shared symmetric key.
