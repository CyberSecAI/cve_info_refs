The provided content is related to CVE-2020-10207.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded credentials within the EntoneWebEngine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hard-coded username ("fe") and password ("fe!@#") for the EntoneWebEngine web server.
- Lack of authentication when accessing the server on port 10080 from localhost.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows an attacker to log in to the webserver running on the device.
- Once logged in, an attacker could access information about the device (e.g. what channel is being watched, the volume and resolution, etc.), as well as modify device settings such as channel and volume.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access to the device's webserver on ports 10080 or 10443.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to know the hard-coded credentials "fe" and "fe!@#".
- For access to port 10443, the attacker would need the credentials. Access to port 10080 from localhost does not require credentials.
