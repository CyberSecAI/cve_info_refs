Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `Doorkeeper::Application` model's default serialization behavior, which, when exposed through the `/oauth/authorized_applications.json` endpoint, disclosed all model attributes, including sensitive information such as client secrets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information. The `as_json` method of the `Doorkeeper::Application` model, which is used for JSON serialization, was not properly restricting the attributes being exposed.
- **Lack of Attribute Filtering:** The application failed to filter which attributes should be included in the JSON response, leading to unintended exposure of the client secret and other potentially sensitive attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Secrets:** An attacker could obtain client secrets, which could potentially lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation or other forms of exploitation.
- **Broader Data Exposure:** Besides secrets, other application details, though not as sensitive as the client secret, were also disclosed, potentially providing attackers with useful information for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability was accessible remotely over the network via the `/oauth/authorized_applications.json` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authorized Application:** The attacker needed to have an authorized application, meaning they had to be a legitimate user of an OAuth client to trigger this vulnerability. They were able to exploit this vulnerability by accessing the aforementioned endpoint.
- **No special privileges:** The attacker did not need any special or elevated privileges to access the endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding an `as_json` method to the `Doorkeeper::Application` model that restricts which attributes are serialized to a minimal set by default.
- The fix also introduces a check for authorized owners to return all attributes, which are available if the request is made with `as_owner: true` parameter.
- A workaround was suggested to patch the `Doorkeeper::Application` model's `#as_json` method to define only the attributes that should be exposed.
- The advisory also recommends enabling application secrets hashing, which would render exposed secrets useless.
- The affected versions included >= 5.0.0 and patched versions were 5.0.3, 5.1.1, 5.2.5, and 5.3.2.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity by the doorkeeper advisory and "High" severity by GitHub.
- The vulnerability has been assigned the CWE ID CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).
