# Information disclosure for Application model

Moderate

[nbulaj](/nbulaj)
published
GHSA-j7vx-8mqj-cqp9
May 2, 2020

## Package

bundler

doorkeeper
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 5.0.0

## Patched versions

5.0.3, 5.1.1, 5.2.5, 5.3.2

## Description

### Impact

Information disclosure vulnerability. Allows an attacker to see all `Doorkeeper::Application` model attribute values (including secrets) using authorized applications controller if it's enabled (GET /oauth/authorized\_applications.json).

### Patches

These versions have the fix:

* 5.0.3
* 5.1.1
* 5.2.5
* 5.3.2

### Workarounds

Patch `Doorkeeper::Application` model `#as_json(options = {})` method and define only those attributes you want to expose.

Additional recommended hardening is to enable application secrets hashing ([guide](https://doorkeeper.gitbook.io/guides/security/token-and-application-secrets)), available since Doorkeeper 5.1. This would render the exposed secret useless.

### References

* Commit with fix: [25d0380](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/commit/25d038022c2fcad45af5b73f9d003cf38ff491f6)
* <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10187>

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-10187

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

|  |  | ## master |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - [#1371] Add `#as\_json` method and attributes serialization restriction for Application model. |
|  |  | Fixes information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2020-10187). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \*\*[IMPORTANT]\*\* you need to re-implement `#as\_json` method for Doorkeeper Application model |
|  |  | if you previously used `#to\_json` serialization with custom options or attributes or rely on |
|  |  | JSON response from /oauth/applications.json or /oauth/authorized\_applications.json. This change |
|  |  | is a breaking change which restricts serialized attributes to a very small set of columns. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - [#1395] Fix `NameError: uninitialized constant Doorkeeper::AccessToken` for Rake tasks. |
|  |  | - [#1397] Add `as: :doorkeeper\_application` on Doorkeeper application form in order to support |
|  |  | custom configured application model. |
