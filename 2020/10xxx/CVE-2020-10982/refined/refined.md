Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-10982:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection found in the Gambio GX webshop application.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `admin/gv_mail.php` file, specifically between lines 361 and 365.
- The GET parameter `cID` is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or use of parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection because the user-supplied input `cID` is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in an SQL query. The application does not directly output the results of the injected query, which classifies it as a blind SQL injection. This can make it harder to detect and exploit.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with administrative privileges can exploit this vulnerability to leak database contents.
- Successful exploitation would enable the attacker to extract sensitive information stored in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface, specifically by manipulating the GET parameter `cID` in a request to `admin/gv_mail.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrative privileges in the Gambio GX webshop application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided proof of concept shows how an attacker can introduce a time delay in the response using SQL injection, which is a common technique in exploiting blind SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- The vendor has released a fix in version 4.0.1.0, which should mitigate this vulnerability by implementing parameterized queries or other appropriate defenses against SQL injection.
- The advisory recommends using parameterized queries (prepared statements) as the primary way to mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities.
