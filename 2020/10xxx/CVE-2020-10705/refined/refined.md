Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10705:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Undertow handles the "Expect: 100-continue" header in HTTP requests. Specifically, certain requests using this header can trigger an out-of-memory condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Memory Exhaustion:** The core issue is a memory exhaustion vulnerability due to improper handling of the "Expect: 100-continue" header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition, as the memory exhaustion can render the affected service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests that include the "Expect: 100-continue" header.
*   **Network:** The attacker needs to send these requests over the network to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Undertow version 2.1.1.Final.
*   Several Red Hat products were affected including JBoss Enterprise Application Platform and OpenShift Application Runtimes.
*   Multiple NetApp products that incorporate Undertow were also affected, specifically Active IQ Unified Manager and OnCommand Insight.
*   There is no known mitigation other than patching.
