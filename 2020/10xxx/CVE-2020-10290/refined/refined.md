The content is related to CVE-2020-10290.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Universal Robots controller executes URCaps (zip files containing Java-powered applications) without any permission restrictions. The URCaps have access to a wide API that presents many primitives that can compromise the overall robot operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted execution of URCaps, leading to an "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges" (CWE-250).
- Lack of sandboxing and isolation for URCaps.
- Wide API access for URCaps with no access controls.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious actor can create a custom URCap that, when deployed (intentionally or unintentionally) by a user, can compromise the system, potentially leading to:
- Full compromise of the robot system.
- Consumption of all computational resources of the robot.

**Attack vectors:**
- Creation of a crafted URCap by a malicious actor.
- Deployment of the crafted URCap by the user, either intentionally or unintentionally.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a URCap (zip file containing Java applications).
- The attacker needs to be able to get the crafted URCap to be deployed on the targeted Universal Robot.
