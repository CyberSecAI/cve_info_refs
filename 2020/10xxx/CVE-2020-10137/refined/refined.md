Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-10137:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the inadequate authentication and encryption of `FIND_NODE_IN_RANGE` frames in Z-Wave devices based on Silicon Labs 700 series chipsets when using S2 security.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Insufficient authentication and encryption for `FIND_NODE_IN_RANGE` frames in devices using the S2 security protocol.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker within Z-Wave radio range can intercept, observe, and potentially manipulate traffic.
*   The vulnerability can lead to unauthorized control of vulnerable devices.
*   Denial of service, device crashes and battery depletion may also result from exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the Z-Wave radio interface, by sending specially crafted `FIND_NODE_IN_RANGE` frames.
*   An attacker needs to be within the Z-Wave radio range to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be within radio range of the vulnerable Z-Wave devices.
*   They need the ability to craft and send malicious Z-Wave packets, specifically `FIND_NODE_IN_RANGE` frames.
