### Commits on Feb 24, 2020

1. [Fix sync issues with external accounts > 4GiB](/Zimbra/zm-mailbox/commit/05fd58aeecdbc2e23a7c9cd275e3beb155a6eb77)
    …

   ```
   In ZCS 8.8.15_GA_3869, external accounts that are larger than 4 GiB fail to
   sync because a database query returns a number that does not fit into an
   integer, but getDataSourceUsage() attempts to call ResultSet.getInt() on it.

   This raises an SQLException, which gets eventually converted into a message
   similar to the following, which ends up being displayed to the user:

   | Error: system failure: Folder sync failed, system failure:
   | Synchronization of folder '/DATASOURCE/Inbox' failed, system failure:
   | UID FETCH failed: com.zimbra.cs.mailclient.CommandFailedException: UID
   | FETCH failed: Error in response, UID FETCH failed: Error in response,
   | Exception in response handler, system failure: Unable to get size of
   | dataSource DATASOURCE, Out of range value for column 'sum(mi.size)'
   | : value 7279378627 is not in class java.lang.Integer range

   Fix this issue by using a long as return value and obtaining the value
   from the ResultSet as long.
   ```

### @sneha-patil-synacor **[sneha-patil-synacor](/sneha-patil-synacor)** commented [Feb 12, 2020](#issue-563909357)

Issue:

Any authenticated user can request any GAL account

Fix:

Added condition to check if the authenticated account is on same domain as that of galsync account in request. If not, throw permission denied.

Testing done:

Manual testing done with user and galsync account on different domains

Sorry, something went wrong.
