Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-10194:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the `AutoCompleteGal` class within the Zimbra Collaboration Suite. Specifically, any authenticated user was able to request any Global Address List (GAL) account, regardless of whether they belonged to the same domain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The code did not enforce that the authenticated user and the GAL account being accessed were in the same domain, allowing unauthorized access to GAL data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to GAL entries of different domains, leading to exposure of sensitive information like names, email addresses, and other contact details.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable through network access to the Zimbra server.
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be a valid authenticated user of the Zimbra system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must possess valid credentials for a Zimbra account within the system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the Zimbra server.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involves adding a check in the `AutoCompleteGal.java` file. The code now verifies that the authenticated user's account and the GAL account being requested belong to the same domain. If they are not on the same domain, a `PERM_DENIED` ServiceException is thrown, preventing access.

```java
if (galAcctId != null) {
    Account galAccount = Provisioning.getInstance().getAccountById(galAcctId);
    if (galAccount != null && (!account.getDomainId().equals(galAccount.getDomainId()))) {
        throw ServiceException
            .PERM_DENIED("can not access galsync account of different domain");
    }
    params.setGalSyncAccount(galAccount);
}
```
This check ensures that a user can only access GAL entries for accounts within their domain.
