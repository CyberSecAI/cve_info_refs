{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of proper validation on first-time setup requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper authentication, privilege escalation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can reset the password for the Admin account and execute code in the context of the device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-adjacent access.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device. Although authentication is required, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed."
