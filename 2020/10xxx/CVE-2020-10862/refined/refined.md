The provided content relates to CVE-2020-10862.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `aswTask` RPC endpoint of the `TaskEx` library within the Avast Service (`AvastSvc.exe`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `aswTask` RPC endpoint does not properly restrict access, allowing attackers to call privileged functions from low integrity processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Local Privilege Escalation (LPE): An attacker can escalate their privileges on the local system via RPC.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs via RPC calls to the `aswTask` endpoint of the `TaskEx` library within the Avast Service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to communicate with the Avast RPC service. This can be achieved from a low integrity process on the local system.
