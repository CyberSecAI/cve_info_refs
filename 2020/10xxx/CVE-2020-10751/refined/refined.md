Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10751:

**1. Verification of Content Relevance**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2020-10751 and describes the vulnerability in the context of a Linux kernel update. Thus, the content is **RELEVANT** to the CVE.

**2. Extraction of Vulnerability Information**

*   **Root Cause:**
    The vulnerability stems from an incorrect assumption in the SELinux LSM (Linux Security Module) hook implementation for netlink messages. The SELinux hook, specifically `selinux_netlink_send()`, assumed that a socket buffer (`skb`) would only ever contain a *single* netlink message.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    The core weakness is that `selinux_netlink_send()` only validated the first netlink message within an skb. Consequently, any subsequent netlink messages within the same `skb` were allowed or denied based solely on the first message's permissions, bypassing individual security checks for each message.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** A privileged attacker could exploit this weakness to bypass SELinux restrictions on netlink messages. Because the hook would validate only the first message, a specially crafted skb with an allowed message followed by a disallowed message would allow the disallowed message to pass.
    *  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although not the primary impact, one advisory mention that the root cause (handling of multiple netlink messages) could cause crashes.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local:** The attacker would need to have local access to the system to send crafted netlink messages using the netlink interface.
    *   **Privileged:** This vulnerability requires a user that can create, send and modify netlink messages.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to have the ability to construct and send netlink messages and have a local account on the system.
    *  An attacker would also need the necessary privileges to trigger a netlink policy decision in the kernel.

**Additional Technical Details**

The vulnerability is in the SELinux LSM hook function `selinux_netlink_send`, which is called for netlink messages being sent by a socket. The description notes that prior to the fix:

   *    The code "incorrectly assumed that an skb would only contain a single netlink message."
   *    The hook "would incorrectly only validate the first netlink message in the skb and allow or deny the rest of the messages within the skb with the granted permission without further processing."

The fix, included in the provided diff from the Linux kernel git tree, demonstrates that the loop has been added to process all netlink messages within the given buffer:

    while (data\_len >= nlmsg\_total\_size(0)) {
        nlh = (struct nlmsghdr \*)data;
        ...
        rc = selinux\_nlmsg\_lookup(sclass, nlh->nlmsg\_type, &perm);

**Additional Insights from the Content:**

*   The fix addresses the assumption of a single message per `skb` by iterating over and checking every message in the buffer.
*   The vulnerability exists due to improper handling of multiple netlink messages within a single sk\_buff.
*   The fix ensures SELinux applies access controls to each netlink message in the skb.
* Some advisories note that the vulnerability exists because the SELinux code does a single validation, when it should loop.
* The vulnerability is described as a "bypass" of SELinux restrictions for netlink messages.
* While the primary impact is privilege escalation, the content also refers to crashes which are often also caused by this code.
* One of the Red Hat advisories notes that there is currently no known ability to abuse the flaw.
* Some advisories also note that this issue does not affect systems where CONFIG\_NETLABEL is not enabled.

**Content Providing More Detail than CVE Description**

*   The provided content clarifies that the `selinux_netlink_send` function was the problematic code.
*   The content explains that the hook failed to iterate over messages in the buffer.
*   The openSUSE advisory clarifies that the vulnerability is a bypass.
*   The Debian advisory clarifies that the issue is present since Linux-2.6.12-rc2, indicating the extensive timeline for this vulnerability.
