    "summary": "The provided content details a use-after-free vulnerability in Foxit Reader related to AcroForms object handling. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The attack vector involves user interaction via opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious web page. Additional information from Foxit's website mentions that the use-after-free occurs due to the use of a wild or null pointer without proper validation, and it affects the handling of AcroForms, checkbox objects, or 3D page objects, leading to potential remote code execution."
