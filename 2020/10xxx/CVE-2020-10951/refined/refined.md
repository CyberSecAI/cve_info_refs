**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **clickjacking vulnerability** present in the My Cloud Home and ibi portal websites. This vulnerability allowed an attacker to trick a user into clicking on an unintended webpage element.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Clickjacking:** The primary vulnerability is clickjacking. This occurs when an attacker loads a target website within a frame controlled by the attacker. By overlaying the legitimate site with malicious elements, the attacker can manipulate the user's clicks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Redirection to Malicious Destinations:** Exploitation could lead users to be redirected to a destination chosen by the attacker for malicious purposes.
*   **Confidential Information Exposure:** Attackers could use this vulnerability to potentially reveal confidential information by manipulating user actions on the website.
*   **System Control:**  In severe cases, successful clickjacking attacks could give the attacker complete control over a user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
