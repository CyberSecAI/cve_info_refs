# End Of Support and Service for ibi

Information about ibi end of service and support\*END

WD is focused on providing exceptional customer experiences with our products. With that focus, from time to time we retire legacy products that are no longer consistent with the company’s customer experience ecosystem.

Starting **August 31st, 2024** there will be no software updates to the ibi device, Android and iOS mobile apps, and web app.

After August 31st, 2024 your device will no longer have remote access, receive security updates, or be eligible for technical support. As a result, you’ll only be able to access your device and content locally, if local access is enabled before August 31st, 2024.

If you are still using your ibi device, you can continue to access it using the mobile and web apps till that date. However, when there are changes in the operating system and services that ibi integrates with, product features might stop working and will not be fixed. Your data will still be accessible on your device, if local access is enabled before August 31st, 2024.

1. **What does no longer supported mean?**

   Starting August 31st, 2024 there will be no software updates to the ibi device, Android and iOS mobile apps, and web app. After August 31st, 2024, your device will no longer have remote access, receive security updates, or be eligible for technical support.

3. **When is support ending?**

   Support will end on August 31st, 2024.

5. **Can I continue to use the product/service after August 31st, 2024?**

   You will be able to access the content on your ibi device via **Local Access**, if it is enabled before August 31st, 2024. You will not be able to login to your mobile and web app after this date to use any additional functionality.

7. **Will I lose any data?**

   When remote access via mobile and web app is gone, there will be no impact on the content on your device. You will be able to access your content as descibed below under "How can I access my content in ibi from my computer without ibi mobile and web apps?"

9. **How can I access my content in ibi from my computer without ibi mobile and web apps?**

   There are multiple ways in which you can have continued access to your content.

   You will now need to access them in one of the following ways:

   * **Local Access:** You can continue to access your data on the ibi device via your local network using the Local Access feature. This feature lets you directly access your personal files from a compatible Windows® or macOS computer connected to the same network as your device. If you have not enabled Local Access already, please do so before August 31st, 2024.

   * **USB Export:** Prior to August 31st, 2024, you can extract all the content from your ibi device to any external USB drive. This feature is available in the ibi mobile and web apps and lets you move content from your ibi device to a connected USB drive.

10. **What happens if my local access is not working even after enabling it?**

    Need more help?

    [Answer ID 50524: How to Enable Local Network Access to Data on SanDisk ibi Using the Dashboard with Cloud Services](/app/answers/detail/a_id/50524)

12. **Can I lose my Local Access even after enabling it?**

    You will be able to access the content on your ibi device via Local Access if it is enabled before August 31st, 2024. However, after this date, if you perform a hard factory reset (physically on the device) or update your home's Wi-Fi configuration (e.g., password change, network change), there is a possibility that your local access will be lost. Since the mobile and web apps will no longer be accessible, you will not be able to turn on the access again.

    **IMPORTANT:**

    Western Digital Support will not be able to assist you in such cases, please ensure you have a backup of your ibi data.

14. **Will I still be able to import data from Google Drive, Google Photos and Dropbox?**

    No, you will not be able to import content from any of the currently supported providers after August 31st, 2024. Any content imported before this date will not be impacted and will stay on your device. You can always download your social and cloud content on your computer and move it to ibi over local network, if Local Access is enabled before August 31st, 2024.

    At any time you can disconnect your cloud provider's account from your ibi device by first logging into that connected account and then in the Settings remove/disconnect the app called **EdgeRover Native**.

21. **What will happen to the backups on my Elephant Drive account?**

    Your existing content and backups on Elephant Drive will not be impacted and you will be able to access it directly via your Elephant Drive account even after August 31st, 2024. Although, after this date, any scheduled backups from ibi to Elephant Drive will no longer be performed, and you will also not be able to restore backups from Elephant Drive directly to your ibi device.

    At any time you can remove the ibi backup job on Elephant Drive by following these steps:
    1. Login to your **Elephant Drive account**.
    2. Got to **Backup Settings**.
    3. Select **ibi device**.
    4. **Delete** the backup job.

#### Manually Updating the firmware on your My Cloud Mirror

**Important: Make sure you stop all processes and save all your data before performing the firmware update.**

**Note:** **My Cloud devices require a hard drive inserted into the bay and a volume must be created to perform the firmware update.**
 Do not interrupt the firmware upgrade process. Doing so may cause the device to malfunction or unable to boot.
If you are using the manual update method, do not rename the firmware file. Doing so will cause the manual update to fail and can corrupt the system.

##### Updating the firmware on your My Cloud Mirror

1. Download the firmware to your desktop.
2. Unzip the file and you will find the actual firmware in this format: My\_Cloud\_BZVM\_2.xx.xx.bin
3. Save this to your desktop.
4. Open the My Cloud Mirror Dashboard UI.
5. Go to Settings >> Firmware Update.
6. Under the section Manual Update, click the Update From File button and a window will open.
7. Browse to where you saved the My\_Cloud\_BZVM\_2.xx.xx.bin file and select it.
8. You will see a pop up confirming to upgrade your firmware, click Ok.
