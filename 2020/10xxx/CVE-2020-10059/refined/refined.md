  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2020-10059",
    "description": "The UpdateHub module disables DTLS peer checking, which allows for a man in the middle attack. This is mitigated by firmware images requiring valid signatures. However, there is no benefit to using DTLS without the peer checking.",
    "affected_component": "UpdateHub module",
    "root_cause": "The UpdateHub module explicitly disables DTLS peer verification.",
    "vulnerability": "DTLS peer verification is disabled, making the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
     "impact": "A man-in-the-middle attacker can intercept and modify update communications.",
    "attack_vector": "A man-in-the-middle attack between the device and the UpdateHub server.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the device and the UpdateHub server."
