Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `/cgi-bin/ExportAllSettings.sh` script of certain Wavlink devices. This script allows a user to download the device's configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The `/cgi-bin/ExportAllSettings.sh` script can be accessed via a POST request without requiring any authentication.
*   **Insecure Encryption:** The configuration file is encrypted using OpenSSL aes-256-cbc, but the encryption/decryption key is hardcoded within the device's firmware, making it readily available.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The decrypted configuration file contains sensitive information, including the administrator's username and password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain the administrator's credentials and other sensitive device configuration information.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Potential):** As noted, the exposed credentials can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-10971) to achieve full remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A remote attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/cgi-bin/ExportAllSettings.sh` endpoint. This triggers the script to return the encrypted configuration file. The attacker then uses the hardcoded key to decrypt it and obtain the admin credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Wavlink device. This could be a local network or potentially a publicly exposed device.
*   **Basic Web Request Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to send a basic POST request to a specific URL and perform a decryption step using known information.

**Affected Devices:**

*   Wavlink WN530HG4
*   Wavlink WN531G3
*   Wavlink WN533A8
*   Wavlink WN551K1

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered an "Insecure Permission" issue due to the lack of authentication.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by James Clee, who also identified other vulnerabilities in Wavlink devices.
*   The vendor, Wavlink, did not respond to the initial vulnerability reports.
