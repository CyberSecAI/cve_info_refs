Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient argument validation within multiple syscalls of the Kscan (keyboard scan) subsystem in Zephyr RTOS. Specifically, the driver object was not being validated in some APIs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Argument Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of the driver object passed to the Kscan syscall handlers.
*   **Missing Driver Object Checks:**  The code did not verify if the provided driver object was valid before proceeding with operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:**  An attacker with code execution in userspace could potentially exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges. This is because the lack of validation allows user code to potentially call kernel functions with arbitrary driver objects.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Syscall Manipulation:** The attack vector involves exploiting the system call interface of the Kscan subsystem. A malicious actor would make crafted syscall requests.
*   **Userspace Code Execution:** The attacker needs to have achieved code execution within a user thread.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Userspace Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code within a user thread.
*   **Knowledge of Syscalls:** The attacker needs to know the specific syscalls exposed by the Kscan subsystem and how to manipulate their arguments.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix was introduced in a branch from v2.1.0 and is also present in release v2.2.0.
*   The vulnerability is also referenced as NCC-ZEP-006 in the NCC Group's security assessment report.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding validation checks for driver objects in the affected syscall handlers, as shown in the commit message "No check of the driver object was being performed for two APIs".
*   The pull request fixing the issue is [PR23748](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/23748), which was later backported.
