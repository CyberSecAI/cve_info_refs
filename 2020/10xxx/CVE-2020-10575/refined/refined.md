**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The primary vulnerability is a race condition leading to use-after-free or double-free scenarios. This stems from a broken management of sessions tied to registered usernames.
- The VideoCall plugin was not benefitting from previous fixes applied to other plugins due to its different session management approach.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation of this race condition can lead to crashes in the Janus server.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves triggering the race condition through user interaction with the VideoCall plugin, potentially by rapidly creating and destroying sessions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to interact with the Janus server using the vulnerable VideoCall plugin. The attacker needs to be able to initiate and terminate sessions quickly to trigger the race condition, indicating the attacker would likely need some form of network access to the server.
