    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Stack buffer overflow in the YAFFS file timestamp parsing logic.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack buffer overflow in `yaffsfs_istat()` function due to insufficient buffer size when calling `tsk_fs_time_to_str`.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A stack buffer overflow can lead to denial of service (crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
