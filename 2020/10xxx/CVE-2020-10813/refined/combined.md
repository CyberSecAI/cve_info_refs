FTPDMIN: Minimal ad-hoc file transfer Windows FTP server
## FTPDMIN: Simple ad-hoc file transfer Windows FTP server

Version 0.96   Jun 7 2004

Ftpdmin is a minimal Windows FTP server. FTP does not require an "install". It
is intended to be run temporarily, on an as-needed basis basis to do file transfers between
Windows computers without going thru the trouble of trying to configure windows file sharing
or an FTP server. Also useful for Windows to Linux if the Linux computer doesn't happen
to have an FTP server already set up and configured.

Ftpdmin is not intended as an internet FTP server, or
even intended to be left running. Rather, Ftpdmin is started from the command line so
that another computer can connect to it via FTP, typically over a LAN. When the file
transfers are done, stop Ftpdmin. No 'installation' is necessary to use it.

Ftpdmin has no notion of security or even passwords. Rather, once it is running, everyone
can connect to it. The only resemblance of security is the -g option (get only,
disallows put), and the ability to specify a directory that ftpdmin shall consider
the root directory.

### How to use ftpdmin

In order to use ftpdmin, you must have a LAN connection between the two computers. It
should be possible to ping either computer from the other.

On one of your computers, run ftpdmin.exe. On starting, ftpdmin will display which address
it is listening on. You can now FTP this computer from another computer. You can
use any FTP program you like, including the ones included with Windows. if you don't know
how to use FTP, you can use explorer. Simply type the address that ftpdmin displays
into your browser - such as "ftp://192.168.0.101"

When you are done transferring files, remember to stop ftpdmin.

### Ftpdmin command line options

ftpdmin [options] [root\_dir]

| -p <port> Specifies the control port. By default, it is 21, and 2100 if port 21 cannot be opened. If ports other than 21 are used, it is necessary to tell the ftp program accessing ftpdmin which port to use. This can be done from Internet explorer by typing "ftp://192.168.0.100:2100" into the URL field, for example.| -tp <port> Specifies transfer port or port range. This option is useful if you have to open ports in a firewall to allow ftpdmin to be accessed. Port range is specified as - (example: 100-109)| -ha <addr> Specifies the IP address thru which ftpdmin is to be reachable. This option only applicable when running ftpdmin behind a NAT firewall. Ip address must be in the form such as 64.23.1.2.| -g Specify 'get only'. Disallows uploads| root\_dir Specifies root directory, such as "c:\My Photos". This directory shall be considered the root directory for FTP. It will not be possible for the accessing FTP program to cd up from this directory. | | | | | | | | | |

### Compatibility

Ftpdmin has been tested on Windows 98, 2000 and XP.
It has been tested to work with various FTP clients, including the basic
command line ftp client included with Windows, ncftp, and various Unix FTP clients.
Ftpdmin has also been tested against various GUI FTP clients, including Internet Explorer,
Mozilla, gFtp (Linux), Konqueror (Linux), and Safari (Mac).

It may be necessary to configure or disable the firewall when running ftpdmin on XP with
service pack 2.
### Why I wrote this program

I used to have my laptop dual-bootable to Linux. This was really handy sometimes,
when I was visiting somebody else, and had to transfer some large files. Getting Windows
file sharing to work on somebody else's lan is usually too much hassle for transferring
just a few files. So I'd boot my laptop to Linux and do it via FTP. But that was
really the main thing I used Linux for on the laptop. Having an FTP server under
Windows would help, but setting up an FTP server is a pain - they are all so
complicated. First install it, and then you have to configure groups and users and
passwords. And then it doesn't even work right! I didn't want to set up some sophisticated
and complicated FTP server when I just need to transfer a few files.
Unable to find a truly simple but capable FTP server, I decided to write my own! This
one weighs in at about 1000 lines of C code.

### Licence

Ftpdmin is totally free. Do whatever you like with it. You can integrate it into
GPL or BSD style liscensed programs if you would like to. My only grief with
releasing software on the internet so far has been gnu fanatics posting older copy
of my software with harvestable email addresses in it and not taking those out when
I ask them - seeing that my 'liscense' doesn't forbid that, they ignored my request.
### Bugs

Ftpdmin will mess up directory handling if you connect with more than one client at a time.
Fixing this would require a fair bit of work, as ftpdmin relies on the OS's current directory
as its own directory, but the current directory is not thread local. However, the way
ftpdmin is meant to be used, this isn't really a problem.

As of October 2006, I'm still using the original version.
