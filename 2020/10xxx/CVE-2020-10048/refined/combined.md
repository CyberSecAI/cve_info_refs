SUMMARY

A vulnerability in the SIMATIC WinCC Graphics Designer tool could allow an attacker that has physical
access to a machine running the software to get access to the user’s private password-protected pictures.

Siemens has released an update for SIMATIC WinCC and recommends to update to the latest version.
Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for PCS 7 as the affected feature is not ofﬁcially
supported.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

SIMATIC PCS 7:
All versions

SIMATIC WinCC:
All versions < V7.5 SP2

See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

Update to V7.5 SP2 or later version
https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/
view/109783853/

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Tailor user privileges to each user’s speciﬁc needs (need-to-know principle)

• Limit access to the affected products by implementing strict access control mechanisms

• Speciﬁc for PCS 7:

– The affected WinCC-feature is not ofﬁcially supported and not used by PCS 7. We recommend

not to use it and apply the measures described in SIMATIC PCS 7 Compendium Part F.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SIMATIC PCS 7 is a distributed control system (DCS) integrating SIMATIC WinCC, SIMATIC Batch,
SIMATIC Route Control, OpenPCS7 and other components.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-10048

Due to an insecure password veriﬁcation process, an attacker could bypass the password protection set
on protected ﬁles, thus being granted access to the protected content, circumventing authentication.
