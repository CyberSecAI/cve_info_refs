## Security Advisory 0048 [PDF](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/10702-security-advisory-48?tmpl=component&format=pdf "PDF")

#### **Date:** May 13, 2020

#### **Version:** 1.0

| Revision | Date | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | May 13, 2020 | Initial Release |

The CVE-ID tracking this issue: CVE-2020-10188
CVSSv3 Base Score: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

#### **Description:**

This security advisory documents the exposure of Arista’s products to a security vulnerability in EOS, for customers who use Telnet in their management plane. The vulnerability is in the telnet server (telnetd) and can lead to arbitrary remote code execution by an attacker without requiring credentials.

This is not an Arista specific vulnerability. The exposure in EOS is limited to systems with the telnetd service explicitly enabled (i.e. “management telnet” enabled).

#### **Symptoms**

An attack due to this vulnerability could result in remote code execution by an unauthenticated remote attacker. There might not be any logging of the exploitation. The exposure is limited to systems with Telnet enabled.

#### **Vulnerability Assessment**

**Affected Software**

* EOS

+ 4.24.0F
+ 4.23.3M and below releases in the 4.23.x train
+ 4.22.4M and below releases in the 4.22.x train
+ 4.21.10M and below releases in the 4.21.x train
+ All releases in older code trains

**Affected Platforms**

* This is a platform-independent vulnerability and affects all systems running EOS with the versions identified above
* The following products are **not affected**:

+ Arista Wireless Access Points
+ CloudVision and the CV Servers
+ Arista 7130 Systems running MOS
+ Big Switch Nodes for BCF and BMF (Arista CCF and DMF)

**Mitigation**

As a security best practice, it is recommended to use secure alternatives instead of Telnet, which is an unencrypted protocol. EOS offers both SSH and eAPI with TLS as secure management plane protocols. If currently enabled, a prompt mitigation step to safeguard against this vulnerability is to disable Telnet on your Arista systems.

As a resolution against this vulnerability, refer to the section entitled “Resolution” for remediated software versions and hotfix details.

**Resolution**

This vulnerability is tracked by Bug 472113. If you need to use Telnet in your setup, the recommended course of action is to install the provided hotfix or upgrade to a remediated EOS version.

The vulnerability is fixed in the following EOS versions:

- 4.24.1F and later releases
- 4.23.4M and later releases
- 4.22.5M and later releases
- 4.21.11M and later releases
- 4.24.0.FX-KC

If you are unable to upgrade EOS right away, the fix is available as a hotfix and should be applied to safeguard against this vulnerability.

The hotfix can be installed as an EOS extension and is supported on all affected EOS versions under support. The current oldest supported version of EOS is 4.19.7M. The hotfix installation resets the existing telnet connections. It is non-impactful to traffic forwarding and normal switch behavior.

For instructions on installation and verification of EOS extensions, refer to this section in the EOS User Manual: [https://www.arista.com/en/um-eos/eos-section-6-7-managing-eos-extensions](/um-eos/eos-section-6-7-managing-eos-extensions). Ensure that the extension is made persistent across reboots by copying the installed-extensions to boot-extensions.

/\*  \* ttsuck - This is a horrible kludge to deal with a bug in \* HostExplorer. HostExplorer thinks it knows how to do krb5 auth, but \* it doesn't really.

So we peek ahead into the \* input stream to see if the client is a UNIX client, and then \* (later) offer krb5 first only if it is. Since no Mac/PC telnet \* clients do auto switching between krb4 and krb5 like the UNIX \* client does, it doesn't matter what order they see the choices in \* (except for HostExplorer). \* \* It is actually not possible to do this without looking ahead into \* the input stream: the client and server both try to begin \* auth/encryption negotiation as soon as possible, so if we let the \* server process things normally, it will already have sent the list \* of supported auth types before seeing the NEW-ENVIRON option. If \* you change the code to hold off sending the list of supported auth \* types until after it knows whether or not the remote side supports \* NEW-ENVIRON, then the auth negotiation and encryption negotiation \* race conditions won't interact properly, and encryption negotiation \* will reliably fail. \*/

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 9.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 9.8 |

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

### BraveStarr – A Fedora 31 netkit telnetd remote exploit

[Ronald Huizer](https://twitter.com/ronaldhuizer)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/immunityinc/bravestarr/master/assets/bravestarr.gif)

> *It’s not worth doing something unless you were doing something that someone, somewhere, would much rather you weren’t doing.*

> *Sir Terence David John Pratchett*

# 1 Introduction

In this post we will present a vulnerability in the Fedora 31 version of netkit-telnet-0.17 telnetd which has been present for a long time, and which is remotely exploitable. Other Linux distributions or Unix systems may or may not be vulnerable, however the aim of this post is to present an interesting vulnerability and corresponding [exploit](https://github.com/immunityinc/bravestarr/blob/master/bravestarr.py) and not to create a taxonomy of vulnerable versions. We will leave this to others.

The exploit presented is a proof-of-concept one: it will show a working basis that defeats the default Fedora 31 mitigations such as PIE, ASLR, and non-executable pages. The exploit will however not bypass SELinux, and further research is needed to do so. A proper exploit would also need to be far more reliable. We believe both can be done, but to reduce the amount of time spent on weaponizing a now disclosed vulnerability, and to mitigate the impact of installations that – god forbid – still run telnetd, we will also leave this to others.

# 2 Source code overview

As the vulnerability and exploitation are somewhat involved, we will discuss the telnetd code base in a manner that first provides understanding of the internals before we switch to discussing the vulnerability and expoitation. To keep this document more or less clear, not all parts of the source code have been listed here. For those who want to pursue a deeper understanding of the code, the Fedora 31 netkit-telnet-0.17 tarball is available [here](https://github.com/immunityinc/bravestarr/blob/master/assets/netkit-telnet-0.17.tgz?raw=true).

## 2.1 Glossary of important names, variables, and conventions

The telnet protocol is outlined in [RFC 854](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc854), but for readers that are not keen on reading through this document, we will summarize the most frequently used abbrevations below.

* IAC: Interpret as Command. An escape character that tells the next sequence is a command sequence rather than data.
* AO: Abort output. A command that discards further terminal output of the current running process.
* SB: Suboption Begin. A command that marks the beginning of a suboption sequence.
* SE: Suboption End. A command that marks the end of a suboption sequence.

The source code contains many global variables that are frequently used. To ease the reading burden, below the reader can find a glossary of the ones we will encounter during our discussion.

* `int net`: the client socket, which data is read from and sent to.
* `char netibuf[BUFSIZ]`: the network input buffer. Data read from the client is stored here.
* `int ncc`: the number of bytes read from the client into `netibuf`.
* `char *netip`: the network input pointer. Tracks where in `netibuf` we are processing.
* `char netobuf[BUFSIZE+NETSLOP]`: the network output buffer. Data to send to the client is stored here.
* `char *nbackp`: marks the start of unsent data in `netobuf`.
* `char *nfrontp`: marks where to add data to `netobuf`.
* `char *neturg`: marks a single byte to be sent as urgent data in `netobuf`.
* `char ptyibuf[BUFSIZ]`: the pty input buffer. Data read from the login process pty is stored here.
* `int pcc`: the number of bytes read from the pty into `ptyibuf`.
* `char *ptyip`: the pty input pointer. Tracks where in `ptyibuf` we are processing.
* `char ptyobuf[BUFSIZ+NETSLOP]`: the pty output buffer. Data to be sent to the login process pty is stored here.
* `char *pbackp`: marks the start of unsent data in `ptyobuf`.
* `char *pfrontp`: marks where to add data to `ptyobuf`.

Finally, we would like to draw attention to some conventions used throughout this document. We will denote the integer range 1,…,10 using the inclusive `[1,10]` notation, the exclusive `(0,11)` notation, or a combination of the two such as `[1,11)`.

## 2.2 The main processing loop

We’ll discuss the vulnerability in a top-down fashion, and therefore we will begin by looking at the function that drives network communication after a client connection has been accepted.

The processing of a client network request to telnetd is handled in the `ttloop` function. In spite of it being named `ttloop`, this function is in fact a single iteration over receiving and processing client data. On line [148](#ttloop-148) client input is read into `netibuf` and the number of bytes read is kept in the global `int` variable `ncc`. The current instance of the daemon will terminate immediately on [read errors](#ttloop-149) or an [EOF](#ttloop-152) from the client. If data is read `netip` is initialized to the start of `netibuf` at [157](#ttloop-157) and the main state machine `telrcv` is called at [158](#ttloop-158). Note that `telrcv` will decrement `ncc` upon consuming network input, and at [159](#ttloop-159) if there is still data remaining afterwards the pty output buffer will be reset and `telrcv` will be called again. We will see later that the only way `telrcv` returns with `ncc > 0` is if `ptyobuf` would overflow.

```
[void](#ttloop-139 "139")
[ttloop(void)](#ttloop-140 "140")
[{](#ttloop-141 "141")

 [DIAG(TD_REPORT, netoprintf("td: ttloop\r\n"););](#ttloop-143 "143")

 [if (nfrontp-nbackp) {](#ttloop-145 "145")
 [netflush();](#ttloop-146 "146")
 [}](#ttloop-147 "147")
 [ncc = read(net, netibuf, sizeof(netibuf));](#ttloop-148 "148")
 [if (ncc < 0) {](#ttloop-149 "149")
 [syslog(LOG_INFO, "ttloop: read: %m\n");](#ttloop-150 "150")
 [exit(1);](#ttloop-151 "151")
 [} else if (ncc == 0) {](#ttloop-152 "152")
 [syslog(LOG_INFO, "ttloop: peer died: EOF\n");](#ttloop-153 "153")
 [exit(1);](#ttloop-154 "154")
 [}](#ttloop-155 "155")
 [DIAG(TD_REPORT, netoprintf("td: ttloop read %d chars\r\n", ncc););](#ttloop-156 "156")
 [netip = netibuf;](#ttloop-157 "157")
 [telrcv();                   /* state machine */](#ttloop-158 "158")
 [if (ncc > 0) {](#ttloop-159 "159")
 [pfrontp = pbackp = ptyobuf;](#ttloop-160 "160")
 [telrcv();](#ttloop-161 "161")
 [}](#ttloop-162 "162")
[}  /* end of ttloop */](#ttloop-163 "163")
```
## 2.3 The main state machine

The telnetd state machine that processes network input and drives the protocol actions is defined in the `telrcv` function.

Note that the source tarball contains preprocessor conditionals for `ENCRYPT` and `LINEMODE`. These are not defined in the default Fedora 31 build, and therefore have been removed from the source code listing.

As long as we still have network input at [86](#telrcv-86), then a byte is stored in `c` at [88](#telrcv-88) and `ncc` is adjusted to reflect the consumed byte at [89](#telrcv-89). We will not discuss the entire state machine, but have mainly listed the code below to refer to in later parts of this document. For now take note of how the IAC AO sequence is handled, in particular the [`netclear`](#telrcv-194) call.

```
[void telrcv(void) {](#telrcv-82 "82")
 [register int c;](#telrcv-83 "83")

A quick overview of the `telrcv` state machine is shown below.

### 2.3.1 Option handling

An important part of the telnet protocol is option negotiation. This is done through IAC DO, IAC DONT, IAC WILL, and IAC WONT command sequences. The meaning of these sequences is as follows:

* DO: requests the peer to use a certain negotiable option.
* DONT: requests the peer to not use a certain negotiable option.
* WILL: notifies the peer we will use a certain negotiable option.
* WONT: notifies the peer we will not use a certain negotiable option.

Within the scope of our discussion, we will use only use IAC DO commands, which result in a call to [`dooption`](#telrcv-337) in the state machine. The code can be found below, and the most important thing to note is that unknown option codes will be replied to with [`send_wont`](#dooption-907) which repeats the requested option code. This means that a sequence such as IAC DO U, where U is an unknown option, will be replied to with IAC WONT U.

## 2.4 Basis of the vulnerability

The `netclear` and `nextitem` functions can scan past the end of `netobuf` and corrupt memory in the data segment under certain conditions. We will not yet discuss whether these conditions can be met, as this is complicated, but first focus on explaining the issue in these two functions.

### 2.4.1 The netclear() function

The `netclear` function, as depicted below, reworks the network output buffer `netobuf` to remove data that was already sent, as well as unwanted items. An item here is either a single data byte, or an IAC command sequence of two or more bytes. The `nextitem` function is used to partition `netobuf` into items. We will discuss the implementation of this function later.

At [277](#netclear-277) `thisitem` is set to `netobuf` and at [280](#netclear-280) items are skipped as long as they are smaller than `nbackp`. As mentioned before, `nbackp` points to the location in `netobuf` that has not already been sent over the network. Anything before `nbackp` can therefore be discarded. At [289](#netclear-289) `good` is set to `netobuf` as well. This is the destination pointer for copying `netobuf` data that is retained, so this copy will be performed inline.

At [292](#netclear-292) items will be processed from `thisitem` while it is smaller than `nfrontp`. Items that do not match the `wewant` macro will be skipped at [305](#netclear-305). An item that does match the `wewant` macro will first be coalesced to adjacent wanted items in the loop at [297](#netclear-297) and then copied back to `good` at [301](#netclear-301).

```

[}  /* end of netclear */](#netclear-312 "312")
```
### 2.4.2 The nextitem() function

The `nextitem` function is meant to find the item starting after the item pointed to by `current`.

The function performs no bounds checking, and can return pointers past the end of the region `current`. Offsets should be constrained to not extend past the end of the `current` region at [232](#nextitem-232), [246](#nextitem-246), and most notably [240](#nextitem-240). The latter over-indexation is the most dangerous one, as it means the function will keep scanning memory until it finds a IAC, SE sequence in memory and return a pointer to the byte after it.

### 2.4.3 Data segment corruption idea

Given the code discussed above, if we could get `netobuf` to contain an opening IAC SB sequence but not a closing IAC SE sequence, the `nextitem` function would scan past the end of `netobuf` to find the closing sequence. In case this sequence is not present, this would result in accessing unmapped memory and thus a segmentation fault. However, in case such a sequence exists past the end of `netobuf`, the loop at [297](#netclear-297) would terminate due to `next` being larger than `nfrontp` (which should not point past the end of `netobuf`), and result in `length` being too large. Depending on the position of `good` in `netobuf`, this can result in an out of bounds read (if `length` fits at `good` and just overindexes `thisitem`) or an out of bounds read and write (if `length` does not fit at `good`).

## 2.5 Network output buffer control

We have seen previously that we have a data segment overflow if we can create an IAC SB sequence in `netobuf` without a terminating IAC SE sequence. In order to do so, we will have to look more closely at primitives we have to control this buffer.

First we will discuss the ways in which we can have the daemon add data to the buffer and what parts of that data we control. Then we will look at how these functions work internally, and discuss how the buffer is flushed when full and how urgent data is handled. Finally we will use everything discussed so far to create an unterminated IAC SB sequence in the network output buffer.

### 2.5.1 Primitives adding data to the network output buffer

We cannot add arbitrary data to `netobuf` directly. Instead the daemon will add to it based on the network input we provided in `netibuf`. To create a situation where we have an unterminated IAC SB sequence in `netobuf`, we need to see to what extent we can control parts of the data that is added to `netobuf`.

There are several ways in which data can be added to `netobuf` in the source code. The `output_data` and `output_datalen` functions in `utility.c` can be used to do so, as well as the `netoprintf` macro in `ext.h`. Finally the location the `nfrontp` pointer refers to is directly written to in `state.c` (handling the IAC AO sequence) and `telnetd.c` (data read from the pty).

```
[#define netoprintf output_data](#ext.h-90 "90")
[int     output_data(const char *, ...) __attribute((format (printf, 1, 2)));](#ext.h-91 "91")
[void    output_datalen(const char *, int);](#ext.h-92 "92")
```

We will look at the call sites of `netoprintf`, `output_data`, and `output_datalen`. We can see the `netoprintf` macro is a simple wrapper around the `output_data` function. It is called in a lot of places in the source tree, but a lot of these places are for diagnostics. This means the build-time definition `DIAGNOSTICS` will have to be set, and telnetd itself would have to have been started with the `-D` command line option. This is not typically the case, so we will not consider such use. Below are the call-sites we identified:

`state.c`

* `send_do`, `send_dont`, `send_will`, and `send_wont`. Each of these add 3 bytes to `netobuf`, of which we control the last byte.

* IAC AO handling at in [telrcv](#telrcv-195).

`termstat.c`
Only for `LINEMODE` defined compilations. This is not the case for Fedora 31.

`telnetd.c`

* Once for every option in response to the `TELOPT_TSPEED`, `TELOPT_XDISPLOC`, `TELOPT_ENVIRON`, and `TELOPT_TTYPE` telnet options if the client supports them.

* In the `_gettermname` function if the client supports `TELOPT_TTYPE`.

* When writing the IAC DM sequence in the pty handling main loop.

* When flow control is supported by the client in the pty handling main loop.

* In the `recv_ayt` function. This is used in response to IAC AYT requests, and is interesting as it results in amplification.

`slc.c`

* In the `end_slc` function used when handling the `TELOPT_LINEMODE` option in `state.c`. This needs a `LINEMODE` defined build, which is not the case on Fedora 31.

Out of all these call sites, we have identified two that we can use for the development of the exploit in this article. We will rely on the `send_wont` call in [`dooption`](#tlercv-337) and the IAC DM addition at `nfrontp` in [`telrcv`](#telrcv-195). Note that in the latter case there is no direct check to ensure this will not access memory past the end of `netobuf`. It is possible to crash the daemon using this, but that is outside the scope of the current document. The reason we picked these two call sites will become apparent later on. For now, remember that we will use two primitives for adding data to `netobuf`, one which will add a 3 byte IAC WONT sequence and then a byte we can control - provided it is not a valid option. And one which will add a 2 byte IAC DM sequence.

With these two primitives in mind, we will further look into how output data is buffered in `netobuf` and how a shortage of buffer space is handled.

### 2.5.2 Output function internals

The `output_data` function is a simple wrapper around the `output_datalen` function that support format strings. It is listed below for completeness.

```
[int](#output_data-63 "63")
[output_data(const char *format, ...)](#output_data-64 "64")
[{](#output_data-65 "65")
 [va_list args;](#output_data-66 "66")
 [int len;](#output_data-67 "67")
 [char *buf;](#output_data-68 "68")

 [va_start(args, format);](#output_data-70 "70")
 [if ((len = vasprintf(&buf, format, args)) == -1)](#output_data-71 "71")
 [return -1;](#output_data-72 "72")
 [output_datalen(buf, len);](#output_data-73 "73")
 [va_end(args);](#output_data-74 "74")
 [free(buf);](#output_data-75 "75")
 [return (len);](#output_data-76 "76")
[}](#output_data-77 "77")
```

The `output_datalen` function itself does most of the work, and is more interesting. The source tarball shows that `netobuf` is `BUFSIZE+NETSLOP` bytes big, which is typically 8256 bytes. `nfrontp` points to the position in `netobuf` where data will be added to, so `nfrontp - netobuf` is the size of `netobuf` that is currently in use.

The while loop at [85](#output_datalen-85) will partition the input in `buf` into chunks of at most `BUFSIZE` bytes and process these chunks in order. In case there is not enough space available to copy the current chunk into `netobuf`, the `netflush` function will be called to create space at [88](#output_datalen-88), and as flushing will adjust `nfrontp` the remaining space is also recalculated.

The chunk is then copied into the network output buffer at [94](#output_datalen-94) and the related variables are updated.

```
[void](#output_datalen-79 "79")
[output_datalen(const char *buf, int len)](#output_datalen-80 "80")
[{](#output_datalen-81 "81")
 [int remaining, copied;](#output_datalen-82 "82")

 [remaining = BUFSIZ - (nfrontp - netobuf);](#output_datalen-84 "84")
 [while (len > 0) {](#output_datalen-85 "85")
 [/* Free up enough space if the room is too low*/](#output_datalen-86 "86")
 [if ((len > BUFSIZ ? BUFSIZ : len) > remaining) {](#output_datalen-87 "87")
 [netflush();](#output_datalen-88 "88")
 [remaining = BUFSIZ - (nfrontp - netobuf);](#output_datalen-89 "89")
 [}](#output_datalen-90 "90")

 [/* Copy out as much as will fit */](#output_datalen-92 "92")
 [copied = remaining > len ? len : remaining;](#output_datalen-93 "93")
 [memmove(nfrontp, buf, copied);](#output_datalen-94 "94")
 [nfrontp += copied;](#output_datalen-95 "95")
 [len -= copied;](#output_datalen-96 "96")
 [remaining -= copied;](#output_datalen-97 "97")
 [buf += copied;](#output_datalen-98 "98")
 [}](#output_datalen-99 "99")
 [return;](#output_datalen-100 "100")
[}](#output_datalen-101 "101")
```

What remains is a closer look at the `netflush` function, as this handles what happens when there is not enough buffer space available. The attentive reader may already have noticed that `remaining` at [89](#output_datalen-89) is recalculated rather than reset to `BUFSIZ`, which hints at the fact that `netflush` may not drain the network output buffer completely when called.

### 2.5.3 netflush internals

The `netflush` implementation can be found below. If there is data that has not been written yet in `netobuf` – that is, all data between `nbackp` and `nfrontp` – it will be handled in the conditional code block at [325](#netflush-325). When no urgent data has been added to the network output buffer, data starting at `nbackp` is written to the network socket – see [362](#netflush-362). The amount sent is recorded, and `nbackp` is adjusted upward to reflect this data has been sent at [376](#netflush-376). If `nfrontp` is equal to `nbackp` all data will have been drained, and the network output buffer state is reinitialized at [384](#netflush-384). Note that `netobuf` will not be fully drained if `send` returns a smaller value than was requested.

We have not yet discussed the handling of urgent data, which is done at [352](#netflush-352) if `neturg` is not `NULL`. Recall that `neturg` is a special purpose pointer within `netobuf` which marks the area of urgent data. Just as [*n**b**a**c**k**p*, *n**f**r**o**n**t**p*) is the range of network output data that is yet to be written to the network socket, [*n**b**a**c**k**p*, *n**e**t**u**r**g*) is the range of urgent data that is yet to be written to the network socket. Note that `netobuf` will not be fully drained if there is both urgent and normal data in `netobuf`, as the `send` call will only attempt to drain the urgent data.

## 2.6 Triggering the vulnerability

The methods to control `netobuf` content as described in the previous section are enough to craft a IAC SB sequence without a terminating IAC SE sequence in the content. We have several ways to make this happen, and will discuss the two most important ones. This is easiest to demonstrate by example, which we will do in the next sections.

Before doing so, we need to point out that the state machine will handle IAC DO sequences by calling [`dooption`](#telrcv-337). Without looking at the dooption code, we note that an unknown option byte will always be replied to using `send_wont` resulting in a IAC WONT reply sequence. More specifically, an input sequence such as IAC DO SB would be replied to with an IAC WONT SB sequence, and an input sequence such as IAC DO IAC would be replied to with an IAC WONT IAC sequence.

### 2.6.1 Trigger using short writes

The first way to trigger the vulnerability is by having `write` in `netflush` return before having written all data. We will discuss what happens here below in a simplified manner.

Suppose we have populated the prefix of `netobuf` with IAC WONT SB by sending IAC DO SB requests. We have then padded out the rest of the buffer up to the last byte. This leads to the following configuration:

```
 netobuf
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|     0 |     1 |     2 |  ...  |  8190 |  8191 |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|  IAC  |  WONT |   SB  |  ...  |  ...  |       |
++------+-------+-------+-------+-------++------+
 |                                       |
 +>nbackp                                +>nfrontp
```

If we send an IAC DO IAC request, a call to [`send_wont`](#dooption-907) will call `output_datalen` to add the IAC WONT IAC sequence to `netobuf`. [`netflush`](#output_datalen-88) will be called to make space for these 3 bytes. Suppose [`write`](#output_datalen-350) sends less data than requested, let’s say 2 bytes in this case, the situation then becomes:

```
 netobuf
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|     0 |     1 |     2 |  ...  |  8190 |  8191 |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|  IAC  |  WONT |   SB  |  ...  |  ...  |       |
+-------+-------++------+-------+-------++------+
                 |                       |
                 +>nbackp                +>nfrontp
```

At this point `output_datalen` would move past the `netflush` and recalculate [`remaining`](#output_datalen-89) to be 1 and [copy](#output_datalen-94) 1 byte of data to `nfrontp`. The situation after the copy is as follows:

```
 netobuf
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|     0 |     1 |     2 |  ...  |  8190 |  8191 |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|  IAC  |  WONT |   SB  |  ...  |  ...  |  IAC  |
+-------+-------++------+-------+-------+-------++
                 |                               |
                 +>nbackp                        +>nfrontp
```

As there are still 2 bytes of data to be copied by `output_datalen`, [`netflush`](#output_datalen-88) will be called again. If this time `write` will send out all remaining data, we end up with the following situation after the `netflush`:

```
 netobuf
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|     0 |     1 |     2 |  ...  |  8190 |  8191 |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|  IAC  |  WONT |   SB  |  ...  |  ...  |  IAC  |
++------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 |
 +>nfrontp
 +>nbackp
```

Finally `output_datalen` would copy the remaining 2 bytes of the IAC WONT IAC triplet, leading to:

```
 netobuf
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|     0 |     1 |     2 |  8190 |  8191 |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|  WONT |  IAC  |   SB  |  ...  |  IAC  |
++------+-------++------+-------+-------+
 |               |
 +>nbackp        +>nfrontp
```

If this buffer were to be processed by `netclear` the call to `nextitem` would skip the WONT at index 0, and start processing the IAC we injected at index 1. As `nextitem` can over-index, if the byte at index 2 is a SB byte, we would end up with the situation we desired, that is, a IAC SB sequence in netobuf without a terminating IAC SE sequence.

### 2.6.2 Trigger using urgent data

Control over the non-blocking `write` return value is complicated, because it depends on several network related factors outside our control, related variables here are the transmit buffer size, the MTU, the TCP MSS, whether or not TSO is used and so on. This situation is exacerbated by a timer telnetd will use to close the connection after a certain amount of time. We need this time to fill the remote transmit buffer, making this even more convoluted.

Thankfully, there is another way in order to have `netflush` not drain all data, which involves the use of the `neturg` pointer. The process is outlined below.

1. We start with a situation similar as before, where we have sent a IAC DO SB request. This time we follow it by an IAC AO request, and then padding requests to increase `nfrontp` to 8191. The IAC AO is answered by a IAC DM sequence as we have seen before in `telrcv` and sets `neturg` to the address of the DM byte in `netobuf`.
2. We send a IAC DO IAC request. [Remember](#telrcv-337) this will result in a call to `send_wont` producing IAC WONT IAC which ends up in `output_datalen` to add this triplet to `netobuf`. `netflush` will be called to make space for these 3 bytes. However, because `neturg` is not 0 `netflush` will now use `send` instead of `write` and [only drain 3 bytes of data](#netflush-362).
3. Now `output_datalen` will recalculate [`remaining` to be 1](#output_datalen-89), and copy 1 byte of data into `netobuf`.
4. At this point `netflush` will be called again, which will [send](#netflush-364) 1 byte of urgent data. Note that this will increase `nbackp` to `neturg` which in turn leads `neturg` to be [set to 0](#netflush-382).
5. As no space has been freed at the tail of the buffer, 0 bytes will be copied, and `netflush` will be called again. Here it will use a regular blocking `write` and drain all the remaining data.
6. The remaining WONT IAC bytes will now be written to `netobuf`, leading to the sequence WONT IAC SB at the beginning.

This is the configuration we are looking for in order to trigger the bug. The animation below illustrates the previous description:

# 3 Exploitation

Now that we have seen that we can indeed create a situation in netkit-telnetd that leads to memory corruption, we will investigate exploitability. In doing so we will develop a rudimentary proof-of-concept exploit that will spawn a root shell on a default Fedora 31 installation running netkit-telnetd. This proof of concept will not work against machines that have SELinux enabled, although we are fairly positive a working exploit can be developed against SELinux targets. We will briefly outline some ideas on this in our conclusion.

## 3.1 Copy primitive control

netkit-telnetd uses a huge number of global or file scoped variables, which includes `netobuf` which we overflow. The first issue we need to deal with is ensuring `nextitem` will find a IAC SE pair in order to survive. A tentative glance at the data section layout shows us the following sizes and names:

```
+---------+--------+-------+---------+--------+-----+-----+---------+
|    8256 |    304 |     8 |       8 |      8 |   4 |  20 |    8192 |
+---------+--------+-------+---------+--------+-----+-----+---------+
| netobuf | slctab | netip | pfrontp | neturg | net | pad | netibuf |
+---------+--------+-------+---------+--------+-----+-----+---------+
```

It seems opportune to use `netibuf` to embed the terminating IAC SE sequence. We can do this by simply sending a IAC SE pair, as [telrcv](#telrcv-153) will not add anything to `netobuf` when it encounters an unexpected command byte in `TS_IAC` state.

If this IAC SE sequence is at the start of `netibuf` and we use the buffer layout described in the previous section, we would end up copying the range `[&netobuf[1], &netibuf[1]]` to `&netbuf[0]`. This because the first WONT byte in `netobuf` will not be wanted, and `good` will point to the start of the buffer. This is a rather inflexible primitive, so the first thing we will investigate is whether we can exert any control over both the destination and the size of the copy.

### 3.1.1 Destination and size control

In order to control the destination of the copy, we need to control `good`. Respectively, to control the size of the copy we need to control at which offset in `netobuf` the IAC SE sequence occurs. Using the trigger we discussed, the WONT IAC sequence will always be written at the beginning of `netobuf`. Altough this cannot be avoided, remember that the real issue is the state desynchronization this creates by turning an IAC WONT SB sequence into a WONT IAC SB sequence.

We can propagate this state desynchronization further down `netobuf` by observing that just like we turned the IAC WONT SB sequence into WONT IAC SB we can turn the IAC WONT SB IAC WONT SB sequence into WONT IAC IAC WONT IAC SB sequence. Furthermore, this can be generalized, where we can turn a sequence with n-repetitions of IAC WONT SB into a sequence of a single WONT IAC, then (n-1) IAC WONT IAC repetitions, and finally a SB byte. Note that `good` will not be updated up until the IAC SB sequence, as the other sequences are not wanted.

This means that by adding more or fewer IAC WONT SB sequences and corresponding IAC WONT IAC sequences after desynchronization we control the position of `thisitem` within `netobuf` and also `length` in multiples of 3 at the time of the [`bcopy`](#netclear-301).

First the situation we created in `netobuf` prior to sending two IAC WONT IAC sequences.

```

```

After these two IAC WONT IAC sequences have been added to `netobuf` the situation is as below. Note that when the buffer is processed the IAC IAC sequence will be treated as data, and the IAC SB sequence will result in the condition we were looking for, but this further into `netobuf`.

```

 +>nbackp                           +>nfrontp
```
## 3.2 Limited data segment infoleak

By controlling the source and length of the copy, we can start copying from the tail of `netobuf` until and including `&netibuf[2]` to the start of `netobuf`. This range contains the data we have seen [previously](#cpc). When `netobuf` is next flushed, this copied data will be written to our client socket.

This will include the `netip` pointer, which is guaranteed to point somewhere in `netibuf`. Using this leaked pointer and the knowledge of how much data we sent ourselves, we can calculate the start address of `netibuf`. We know that `netibuf` is two pages big, and we know whether `netip` is within the first or the second page based on how much data we sent was processed at the time of the information leak. By rounding the leaked `netip` value down to a page boundary and if necessary subtracting one page, we know the exact address of `netibuf` in memory. This bypasses PIE, and allows us to determine the other addresses of variables in the data segment if we know their distance from `netibuf`.

## 3.3 Write primitive

The next thing we’re interested in is a write primitive. One of the variables we leaked was `pfrontp`, which makes a good target as controlling it allows us to [write arbitrary data](#telrcv-148) to addresses before [`&ptyobuf[BUFSIZ-2]`](#telrcv-87). This allows us to corrupt arbitrary data in the data segment, so this primitive can easily be built upon to create more flexible information leaks and write primitives.

## 3.4 Escalation of privileges

The information leak, in combination with the write primitive to the data segment we discussed have tremendous potential for finding further primitives for escalation. Many of the simpler ones are context dependent, but we have included some ideas below.

* Corrupt the `environ` pointer and add LD\_PRELOAD before login is executed. This will work well on systems where the attacker has local access.
* Target the `doopt`, `dont`, `will`, or `wont` format strings for leaking or write primitives if fortify so allows.
* Investigate more flexible write primitives and information leaks.
* Overwrite `loginprg` and aim for command injection.

## 3.5 Command injection

One of the simplest ideas is seeing if we can influence how telnetd spawns the login process and control that. There are some drawbacks to this approach, in particular SELinux allowing in.telnetd to only execute the login binary, but for a proof of concept it is suitable due to its simplicity.

Executing the login process is done using the `start_login` function as seen below. On line [629](#start_login-629) the global character pointer `loginprg` is used to determine what to execute. On the Fedora 31 build, this variable is far below `ptyobuf` on the data segment, and therefore we can write it.

The arguments passed to the command executed are not easily under our control, as they are constructed on the stack in `argv_stuff` using `addarg`. We note that on the default Fedora 31 build, what is executed use the following argv array:

```
argv[0] = loginprg;
argv[1] = "-h";
argv[2] = host;
argv[3] = "-p";
argv[4] = name;
```

Through the [USER](#start_login-668) environment variable we have easy control over `name`, although it cannot start with a hyphen (this would be a security issue by itself). This variable can be set through `TELOPT_ENVIRON` or by corrupting the `environ` variable in the data segment. We can control `host` by overflowing `remote_host_name`. The “-h” parameter in bash does not take an argument, therefore `host` can be used to pass an additional parameter to bash. A good choice in this case is “-c” which will execute the command in `name`. This is because the ‘-h’ argument passed to bash will set the `hashing_enabled` flag, and the ‘-p’ argument will set the `privileged_mode` flag. The former flag is harmless, and the latter flag suppresses bash from changing the euid, which is convenient. Indeed, executing `bash -h -c -p bash` will spawn a new shell.

### 3.5.1 Rewriting the data segment

As the data segment write primitive we have can only be used once, the easiest option is to write from `loginprg` all the way up to `remote_host_name` to get to the command execution outlined previously. This means that we will corrupt the variables on the data segment between `loginprg` and `remote_host_name` along the way. In order to avoid undesired side-effects, we have to inspect all variables we have overwritten for consistency. As this work is a proof-of-concept, we will set all memory values between `loginprg` and `remote_host_name` to 0, and have cherry-picked the ones that lead to undesired side-effects. This results in the list of values given below, where each entry will be handled specifically. Note that for more reliable exploitation we would have to exhaustively inspect all variables in this range.

```
(gdb) x/gx &loginprg
0xe0f8 <loginprg>:      0x000000000000a247
(gdb) x/wx &ptyslavefd
0xe2c8 <ptyslavefd>:    0xffffffff
(gdb) x/gx &environ
0xe700 <environ>:       0x0000000000000000
(gdb) x/gx &LastArgv
0x100c0 <LastArgv>:     0x0000000000000000
(gdb) x/64bx &remote_host_name
0x10100 <remote_host_name>:     0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00
0x10108 <remote_host_name+8>:   0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00
0x10110 <remote_host_name+16>:  0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00
0x10118 <remote_host_name+24>:  0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00
0x10120 <remote_host_name+32>:  0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00
0x10128 <remote_host_name+40>:  0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00
0x10130 <remote_host_name+48>:  0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00
0x10138 <remote_host_name+56>:  0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00    0x00
```

* loginprg: overwritten to point to the command string to execute.
* ptyslavefd: overwritten to the original value of `ptyslavefd`. If this value is incorrect, the `login_tty` function will call `fatalperror`.
* environ: overwritten to make the `getenv("USER")` call work in `start_login` as we need to control the last argument to `execv()`.
* LastArgv: overwritten to make the `setproctitle` function work.
* remote\_host\_name: overwritten with `-c\0`

One more part of this memory is used to contain a temporary scratch area that stores data we want to set pointers to. This includes the LastArgv and environ arrays, the strings inside of them, and the new value `loginprg` points to. There is not enough space to hold all the temporary data our exploit uses, but the variables that come after `state_rcsid` are not directly relevant to the code paths traversed in our exploit.

```
(gdb) x/56bx &state_rcsid
0xe140 <state_rcsid>:           0x24    0x49    0x64    0x3a    0x20    0x73    0x74    0x61
0xe148 <state_rcsid+8>:         0x74    0x65    0x2e    0x63    0x2c    0x76    0x20    0x31
0xe150 <state_rcsid+16>:        0x2e    0x31    0x32    0x20    0x31    0x39    0x39    0x39
0xe158 <state_rcsid+24>:        0x2f    0x31    0x32    0x2f    0x31    0x32    0x20    0x31
0xe160 <state_rcsid+32>:        0x39    0x3a    0x34    0x31    0x3a    0x34    0x34    0x20
0xe168 <state_rcsid+40>:        0x64    0x68    0x6f    0x6c    0x6c    0x61    0x6e    0x64
0xe170 <state_rcsid+48>:        0x20    0x45    0x78    0x70    0x20    0x24    0x00    0x00
```
# 4 Conclusion

We have presented a working exploit against Fedora 31 netkit-telnet-0.17 telnetd. Mitigations such as ASLR and PIE have been bypassed by using the bug primitive to create an information leak. Mitigations such as non-executable pages, and theoretically CFI have been bypassed by attacking metadata to change the executable that telnetd executes to log the remote user into the system.

SELinux has not been bypassed, as the current SELinux profile will not allow `in.telnetd` to execute anything else than the `login_exec_t` type. This means it is useless to change `loginprg` to anything that does not belong to this type. One idea would be to see if we can change arguments passed to `loginprg` to add a `-f` flag. Another idea is trying to gain full control over the execution path in order to pass arbitrary arguments to the `execv` call. Both of these ideas need more flexible information leaks and write primitives. We have verified at least a more flexible information leak exists that will disclose more of the data segment, but information leaks and write primitives that can write to arbitrary address in memory have not yet been pursued. We will leave this as future work to others.

Finally I would like to extend my personal gratitude to everyone that has proof-read this document and added suggestions and corrections. Most of you do not want to be named, but it should be known that your efforts were appreciated. Thank you.

   Seems to me that GNU inetutils is also affected by this issue, see e.g.

CVE ID         : CVE-2020-10188
Debian Bug     : 956084

NOTE: This DLA was intially sent on 2020-04-14 but for reasons unknown
failed to reach the mailing list.  It is being re-sent now to ensure
that it appears in the mailing list archive.  No new version of
inetutils has been published since version 2:1.9.2.39.3a460-3+deb8u1
described in the original advisory.

A vulnerability was discovered in the telnetd component of inetutils, a
collection of network utilities.  Execution of arbitrary remote code was
possible through short writes or urgent data.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
2:1.9.2.39.3a460-3+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your inetutils packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 391 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2765149.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (���First Fixed���). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.\r\n\r\nCustomers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release���for example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.13.8S:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search."

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryTelnet Vulnerability Affecting Cisco Products: June 2020 High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-telnetd-EFJrEzPx  First Published: 2020 June 24 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2020 July 8 16:58 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Interim](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#interim)   Workarounds:  [Yes](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvu66723](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu66723)     CVE-2020-10188     CWE-120       CVSS Score: [Base 9.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2020-10188     CWE-120       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-telnetd-EFJrEzPx/csaf/cisco-sa-telnetd-EFJrEzPx.json)   Email      Summary  * On February 28, 2020, APPGATE published a blog post regarding CVE-ID CVE-2020-10188, which is a vulnerability in Telnet servers (telnetd).  For more information about this vulnerability, see the [Details](#details) section.  Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-telnetd-EFJrEzPx>  Affected Products  * Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products may be affected by this vulnerability. The Vulnerable Products section includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.    Vulnerable Products The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.       | Product | Cisco Bug ID | [Fixed Release Availability](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Cisco IOS XE Software when persistent Telnet is configured | [CSCvu66723](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu66723) | Consult the Cisco Software Checker for details. |      Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Cisco IOS XE Software is affected only if the device is configured with the persistent Telnet feature. The Telnet service that is used for VTY lines in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software is not affected.  **Determine the Status of Persistent Telnet**  To determine whether the persistent Telnet feature is enabled for a device, log in to the device and use the **show running-config | include transport type persistent telnet** command in the CLI to check for the presence of the **transport type persistent telnet input**  command in the global configuration. If the command returns no output or an error message, then persistent Telnet is not configured and the device is not vulnerable.  Proof of concept code that is currently available results in high CPU usage on the affected device. To recover the device, a power cycle needs to occur.  Indicators of Compromise  * The [Cisco Security Indicators of Compromise Reference Guide](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/iocs.html "Cisco Security Indicators of Compromise Reference Guide") lists commonly observed indicators of compromise (IoCs), which can help identify devices that may have been impacted by the vulnerability that is disclosed in this advisory.  ```   Router#show processes cpu platform sorted | include telnetd  5827    5714     99%     14%     14%  R        193015808  in.telnetd  5713    5600     99%     14%     14%  R        196431872  in.telnetd  5599    5486     99%     15%     15%  R        194543616  in.telnetd  5485    5372     99%     15%     15%  R        207822848  in.telnetd  5371    5258     99%     15%     15%  R        209567744  in.telnetd  5257    5144     99%     15%     15%  R        209879040  in.telnetd   ```  Workarounds  * Disable the persistent Telnet feature and use persistent Secure Shell (SSH) instead. For more information, see the [Console Port, Telnet, and SSH Handling](https://content.cisco.com/chapter.sjs?uri=/searchable/chapter/content/en/us/td/docs/routers/access/4400/software/configuration/xe-16-11/isr4400swcfg-xe-16-11-book/console_port_telnet_and_ssh_handling.html.xml&platform=Cisco%204000%20Series%20Integrated%20Services%20Routers) configuration guide.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.  Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.13.8S**:     By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search.  Recommendations  * Telnet is an insecure protocol. Customers are advised to instead use SSH or HTTPS on Cisco products that support them.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is aware that proof-of-concept exploit code is available for the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.  The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1811673#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2020-03-09 14:14:20 UTC  ``` utility.c in telnetd in netkit telnet through 0.17 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via short writes or urgent data, because of a buffer overflow involving the netclear and nextitem functions.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1811673#c2)  Doran Moppert    2020-03-18 01:20:43 UTC  ``` Statement:  This vulnerability exists in the `telnet-server` package, not in the `telnet` client-side package. For a Red Hat Enterprise Linux host to be vulnerable, it must have telnet-server installed and the telnetd service enabled.  Use of telnetd is not recommended, as it is an un-encrypted protocol with cleartext transmission of passwords; alternatives such as openssh are preferred.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1811673#c4)  Doran Moppert    2020-03-18 01:25:51 UTC  ``` Created telnet tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1814478](show_bug.cgi?id=1814478 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-10188 telnet: telnet-server: Arbitrary remote code execution in utility.c via short writes or urgent data [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1811673#c13)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-19 18:30:28 UTC  ``` Function nextitem() in utility.c does not check the bounds of the current pointer before reading data, so it could read data that should not be read (e.g. bytes after the netobuf buffer or simply after the nbackp pointer, which indicates the first byte that needs to be sent to the client). This flaw can be used to trick nextitem() into reading escape characters carefully constructed by an attacker, allowing him to leak data and execute arbitrary code on the system. As the flaw allows to leak memory bytes from the telnet server it is possible to bypass protections as ASLR/PIE.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1811673#c14)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-20 14:41:34 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  When in enforcing mode, SELinux as configured in Red Hat Enterprise Linux provides some mitigation against an exploit for telnet-server, because it limits the kind of operations it can perform and programs that can be run from the telnet-server's context.   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1811673#c28)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-27 11:22:40 UTC  ``` This flaw can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute code on the telnet server's machine.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1811673#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-06 08:24:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:1318 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1318](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1318)   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1811673#c30)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-04-06 10:32:19 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
