  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2020-10648",
    "description": "U-Boot's verified boot feature, used to ensure only authentic software is allowed to run, does not verify that the contents of 'hashed-nodes' correlate with the sub-images required to be loaded by the configuration. This allows an attacker with a properly signed FIT image to craft arbitrary FIT images that will pass signature validation, resulting in the execution of untrusted code.",
    "root_cause": "U-Boot does not verify the contents of `hashed-nodes` correlate with the sub-images required to be loaded by the configuration.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of signed images"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass verified boot restrictions and execute untrusted code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious FIT image using a valid signed image as a base."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "An attacker needs a properly signed FIT image.",
      "Ability to modify the `default` property of the `configurations` node to force the crafted configuration to be selected during boot, or the system must not explicitly choose a specific configuration."
