- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Phoenix Contact application 'PC WORX SRT' is installed as a service with insecure permissions on its installation path. This allows any unprivileged user to write arbitrary files to the installation directory, where configuration files and binaries of the service are located.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269). Specifically, insecure default file path permissions allow any local user to write to the installation directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user can replace the legitimate 'PC WORX SRT' service binary with a rogue binary. Upon execution, the rogue binary will run with SYSTEM privileges, allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required. An attacker must have the ability to write files to the installation directory of the PC WORX SRT application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the machine with the vulnerable software installed and be able to write to the application's installation directory.
