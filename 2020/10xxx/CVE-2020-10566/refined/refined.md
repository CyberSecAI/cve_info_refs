Based on the provided commit log, this content is related to CVE-2020-10566.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The GRUB2 bootloader, when used in the `grub2-bhyve` context, was designed to operate in a trusted environment. However, `grub2-bhyve` runs in the host context while interpreting commands from a guest's `grub2.cfg`. This creates a security vulnerability where a malicious guest could exploit GRUB2 commands. Specifically:
  - The font-loading mechanism had a buffer overflow vulnerability.
  - The `read`, `write`, `in`, and `out` commands allowed reading and writing to arbitrary memory addresses, potentially including host memory and I/O ports.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow vulnerability existed in the font loading code.
*   **Arbitrary Memory Access:** The `read` and `write` commands allowed arbitrary memory access.
*   **Arbitrary I/O Port Access:** The `in` and `out` commands allowed access to arbitrary I/O ports.

**Impact of exploitation:**

A malicious guest could leverage these vulnerabilities to:
*   Escalate privileges to the host.
*   Read or modify arbitrary memory locations in the host system.
*   Read and write arbitrary I/O ports on the host system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Maliciously crafted `grub2.cfg` files from the guest OS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control or modify the `grub2.cfg` file used by `grub2-bhyve` when booting the guest OS. This implies the attacker has some level of control over the guest OS.

**Mitigation:**

The patch neutralizes the following:
*   The font-loading command is disabled to prevent the buffer overflow.
*   The `read`, `write`, `in`, and `out` commands are disabled to prevent arbitrary memory and I/O access.
