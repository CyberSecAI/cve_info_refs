Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-10698:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in Ansible Tower. It does not properly restrict WebSocket group subscriptions, allowing unauthorized users to intercept job output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation or authorization when users subscribe to WebSocket groups related to job execution.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to the disclosure of sensitive information via job stdout streams.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Normal users can potentially access the standard output (stdout) of jobs that are running in different organizations. This could leak sensitive data, though the document notes that critical data should be protected by the `no_log` flag when debugging is enabled.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **WebSocket Subscription:** The attack vector involves a normal user improperly subscribing to WebSocket groups associated with jobs running in other organizations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Normal User Access:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials within the Ansible Tower system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Ansible Tower system, presumably over a network.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Ansible Tower versions 3.4.5, 3.5.5, 3.6.3 and prior versions are affected.
*   **Mitigation:**  Disabling the `/websocket` location in Nginx can mitigate the issue but also disables job output functionality for all users.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in Ansible Tower versions 3.6.4, 3.5.6, and 3.4.6
*  **AWX:** The related fix in AWX can be found at <https://github.com/ansible/awx/pull/6465>
