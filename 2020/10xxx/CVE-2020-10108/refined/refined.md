Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-10108:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of multiple `Content-Length` headers in HTTP requests within the Twisted framework's web server. Specifically, the server ignores the first `Content-Length` header and only considers the last one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **HTTP Request Splitting:** When presented with two `Content-Length` headers, the Twisted web server ignores the first one. If the second `Content-Length` header is set to zero, the server interprets the remainder of the request body as a new, pipelined HTTP request. This behavior violates RFC 7230 Section 3.3.3, which mandates that a server reject a request with multiple `Content-Length` headers having different values.
- **Incorrect Header Parsing**: The `headerReceived()` function in `http.py` does not verify if a `Content-Length` header has already been processed, which leads to the server only using the last declared header, potentially ignoring the first.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **HTTP Request Smuggling:** An attacker can craft malicious HTTP requests that exploit the vulnerability. By sending a request with two `Content-Length` headers, they can cause the Twisted web server to misinterpret the request and treat part of the intended request body as a separate, pipelined request.
- **Cache Poisoning, Session Hijacking, Security Filter Bypasses**: The vulnerability could be leveraged for cache poisoning attacks, session hijacking via socket poisoning, and security filter bypasses, depending on the deployment context and infrastructure of the Twisted service.
- **Variable Impact:** The severity of the impact is highly contextual, depending on the role of Twisted in the environment (e.g., if used as a front-end proxy, back-end server, or within specific application logic).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Exploitation:** The attack is performed by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable Twisted server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker requires the ability to send network requests to the vulnerable Twisted web server.
- **Crafted Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests containing two `Content-Length` headers, with the second one being set to zero.

**Additional Information from the Provided Content:**

- The vulnerability is present in Twisted versions up to 19.10.0.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Twisted version 20.3.0.
- The vulnerability is described as "high" risk.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a request with two `Content-Length` headers, the first having an arbitrary value and the second one with the value of zero. This will cause the server to interpret the request body as another, new request, therefore a smuggled HTTP request.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated in certain contexts by ensuring that each request on a front-end component is sent over a separate network connection. However, this is not a complete solution.
- The flaw affects both when Twisted is used as a back-end and as a front-end server.
