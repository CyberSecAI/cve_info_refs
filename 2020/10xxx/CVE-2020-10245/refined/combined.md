3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

The CODESYS web server is used by the CODESYS WebVisu to display CODESYS visualization screens in a
web browser. Specific crafted requests may cause a heap-based buffer overflow. Further on this could crash the
web server, lead to a denial-of-service condition or may be utilized for remote code execution. As the webserver
is part of the CODESYS runtime system, this may result in unforeseen behavior of the complete runtime
system.

3.2  Exploitability

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].

# CODESYS V3 Unauthenticated Remote Heap Overflow

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

A heap overflow vulnerability exists in CmpWebServerHandlerV3.dll (file version 3.5.15.20) due to improper validation of user-supplied data sent to the CODESYS V3 web server URL endpoint /WebVisuV3.

The flaw is due to the fact that the MemGCGetSize function adds 0x5c bytes to the requested allocation size during memory allocation operation:

```

__wibu00:004BF8C0 MemGCGetSize proc near             ; CODE XREF: SysMemAllocCode+39↓p
__wibu00:004BF8C0                                    ; SysMemAllocData+1B↓p
__wibu00:004BF8C0                                    ; SysMemReallocData+3C↓p
__wibu00:004BF8C0                                    ; DATA XREF: __wibu01:00813B28↓o
__wibu00:004BF8C0
__wibu00:004BF8C0 arg_size  = dword ptr  8
__wibu00:004BF8C0
__wibu00:004BF8C0           push    ebp
__wibu00:004BF8C1           mov     ebp, esp
__wibu00:004BF8C3           mov     eax, [ebp+arg_size]; attacker-controlled
__wibu00:004BF8C6           add     eax, 5Ch ; '\'   ; int32 overflow!
__wibu00:004BF8C6                                    ; i.e., size can be 0xffffffff
__wibu00:004BF8C9           pop     ebp
__wibu00:004BF8CA           retn
__wibu00:004BF8CA MemGCGetSize endp

```

The extra 0x5c bytes appears to be used for memory garbage collection purposes. The MemGCGetSize function is called within the SysMemAllocData function, which is used by many CODESYS components to allocate memory from the heap.

An unauthenticated, remote attacker can request a very large memory allocation size (i.e., 0xffffffff) via a WEB\_CLIENT\_OPENCONNECTION message sent to the CmpWebServerHandlerV3 component:

```

|foo|-1|true|

```

The CmpWebServerHandlerV3 component (when in state 0) attempts to allocate -1 (0xffffffff) bytes for the communication buffer. When the SysMemAllocData function is called, the memory allocation size gets overflowed and a small (0xffffffff + 0x5c = 0x5b) heap buffer is actually allocated.

The attacker then sends a WEB\_CLIENT\_RUN\_SERVICE message to overflow the small communication buffer:

```

.text:100039F4           call    HandleVisuService
.text:100039FA           add     esp, 14h
.text:100039FD           mov     [ebp+err], eax
.text:10003A00           cmp     [ebp+err], 0
.text:10003A04           jnz     short err_10003A54
.text:10003A06           mov     ecx, [ebp+HdrSizePlus4] ; attacker-controlled
.text:10003A09           push    ecx
.text:10003A0A           mov     edx, [ebp+pbLayer7] ; attacker-controlled
.text:10003A0D           push    edx
.text:10003A0E           mov     eax, [ebp+cbCommBuf2] ; ffffffff
.text:10003A11           push    eax
.text:10003A12           mov     ecx, [ebp+pbCommBuf2] ; very small buf => heap buf overflow!
.text:10003A15           push    ecx
.text:10003A16           call    CMUtlSafeMemCpy

```

The following windbg output shows 0x4014 bytes of attacker-controlled data is being copied to a 0x3-byte (0x5b - (0x0028c3d8 - 0x0028c380) = 3) user buffer on the heap:

```

CmpWebServerHandlerV3!ComponentEntry+0x1d66:
*** ERROR: Symbol file could not be found.  Defaulted to export symbols for C:\Program Files\CODESYS 3.5.15.20\GatewayPLC\CODESYSControlService.exe -

        0028c378 000d 0000  [00]   0028c380    0005b - (busy)

```

The attached PoC can be used to terminate a 32-bit CODESYSControlService.exe:

```

   python codesys_v3_webserver_int32_overflow.py  8080

```

Note that when running the PoC, it's important that the CmpWebServerHandlerV3 component must be in 'state' 0. When CODESYSControlService.exe starts, CmpWebServerHandlerV3 is in state 0.

### Solution

Upgrade to V3.5.15.40.
