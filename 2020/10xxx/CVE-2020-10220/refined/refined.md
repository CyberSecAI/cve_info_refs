Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-10220

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `commands.inc.php` file of rConfig version 3.9. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input used in a SQL query within the `search` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-controlled input within the `search` parameter. Specifically the `search` parameter in `/commands.inc.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database. This includes:
  - Database name
  - User credentials (usernames, IDs, and password hashes)
  - Device information (device names, IP addresses, usernames, passwords, enable passwords)
- **Potentially Further Compromise:** By obtaining credentials and potentially other sensitive information, an attacker may be able to gain unauthorized access to the rConfig system, and potentially other systems depending on password reuse and other factors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted GET request to the vulnerable `commands.inc.php` page.
- **Manipulated `search` Parameter:** The primary attack vector involves injecting SQL code into the `search` parameter within the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the rConfig server.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests and URL parameters to craft the exploit.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the application.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit code demonstrates how an attacker would exploit this vulnerability:
1. **Target Identification:** The exploit takes the target URL as an argument (e.g., `https://target`).
2. **Vulnerable Page and Parameters:** It constructs a URL that includes the vulnerable page (`/commands.inc.php`) and vulnerable parameters (`searchOption=contains&searchField=vuln&search=search&searchColumn=command`).
3. **SQL Injection Payloads:**  The exploit constructs SQL injection payloads within the `search` parameter using `UNION ALL SELECT` statements. These payloads are designed to:
    - Extract the database name using `database()`.
    - Extract usernames, IDs, and password hashes from the `users` table.
    - Extract device names, IP addresses, usernames, passwords, and enable passwords from the `nodes` table.
4. **Data Extraction:** The exploit sends HTTP GET requests with the crafted SQL injection payloads and extracts the data returned by the application.
5.  **Data Exfiltration:** The extracted data is then printed to the console.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit code uses a custom delimiter `[PWN]` to extract the output from the responses, indicating that the application echoes the query result within HTML.
- The exploit uses `requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings(InsecureRequestWarning)` which means that it disables SSL certificate verification, making it easy to test against self signed instances.
- The exploit code demonstrates extraction of only the first 10 users and devices, but this can be easily modified to dump all database records.
- The exploit code provided demonstrates the retrieval of usernames, ids, password hashes and other sensitive information, it can also be used to modify data with the appropriate SQL injection payloads.
