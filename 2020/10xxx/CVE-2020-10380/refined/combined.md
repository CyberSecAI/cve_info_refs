# Version 0.10

* New maintainer: Jeroen Ooms
* Internal changes to support static linking on Windows; this means that
  windows a binary is now available on CRAN.
* The following internal functions are no longer exported: please
  use the corresponding DBI generic instead:

  `mysqlInitDriver`, `mysqlCloseDriver`, `mysqlDescribeDriver`,
  `mysqlDriverInfo`, `mysqlNewConnection`, `mysqlCloneConnection`,
  `mysqlDescribeConnection`, `mysqlConnectionInfo`, `mysqlCloseConnection`,
  `mysqlExecStatement`, `mysqlQuickSQL`, `mysqlDBApply`, `mysqlFetch`,
  `mysqlResultInfo`, `mysqlDescribeResult`, `mysqlDescribeFields`,
  `mysqlCloseResult`, `mysqlImportFile`, `mysqlReadTable`, `mysqlWriteTable`,
  `mysqlEscapeStrings`, `mysqlDataType`, `safe.write`.
* RMySQL gains transaction support with `dbBegin()`, `dbCommit()`,
  and `dbRollback()`, but note that MySQL does not allow data definition
  language statements to be rolled back.
* The MySQLObject base class has been removed - there is no real shared
  behaviour for MySQLDriver, MySQLConnection and MySQLResult so this
  simplifies the code
* Implemented methods for `dbIsValid()`; please use these instead of
  `isIdCurrent()`.
* Implement `dbFetch()` method; please use this in preference to `fetch()`.
  `dbFetch()` now returns a 0-row data frame (instead of an 0-col data frame)
  if there are no results.
* Methods no longer automatically close open result sets. This was implemented
  inconsistently in a handful of places.
* `dbBuildTableDefinition()` has been renamed to `mysqlBuildTableDefinition()`.
* `dbWriteTable()` has been rewritten:

  + It quotes field names using `dbQuoteIdentifier()`, rather
    than use a flawed black-list based approach with name munging.
  + It now throws errors on failure, rather than returning FALSE.
  + It will automatically add row names only if they are character, not integer.
  + When loading a file from disk, `dbWriteTable()` will no longer
    attempt to guess the correct values for `row.names` and `header` - instead
    supply them explicitly if the defaults are incorrect.
  + When given a zero-row data frame it will just creates the table
    definition.
* Assorted fixes accumulated since last release 3 years ago.
* `MySQL()` no longer has `force.reload` argument - it's not obvious that
  this ever worked.
