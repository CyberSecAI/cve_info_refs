Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10736:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from inadequate authorization checks in the `ceph-mon` and `ceph-mgr` daemons. Specifically:

*   **ceph-mon:** The `handle_command()` function had a "kludge" for older clients that allowed any authenticated client to access three whitelisted commands, regardless of their actual permissions. This could be abused by an attacker with "mon r" (read-only) capabilities to, for instance, modify configuration parameters using `injectargs`.
*   **ceph-mgr:** In `handle_command(MCommand)`, messages were queued to the adminsocket without performing access control checks if an fsid was present. This allowed an attacker, even without manager capabilities, to execute any `MCommand`, including potentially dangerous commands like `config set`, thus being able to modify the configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:**  The core issue is a failure to properly enforce access control, allowing unauthorized clients to execute privileged commands.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `ceph-mgr` daemon lacked proper checks before queuing commands to the admin socket.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Configuration Modification:** Attackers could change the cluster's configuration, potentially leading to instability or further attacks.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  An attacker with minimal permissions could gain the ability to execute arbitrary commands, potentially gaining full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network, requiring the attacker to be able to communicate with the `ceph-mon` and `ceph-mgr` daemons.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have a valid Ceph authentication credential, however, not the one requiring privileged access to execute these commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Ceph Client:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated Ceph client (with a valid keyring).
*   **Network Reachability:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the Ceph monitor (`ceph-mon`) and manager (`ceph-mgr`) daemons.
*   **Minimal Permissions:** The vulnerability can be exploited even with low-level permissions, such as the "mon r" cap, or without specific manager caps, to then escalate.

**Additional Information from Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:**  Ceph versions 15.2.0 and later are affected.
*   **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in Ceph version 15.2.2.
*   **Upstream Patches:**
    *   [master](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/c7e7009a690621aacd4ac2c70c6469f25d692868)
    *   [v15.2.2](https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/f2cf2ce1bd9a86462510a7a12afa4e528b615df2)

*   **Mitigation:**  The provided content indicates that there was no suitable mitigation available prior to the fix.
*   **Red Hat Products:** The Red Hat bugzilla entry states that "Red Hat Ceph Storage" and "Red Hat OpenStack Platform" do not ship the flawed versions and are therefore not affected.

In summary, CVE-2020-10736 is an authorization bypass vulnerability in Ceph that allows an attacker with minimal access to gain configuration modification rights by exploiting flaws in `ceph-mon` and `ceph-mgr` daemons, which has been resolved in version 15.2.2.
