- **Root cause:** The access tokens for the REST API are directly derived (sha256 and base64 encoding) from the publicly available default credentials from the Control Dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    - Insecure derivation of access tokens from default credentials.
    - Lack of proper authorization checks on the REST API.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker connected to the robot's network (wired or wireless) can exfiltrate all stored data (e.g., indoor mapping images) and associated metadata from the robot's database.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the robot's network (wired or wireless).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be connected to the robot network (either wired or wireless) and needs to have knowledge of default credentials or the ability to derive access tokens. The attacker exploits the REST API to exfiltrate data.
