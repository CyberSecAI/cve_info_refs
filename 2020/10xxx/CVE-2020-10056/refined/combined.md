## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens has released an updated version ([v2.4](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109479834/release-of-lmu-v2-4-815?dti=0&lc=en-US)) of LMU, and recommends users install this update on all affected systems.

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:

* Apply security hardening of the Windows Server, where LMU is installed on, in accordance with corporate security policies or up-to-date hardening guidelines.
* Ensure only trusted persons have access to the system and avoid the configuration of additional local accounts on the server.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends protecting network access to affected products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

For more information please see Siemens Advisory: [SSA-709003](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/services/cert.html#SecurityPublications)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply security hardening of the Windows Server, where LMU is installed on, in accordance with

your corporate security policies or up-to-date hardening guidelines

• Ensure that only trusted persons have access to the system and avoid the conﬁguration of additional

local accounts on the server

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

License Management Utiliy (LMU) is the uniﬁed license management system for Siemens’ building
automation products such as Desigo CC and ABT.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-10056

The lmgrd service of the affected application is executed with local SYSTEM privileges on the server
while its conﬁguration can be modiﬁed by local users.

The vulnerability could allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the
server with local SYSTEM privileges.
