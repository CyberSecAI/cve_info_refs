Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-10056

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Siemens License Management Utility (LMU) executing its `lmgrd` service with local SYSTEM privileges while its configuration can be modified by local users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250):** A service within the LMU application runs with SYSTEM privileges, which are not required for its functionality, and its configuration is modifiable by local users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary commands on the server with local SYSTEM privileges. This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attack requires a local user to access the server where LMU is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory notes that the vulnerability is exploitable with a low skill level.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Products:** All versions of Siemens LMU prior to v2.4 are affected.
*   **Mitigation:** Siemens released LMU v2.4 which addresses the vulnerability. They also suggest hardening the Windows server where LMU is installed, limiting access to the system and avoiding additional local accounts.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8, with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.
*   **Exploitability:** There are no known public exploits and this vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely.
*   **Reporting:** The vulnerability was reported by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).
