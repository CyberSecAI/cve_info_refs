  "CVE-2020-10135": {
    "description": "Legacy pairing and secure-connections pairing authentication in BluetoothÂ® BR/EDR Core Specification v5.2 and earlier may have allowed an unauthenticated user to complete authentication without pairing credentials via adjacent access. An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker could impersonate a Bluetooth BR/EDR master or slave to pair with a previously paired remote device to successfully complete the authentication procedure without knowing the link key.",
    "affected_versions": "Bluetooth BR/EDR Core Specification v5.2 and earlier",
    "root_cause": "The BIAS method is able to be performed for the following reasons: Bluetooth secure connection establishment is not encrypted and the selection of secure connections pairing method is not enforced for an already established pairing, Legacy Secure Connections secure connection establishment does not require mutual authentication, a Bluetooth device can perform a role switch any time after baseband paging, and devices who paired using Secure Connections can use Legacy Secure Connections during secure connection establishment.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
      "Unencrypted Bluetooth secure connection establishment.",
      "Lack of enforcement of secure connections pairing method for already established pairings.",
      "Lack of mutual authentication in Legacy Secure Connections.",
       "Bluetooth devices can perform a role switch any time after baseband paging.",
      "Devices paired using Secure Connections can use Legacy Secure Connections during secure connection establishment."
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker could impersonate a Bluetooth BR/EDR master or slave to pair with a previously paired remote device to successfully complete the authentication procedure without knowing the link key. The BIAS attack could be combined with the Key Negotiation of Bluetooth (KNOB) attack to \"impersonate a Bluetooth device, complete authentication without possessing the link key, negotiate a session key with low entropy, establish a secure connection, and brute force the session key\". An attacker could initiate a KNOB attack on encryption key strength without intervening in an ongoing pairing procedure through an injection attack. If the accompanying KNOB attack is successful, an attacker may gain full access as the remote paired device. If the KNOB attack is unsuccessful, the attacker will not be able to establish an encrypted link but may still appear authenticated to the host.",
    "attack_vector": "Adjacent Network",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker with knowledge of the remote device's Bluetooth address."
