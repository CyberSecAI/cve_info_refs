Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10733:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from `www.postgresql.org` specifically mentions `CVE-2020-10733` as: "Windows installer runs executables from uncontrolled directories." This aligns perfectly with the official CVE description, which concerns a vulnerability in the PostgreSQL Windows installer. The NetApp advisory also confirms that the identified issue refers to the vulnerability in the PostgreSQL Windows installer.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in how the PostgreSQL Windows installer invokes system-provided executables. The installer does not use fully qualified paths for these executables. This leads to a situation where if an attacker can introduce their own malicious executables into the directory where the installer runs or in the current working directory, these malicious executables may be executed instead of the intended system executables with administrative rights, because the directory where the installer runs and the current working directory takes precedence in the search path, over system directories.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Search Path:** The installer's reliance on the current working directory and the installer's directory as search paths creates a vulnerability.
*  **Lack of Fully Qualified Paths:** The installer does not use fully qualified paths when invoking system executables.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to:
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with administrative rights by replacing a legitimate system executable with a malicious one.
*   **Sensitive information disclosure, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS):**  The NetApp advisory mentions these potential impacts, indicating a wide range of exploitable outcomes.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker must have some access to the Windows system where the PostgreSQL installer is being executed.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to add files into either the directory where the installer loads, or the current working directory.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the Windows system.
*   **File System Modification:** The attacker must have the ability to add files to the directory where the installer is executed, or the current working directory.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction, where a user runs the vulnerable installer, is required

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The PostgreSQL project acknowledges Hou JingYi (@hjy79425575) for reporting this issue.
*   The vulnerability affects PostgreSQL versions from 9.5 to 12. However, the security team does not test unsupported versions and note that this issue existed before 9.5.
*  The NetApp advisory states that this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.3 (HIGH) and a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

In summary, CVE-2020-10733 is a security issue in the PostgreSQL Windows installer arising from the lack of fully qualified path specifications when executing system-provided executables, which allows attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution through local file manipulation and user interaction.
