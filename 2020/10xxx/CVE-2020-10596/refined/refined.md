Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-10596 (based on the provided context that this issue is related to the CVE)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied file names during image upload in the Opencart admin panel. Specifically, the system fails to prevent the use of malicious HTML/JavaScript code within filenames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the filename during image upload, and this code is then stored in the system.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system doesn't properly sanitize or escape HTML tags and special characters in the filename, allowing the embedded code to be executed by the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:**  The injected JavaScript code will execute whenever the affected page is loaded. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities.
- **Sensitive Data Theft:** The attacker can potentially steal sensitive information such as user cookies, keystrokes, and other account information.
- **Account Compromise:**  Through stolen cookies or other data, attackers may gain unauthorized access to administrator accounts.
- **Persistent Attack:** The XSS is stored, meaning the attack persists and affects all users who access the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Image Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious image with an XSS payload embedded in the filename through the admin panel's user profile image upload feature.
- **Admin Panel Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the Opencart admin panel and user management section to perform the upload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Admin User:** The attacker must have valid administrator-level credentials to access the admin panel and user management to upload the file.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability allows an authenticated administrator to inject persistent XSS by uploading an image with a malicious file name, allowing attackers to compromise admin accounts by stealing sensitive information.

**Additional details:**
- The reported version is Opencart 3.0.3.2
- The file name is not sanitized in the file upload process
- The vulnerability is demonstrated by using the payload: *"><svg onload=alert("XSS")>*.
