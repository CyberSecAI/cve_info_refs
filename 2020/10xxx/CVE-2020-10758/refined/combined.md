The issue occurs when there is no load balancer in place.  - Proper tuning of HTTP request timeout and keycloak database max pool size can mitigate this issue : bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --commands='/subsystem=transactions:write-attribute(name=default-timeout,value=30),/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/http-listener=default/:write-attribute(name=read-timeout,value=30000),/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/https-listener=https/:write-attribute(name=read-timeout,value=30000),/subsystem=datasources/data-source=KeycloakDS/:write-attribute(name=max-pool-size,value=100),reload'   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1843849#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-08-18 16:23:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.4 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2020:3495 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3495](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A3495)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1843849#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-08-18 16:23:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.4 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2020:3496 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3496](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A3496)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1843849#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-08-18 16:24:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.4 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2020:3497 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3497](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A3497)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1843849#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-08-18 16:35:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.4.2  Via RHSA-2020:3501 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3501](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A3501)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1843849#c16)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-08-18 21:15:28 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
