Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from Keycloak's handling of HTTP requests where the `Content-Length` header specifies a value greater than the actual size of the request body. Sending multiple such requests simultaneously leads to a denial-of-service condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** Keycloak doesn't properly validate the `Content-Length` header against the actual size of the request body, allowing for discrepancies that can be exploited.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Sending multiple requests with invalid `Content-Length` headers causes the server to allocate resources, which, when done concurrently, can lead to exhaustion, resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the Keycloak server to become unresponsive, making it unavailable to legitimate users. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed by sending specially crafted HTTP requests over the network to the Keycloak server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the Keycloak server.
*   **Ability to Forge HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to craft HTTP requests with a `Content-Length` header that exceeds the actual request body size.
*   **Simultaneous Connections:** The attacker must be able to send multiple requests concurrently.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is more easily exploited if there is no load balancer or reverse proxy in place. The issue can also be mitigated by proper tuning of HTTP request timeout and keycloak database max pool size. Specifically, setting `read-timeout` for HTTP and HTTPS listeners and `max-pool-size` for the Keycloak datasource to appropriate values can help.
*   **Fix:** The issue has been addressed in Keycloak version 11.0.1.
*   **Red Hat Errata:** The fix for this issue has been released in several Red Hat Security Advisories: RHSA-2020:3495, RHSA-2020:3496, RHSA-2020:3497, RHSA-2020:3501 and RHSA-2020:3539.
*   **Configuration Changes:** The fix also includes changes to the default settings for HTTP/HTTPS listener read-timeout (set to 30000 ms) and max-pool-size for the KeycloakDS datasource (set to 100).
*   **Affected Component:** The `org.keycloak.keycloak-model-infinispan` component is related to the fix.
