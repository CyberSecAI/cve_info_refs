Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-10374:

**1. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way PRTG handles the `what` parameter of the screenshot function within the "Contact Support" form.
*   A crafted UNC path, injected into the `what` parameter, is executed within the security context of the PRTG core server service.
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `what` parameter, which allows for arbitrary UNC paths to be processed by the Chromium engine responsible for creating screenshots, which in turn can lead to remote code execution.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the PRTG core server system.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `what` parameter isn't properly sanitized, allowing malicious UNC paths.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring user authentication.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation results in remote code execution on the PRTG core server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The code runs with the security context of the PRTG core server service potentially leading to significant system compromise.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation**: Ability to gain access to sensitive data or alter monitoring configurations.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST/GET Requests:** The attack is performed by sending malicious HTTP POST or GET requests containing the crafted UNC path within the `what` parameter.
*   **Screenshot Function:** The "Contact Support" form's screenshot function is abused to trigger the vulnerability.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the PRTG server's web interface.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attack does not require prior authentication on the PRTG server.
*   **Understanding of PRTG:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the PRTG system and the `what` parameter in the screenshot function for exploitation.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** PRTG versions 19.2.50 to 20.1.56 are vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block or sanitize requests with the `what` parameter.
    *   If a WAF is unavailable, rename `reporter.exe` in the PRTG installation directory, which disables PDF reporting and screenshots but blocks the attack vector, until an update can be performed.
*   **Patch:**  Updating to PRTG version 20.1.57.1745 or later patches the vulnerability.
*   **Internet Exposure:** The vulnerability is particularly concerning for PRTG installations accessible from the Internet.
*   **TEHTRIS Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered by TEHTRIS during a remote pentest.
*   **Public Exposure of PRTG:** As of April 1, 2020, over 30,000 PRTG servers were exposed to the internet, emphasizing the potential scale of the risk.
