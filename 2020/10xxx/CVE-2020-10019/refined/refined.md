  "CVE-2020-10019": {
    "description": "Buffer Overflow vulnerability in USB DFU of zephyr allows a USB connected host to cause possible remote code execution.",
    "root_cause": "The USB DFU implementation did not properly check the requested length (wLength) during a DFU_UPLOAD operation, allowing a host to request more data than the buffer could hold.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Possible remote code execution.",
     "attack_vector": "USB connected host sending a crafted DFU_UPLOAD request",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have a USB connection to the device. No further privilege is required, as this is exploitable via a standard USB interface.",
    "fixes": [
      "v1.14.2",
      "v2.2.0",
      "v2.1.1"
    ],
    "details": "The vulnerability exists in the DFU_UPLOAD handler, where the host specifies the amount of data to upload. If the host requests more data than the internal buffer size, it causes a buffer overflow.\n\nThe fix implemented was to ensure that the requested upload size does not exceed the buffer size allocated for the request."
