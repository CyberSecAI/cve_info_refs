| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1847832#c0)  Wade Mealing    2020-06-17 07:37:58 UTC  ```  A user with a local account and the ability to read the /sys/class/zram-control/hot_add file which on each read will create a zram device node in the /dev/ directory.  This allocates kernel memory and is not allocated to a user.  Continually reading this file may consume a large amount of system memory and cause the system OOM killer to activate, terminating userspace processes possibly making the system inoperable.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1847832#c2)  Wade Mealing    2020-06-17 08:09:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1697754](attachment.cgi?id=1697754&action=diff "Initial patch to change permissions on the file.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1697754&action=edit "Initial patch to change permissions on the file.") Initial patch to change permissions on the file.  Initial patch, not accepted upstream yet.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1847832#c9)  Wade Mealing    2020-06-18 04:47:39 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Changing permissions on the files within /sys will prevent regular users from being able to trigger this issue, however permissions changed within /sys do not persist between reboots and will need to be reapplied after each boot.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1847832#c10)  Wade Mealing    2020-06-18 06:07:46 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1848259](show_bug.cgi?id=1848259 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-10781 kernel: zram sysfs resource consumption [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1847832#c13)  Petr Matousek    2020-06-23 15:54:05 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Luca Bruno (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1847832#c14)  Petr Matousek    2020-06-23 15:54:09 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw is rated as having Low impact, because it is a denial of service only and requires the ZRAM kernel module to be loaded, which it is not the default, and oading kernel modules is a privileged operation.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1847832#c16)  Petr Matousek    2020-09-14 11:44:32 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/06/18/1> <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=853eab68afc80f59f36bbdeb715e5c88c501e680>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1847832#c17)  Justin M.

Subject: CVE-2020-10781 kernel: zram sysfs resource consumption

Gday,

A user with a local account and the ability to read the
/sys/class/zram-control/hot_add file which on each read will create a
zram device node in the /dev/ directory.  This allocates kernel memory
and is not allocated to a user.

Continually reading this file may consume a large amount of system
memory and cause the system OOM killer to activate, terminating

Debian Bug     : 966846 966917 968567

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leak.

CVE-2019-3874

    Kernel buffers allocated by the SCTP network protocol were not
    limited by the memory cgroup controller.  A local user could
    potentially use this to evade container memory limits and to cause
    a denial of service (excessive memory use).

CVE-2019-19448, CVE-2019-19813, CVE-2019-19816

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported bugs in Btrfs that could lead to a
    use-after-free or heap buffer overflow, and could be triggered by
    crafted filesystem images.  A user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystems could use these to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-10781

    Luca Bruno of Red Hat discovered that the zram control file
    /sys/class/zram-control/hot_add was readable by all users.  On a
    system with zram enabled, a local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12888

    It was discovered that the PCIe Virtual Function I/O (vfio-pci)
    driver allowed users to disable a device's memory space while it
    was still mapped into a process.  On some hardware platforms,
    local users or guest virtual machines permitted to access PCIe
    Virtual Functions could use this to cause a denial of service
    (hardware error and crash).

CVE-2020-14314

    A bug was discovered in the ext4 filesystem that could lead to an
    out-of-bound read.  A local user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystem images could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash).

CVE-2020-14331

    A bug was discovered in the VGA console driver's soft-scrollback
    feature that could lead to a heap buffer overflow.  On a system
    with a custom kernel that has CONFIG_VGACON_SOFT_SCROLLBACK
    enabled, a local user with access to a console could use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-14356

    A bug was discovered in the cgroup subsystem's handling of socket
    references to cgroups.  In some cgroup configurations, this could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user might be able to use this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-14385

    A bug was discovered in XFS, which could lead to an extended
    attribute (xattr) wrongly being detected as invalid.  A local user
    with access to an XFS filesystem could use this to cause a denial
    of service (filesystem shutdown).

CVE-2020-14386

    Or Cohen discovered a bug in the packet socket (AF_PACKET)
    implementation which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.  A
    local user with the CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any user namespace)
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-14390

    Minh Yuan discovered a bug in the framebuffer console driver's
    scrollback feature that could lead to a heap buffer overflow.  On
    a system using framebuffer consoles, a local user with access to a
    console could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    The scrollback feature has been disabled for now, as no other fix
    was available for this issue.

CVE-2020-16166

    Amit Klein reported that the random number generator used by the
    network stack might not be re-seeded for long periods of time,
    making e.g. client port number allocations more predictable.  This
    made it easier for remote attackers to carry out some network-
    based attacks such as DNS cache poisoning or device tracking.

CVE-2020-25212

    A bug was discovered in the NFSv4 client implementation that could
    lead to a heap buffer overflow.  A malicious NFS server could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly to execute arbitrary code on the client.

CVE-2020-25284

    It was discovered that the Rados block device (rbd) driver allowed
    tasks running as uid 0 to add and remove rbd devices, even if they
    dropped capabilities.  On a system with the rbd driver loaded,
    this might allow privilege escalation from a container with a task
    running as root.

CVE-2020-25285

    A race condition was discovered in the hugetlb filesystem's sysctl
    handlers, that could lead to stack corruption.  A local user
    permitted to write to hugepages sysctls could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.  By default only the root user can do this.

CVE-2020-25641

    The syzbot tool found a bug in the block layer that could lead to
    an infinite loop.  A local user with access to a raw block device
    could use this to cause a denial of service (unbounded CPU use and
    possible system hang).

CVE-2020-26088

    It was discovered that the NFC (Near Field Communication) socket
    implementation allowed any user to create raw sockets.  On a
    system with an NFC interface, this allowed local users to evade
    local network security policy.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.146-1~deb9u1.  This update additionally fixes Debian bugs
#966846, #966917, and #968567; and includes many more bug fixes from
stable updates 4.19.133-4.19.146 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.

For the detailed security status of linux-4.19 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux-4.19>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
