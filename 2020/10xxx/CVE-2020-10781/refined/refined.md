Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis of CVE-2020-10781:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `/sys/class/zram-control/hot_add` file was readable by all users. Reading this file triggers the creation of a zram device node in the `/dev/` directory, allocating kernel memory. This memory allocation was not accounted for the user triggering the action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Access:** The `hot_add` sysfs file had permissions that allowed any local user to read it.
*   **Unaccounted Memory Allocation:**  Each read operation on the `hot_add` file results in the allocation of kernel memory without accounting it to the user initiating the read. This lack of accounting allows a single user to consume excessive kernel memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Repeatedly reading the `/sys/class/zram-control/hot_add` file can lead to excessive consumption of system memory. This can trigger the Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer, which terminates random user-space processes, potentially rendering the system inoperable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker requires a local user account on the affected system.
*   **File Read:** The attacker needs the ability to read the `/sys/class/zram-control/hot_add` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs a local user account on the system.
*   The ZRAM kernel module needs to be loaded for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
*   The attacker must be able to read the `/sys/class/zram-control/hot_add` file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability has a "Low" severity rating because it requires the ZRAM kernel module to be loaded, which is not the default.
*   The fix involves changing the permissions of the `hot_add` file to prevent regular users from reading it.
*   A patch has been created to change the file permissions to 0400, making it only readable by the root user.
*   The issue was fixed in the Linux kernel version 5.8-rc6.
*   Mitigation strategies include changing permissions on the file, but these changes do not persist across reboots.
