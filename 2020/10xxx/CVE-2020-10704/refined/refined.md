{
  "CVE-2020-10704": {
    "description": "A deeply nested filter in an un-authenticated LDAP search can exhaust the LDAP server's stack memory causing a SIGSEGV.",
    "root_cause": "The recursive nature of LDAP filters, and mirrored recursion in Samba's parser, leads to stack exhaustion. Each filter consumes around 600 bytes of stack memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack overflow due to recursive parsing of LDAP filters",
      "Lack of proper input validation on LDAP search requests",
      "Single process for CLDAP"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) via a server crash (SIGSEGV). For versions using the 'prefork' model, a crash of a single process impacts multiple clients, and may disrupt the service for other clients.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted LDAP search request with deeply nested filters to the LDAP port (389/TCP)",
       "Sending a CLDAP packet (UDP port 389) containing a large, deeply nested filter, if the network allows large enough packets",
       "Attacker does not need to be authenticated"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can be remote, and need not be authenticated"
  }
