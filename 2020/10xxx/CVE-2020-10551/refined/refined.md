  "cveId": "CVE-2020-10551",
  "description": "QQBrowser versions prior to 10.5.3870.400 improperly set Access Control Lists (ACLs) for the `TsService.exe` file. A local, unprivileged attacker can overwrite this file, leading to arbitrary code execution with `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` privileges.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "Improper Access Control",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-284"
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation. An attacker can achieve code execution with SYSTEM privileges, the highest level of permissions in Windows.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local access to the vulnerable system."
    ],
   "requiredCapabilities": [
      "Ability to execute code locally.",
      "Ability to write to the file system."
   ]
  },
    "additionalInformation": {
    "affectedSoftware": {
        "name": "QQBrowser",
        "versions": "All versions prior to 10.5.3870.400"
      },
    "exploitDetails": "The `TsService.exe` file located in the installation directory (default: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Tencent\\QQBrowser\\TsService.exe`) allows write access to members of the `NT AUTHORITY\\Authenticated Users` group, which by default includes all users. An attacker can replace this executable with their own malicious file. When the associated Windows service starts, the attacker's code will be executed with `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` privileges.",
     "remediation": "Upgrade to the latest version of QQBrowser."
