{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper access control in Eclipse Che allowed pods within a Kubernetes cluster to bypass the JWT proxy.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate enforcement of authentication and authorization.",
      "Insufficient isolation between workspace pods."
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user can bypass the JWT proxy and gain unauthorized access to other users' workspace pods, potentially leading to complete compromise of the targeted workspace, including access to the machine-exec container. Successful exploitation requires knowledge of the service name and namespace of the target pod.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network communication between pods within the same Kubernetes cluster."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the Eclipse Che environment. They also need to have knowledge of the target service name and namespace of the target workspace pod. Some comments suggest the attacker may need high privileges in cluster-wide scope as well."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Eclipse Che versions up to 7.8.x",
    "Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces 2.0"
  ],
  "fixed_versions": [
    "Eclipse Che 7.9.0"
   ]
