  "CVE-2020-10808": {
    "Description": "Vesta Control Panel (VestaCP) through 0.9.8-26 allows Command Injection via the schedule/backup Backup Listing Endpoint. The attacker must be able to create a crafted filename on the server, as demonstrated by an FTP session that renames .bash_logout to a .bash_logout' substring followed by shell metacharacters.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `v-list-user-backup` bash script, specifically in how it processes the `backup.conf` file. The script uses `eval` to interpret the contents of this file, which includes user-controlled data (filenames) extracted during backup procedures. By injecting shell metacharacters into a filename, this input is then executed by `eval`, leading to command injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "OS Command Injection (CWE-78)",
      "Insecure use of eval",
      "Lack of input sanitization of filenames"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the target system.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Network access is required",
      "Authenticated access is required"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Must have valid user credentials to access the Vesta Control Panel.",
      "Must be able to upload files to a user's home directory, typically via FTP, to inject the payload within a filename.",
      "Must be able to trigger a backup operation."
    ],
    "Additional details": [
      "The exploit involves modifying a filename (e.g., .bash_logout) via FTP to include shell metacharacters.",
        "The v-backup-user script adds the modified filename to `backup.conf`.",
      "The v-list-user-backups script then executes `eval` on the contents of `backup.conf`.",
      "This results in arbitrary command execution with root privileges due to the sudo permissions on the called scripts.",
        "A Metasploit module has been developed to automate the exploitation of this vulnerability"
    ]
