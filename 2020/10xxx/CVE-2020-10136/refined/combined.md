[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

[1](#section-1).  Introduction

   With NAT devices becoming increasingly more prevalent, there have
   recently been many tunneling protocols developed that go through NAT
   devices or firewalls by tunneling over UDP or TCP.  For example,
   Teredo [[RFC4380](/doc/html/rfc4380 "\"Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through Network Address Translations (NATs)\"")], Layer Two Tunneling Protocol Version 2 (L2TPv2)
   [[RFC2661](/doc/html/rfc2661 "\"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol \"")], and Layer Two Tunneling Protocol Version 3 (L2TPv3)
   [[RFC3931](/doc/html/rfc3931 "\"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)\"")] all tunnel IP packets over UDP.  Similarly, many Secure
   Socket Layer (SSL) VPN solutions that tunnel IP packets over HTTP
   (and hence over TCP) are deployed today.

   This document discusses security concerns with tunneling IP packets
   and includes recommendations where relevant.

   The primary intent of this document is to help improve security
   deployments using tunnel protocols.  In addition, the document aims
   to provide information that can be used in any new or updated tunnel
   protocol specification.  The intended audience of this document
   includes network administrators and future protocol developers.

[2](#section-2).  Tunnels May Bypass Security

[2.1](#section-2.1).  Network Security Bypass

[2.1.1](#section-2.1.1).  Problem

   Tunneled IP traffic may not receive the intended level of inspection
   or policy application by network-based security devices unless such
   devices are specifically tunnel aware.  This reduces defense in depth
   and may cause security gaps.  This applies to all network-located
   devices and to any end-host-based firewalls whose existing hooking
   mechanism(s) would not show them the IP packet stream after the
   tunnel client does decapsulation or before it does encapsulation.

[2.1.2](#section-2.1.2).  Discussion

   Evasion by tunneling is often a problem for network-based security
   devices such as network firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention
   systems, and router controls.  To provide such functionality in the
   presence of tunnels, the developer of such devices must add support
   for parsing each new protocol.  There is typically a significant lag
   between when the security developer recognizes that a tunnel will be
   used (or will be remotely usable) to a significant degree and when
   the parsing can be implemented in a product update, the update can be
   tested and released, and customers can begin using the update.  Late
   changes in the protocol specification or in the way it is implemented
   can cause additional delays.  This becomes a significant security
   concern when a delay in applied coverage is occurring frequently.

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   One way to cut down on this lag is for security developers to follow
   the progress of new IETF protocols, but this will still not account
   for any new proprietary protocols.

   For example, for L2TP or Teredo, an unaware network security device
   would inspect or regulate the outer IP and the IP-based UDP layer as
   normal, but it would not recognize that there is an additional IP
   layer contained inside the UDP payload to which it needs to apply the
   same controls as it would to a native packet.  (Of course, if the
   device discards the packet due to something in the IP or UDP header,
   such as referring to an unknown protocol, the embedded packet is no
   longer a concern.)  In addition, if the tunnel does encryption, the
   network-based security device may not be able to do much, just as if
   IPsec end-to-end encryption were used without tunneling.

   Network security controls not being applied must be a concern to
   those that set them up, since those controls are supposed to provide
   an additional layer of defense against external attackers.  If
   network controls are being bypassed due to the use of tunneling, the
   strength of the defense (i.e., the number of layers of defense) is
   reduced.  Since security administrators may have a significantly
   reduced level of confidence without this layer, this becomes a
   concern to them.

   One implication of the security control bypass is that defense in
   depth has been reduced, perhaps down to zero unless a local firewall
   is in use as recommended in [[RFC4380](/doc/html/rfc4380 "\"Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through Network Address Translations (NATs)\"")].  However, even if there are
   host-based security controls that recognize tunnels and all controls
   that were maintained by the network are available on the host,
   security administrators may not have configured them with full
   security control parity.  Thus, there may be gaps in desired
   coverage.

   Compounding this is that, unlike what would be the case for native
   IP, some network administrators will not even be aware that their
   hosts are globally reachable if the tunnel provides connectivity
   to/from the Internet; for example, they may not be expecting this for
   hosts behind a stateful firewall.  In addition, [Section 3.2](#section-3.2) discusses
   how it may not be efficient to find all tunneled traffic for network
   devices to examine.

[2.1.3](#section-2.1.3).  Recommendations

   Security administrators who do not consider tunneling an acceptable
   risk should disable tunnel functionality either on the end nodes
   (hosts) or on the network nodes at the perimeter of their network.
   However, there may be an awareness gap.  Thus, due to the possible
   negative security consequences, tunneling functionality should be

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   easy to disable on the host and through a central management facility
   if one is provided.

   To minimize security exposure due to tunnels, we recommend that a
   tunnel be an interface of last resort, independent of IP version.
   Specifically, we suggest that when both native and tunneled access to
   a remote host is available, the native access be used in preference
   to tunneled access except when the tunnel endpoint is known to not
   bypass security (e.g., an IPsec tunnel to a gateway provided by the
   security administrator of the network).  This should also promote
   greater efficiency and reliability.

   Note that although Rule 7 of [[RFC3484], SectionÂ 6](/doc/html/rfc3484#section-6) will prefer native
   connectivity over tunnels, this rule is only a tie-breaker when a
   choice is not made by earlier rules; hence, tunneling mechanisms that
   are tied to a particular range of IP address space will be decided
   based on the prefix precedence.  For example, using the prefix policy
   mechanism of [[RFC3484], SectionÂ 2.1](/doc/html/rfc3484#section-2.1), Teredo might have a precedence
   of 5 so that native IPv4 is preferred over Teredo.

[2.2](#section-2.2).  IP Ingress and Egress Filtering Bypass

[2.2.1](#section-2.2.1).  Problem

   IP addresses inside tunnels are not subject to ingress and egress
   filtering in the network they tunnel over, unless extraordinary
   measures are taken.  Only the tunnel endpoints can do such filtering.

[2.2.2](#section-2.2.2).  Discussion

   Ingress filtering (sanity-checking incoming destination addresses)
   and egress filtering (sanity-checking outgoing source addresses) are
   done to mitigate attacks and to make it easier to identify the source
   of a packet and are considered to be a good practice.  For example,
   ingress filtering at the network perimeter should not allow packets
   with a source address that belongs to the network to enter the
   network from outside the network.  This function is most naturally
   (and in the general case, by requirement) done at network boundaries.
   Tunneled IP traffic bypassing this network control is a specific case
   of [Section 2.1](#section-2.1), but is illustrative.

[2.2.3](#section-2.2.3).  Recommendations

   Tunnel servers can apply ingress and egress controls to tunneled IP
   addresses passing through them to and from tunnel clients.

   Tunnel clients could make an effort to conduct ingress and egress
   filtering.

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   Implementations of protocols that embed an IPv4 address in a tunneled
   IPv6 address directly between peers should perform filtering based on
   checking the correspondence.

   Implementations of protocols that accept tunneled packets directly
   from a server, relay, or protocol peer do filtering the same way as
   it would be done on a native link with traffic from a router.

   Some protocols such as 6to4 [[RFC3056](/doc/html/rfc3056 "\"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds\"")], Teredo, and the Intra-Site
   Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) [[RFC5214](/doc/html/rfc5214 "\"Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)\"")] allow both
   other hosts and a router over a common tunnel.  To perform host-based
   filtering with such protocols, a host would need to know the outer IP
   address of each router from which it could receive traffic, so that
   packets from hosts beyond the router will be accepted even though the
   source address would not embed the router's IP address.  Router
   addresses might be learned via SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)
   [[RFC3971](/doc/html/rfc3971 "\"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)\"")] or some other mechanism (e.g., [[RFC5214], SectionÂ 8.3.2](/doc/html/rfc5214#section-8.3.2)).

[2.3](#section-2.3).  Source Routing after the Tunnel Client

[2.3.1](#section-2.3.1).  Problem

   If the encapsulated IP packet specifies source routing beyond the
   recipient tunnel client, the host may forward the IP packet to the
   specified next hop.  This may be unexpected and contrary to
   administrator wishes and may have bypassed network-based source-
   routing controls.

[2.3.2](#section-2.3.2).  Discussion

   A detailed discussion of issues related to source routing can be
   found in [[RFC5095](/doc/html/rfc5095 "\"Deprecation of Type 0 Routing Headers in IPv6\"")] and [[SECA-IP](#ref-SECA-IP "\"Security Assessment of the Internet Protocol version 4\"")].

[2.3.3](#section-2.3.3).  Recommendations

   Tunnel clients should by default discard tunneled IP packets that
   specify additional routing, as recommended in [[RFC5095](/doc/html/rfc5095 "\"Deprecation of Type 0 Routing Headers in IPv6\"")] and
   [[SECA-IP](#ref-SECA-IP "\"Security Assessment of the Internet Protocol version 4\"")], though they may also allow the user to configure what
   source-routing types are allowed.  All pre-existing source-routing
   controls should be upgraded to apply these controls to tunneled IP
   packets as well.

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

[3](#section-3).  Challenges in Inspecting and Filtering Content of Tunneled Data
    Packets

[3.1](#section-3.1).  Inefficiency of Selective Network Filtering of All Tunneled
      Packets

[3.1.1](#section-3.1.1).  Problem

   There is no mechanism that both efficiently and immediately filters
   all tunneled packets (other than the obviously faulty method of
   filtering all packets).  This limits the ability to prevent tunnel
   use on a network.

[3.1.2](#section-3.1.2).  Discussion

   Given concerns about tunnel security or a network's lack of
   preparedness for tunnels, a network administrator may wish to simply
   block all use of tunnels that bypass security policies.  He or she
   may wish to do so using network controls; this could be either due to
   not having the capability to disable tunneling on all hosts attached
   to the network or due to wanting an extra layer of prevention.

   One simple method of doing this easily for many tunnel protocols is
   to block outbound packets to the UDP or TCP port used (e.g.,
   destination UDP port is 3544 for Teredo, UDP port 1701 for L2TP,
   etc.).  This prevents a tunnel client from establishing a new tunnel.
   However, existing tunnels will not necessarily be affected if the
   blocked port is used only for initial setup.  In addition, if the
   blocking is applied on the outside of the client's NAT device, the
   NAT device will retain the port mapping for the client.  In some
   cases, however, blocking all traffic to a given outbound port (e.g.,
   port 80) may interfere with non-tunneled traffic so this should be
   used with caution.

   Another simple alternative, if the tunnel server addresses are well-
   known, is to filter out all traffic to/from such addresses.

   The other approach is to find all packets to block in the same way as
   would be done for inspecting all packets ([Section 3.2](#section-3.2)).  However,
   this presents difficulties in terms of efficiency of filtering, as is
   discussed in [Section 3.2](#section-3.2).

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

[3.1.3](#section-3.1.3).  Recommendations

   Developers of protocols that tunnel over UDP or TCP (including HTTP)
   to reach the Internet should disable their protocols in networks that
   wish to enforce security policies on the user traffic.  (Windows, for
   example, disables Teredo by default if it detects that it is within
   an enterprise network that contains a Windows domain controller.)

   Administrators of such networks may wish to filter all tunneled
   traffic at the boundaries of their networks.  It is sufficient to
   filter out the tunneled connection requests (if they can be
   identified) to stop further tunneled traffic.  The easiest mechanism
   for this would be to filter out outgoing traffic sent to the
   destination port defined by the tunneling protocol and incoming
   traffic with that source port.  Similarly, in certain cases, it is
   also possible to use the IP protocol field to identify and filter
   tunneled packets.  For example, 6to4 [[RFC3056](/doc/html/rfc3056 "\"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds\"")] is a tunneling
   mechanism that uses IPv4 packets to carry encapsulated IPv6 packets
   and can be identified by the IPv4 protocol type 41.

[3.2](#section-3.2).  Problems with Deep Packet Inspection of Tunneled Data Packets

[3.2.1](#section-3.2.1).  Problem

   There is no efficient mechanism for network-based devices, which are
   not the tunnel endpoint, to inspect the contents of all tunneled data
   packets the way they can for native packets.  This makes it difficult
   to apply the same controls as they do to native IP.

[3.2.2](#section-3.2.2).  Discussion

   Some tunnel protocols are easy to identify, such as if all data
   packets are encapsulated using a well-known UDP or TCP port that is
   unique to the protocol.

   Other protocols, however, either use dynamic ports for data traffic
   or else share ports with other protocols (e.g., tunnels over HTTP).

   The implication of this is that network-based devices that wish to
   passively inspect (and perhaps selectively apply policy to) all
   encapsulated traffic must inspect all TCP or UDP packets (or at least
   all packets not part of a session that is known not to be a tunnel).
   This is imperfect since a heuristic must then be applied to determine
   if a packet is indeed part of a tunnel.  This may be too slow to make
   use of in practice, especially if it means that all TCP or UDP
   packets must be taken off of the device's "fast path".

```

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   One heuristic that can be used on packets to determine if they are
   tunnel-related or not is as follows.  For each known tunnel protocol,
   attempt parsing the packet as if it were a packet of that protocol
   destined to the local host (i.e., where the local host has the
   destination address in the inner IP header, if any).  If all syntax
   checks pass, up to and including the inner IP header (if the tunnel
   does not use encryption), then treat the packet as if it were a
   tunneled packet of that protocol.

   It is possible that non-tunneled packets will be treated as if they
   were tunneled packets using this heuristic, but tunneled packets (of
   the known types of tunnels) should not escape inspection, absent
   implementation bugs.

   For some protocols, it may be possible to monitor setup exchanges to
   know to expect that data will be exchanged on certain ports later.
   (Note that this does not necessarily apply to Teredo, for example,
   since communicating with another Teredo client behind a cone NAT
   [[RFC5389](/doc/html/rfc5389 "\"Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)\"")] device does not require such signaling.  In such cases this
   control will not work.  However, deprecation of the cone bit as
   discussed in [[RFC5991](/doc/html/rfc5991 "\"Teredo Security Updates\"")] means this technique may indeed work with
   updated Teredo implementations.)

[3.2.3](#section-3.2.3).  Recommendations

   As illustrated above, it should be clear that inspecting the contents
   of tunneled data packets is highly complex and often impractical.
   For this reason, if a network wishes to monitor IP traffic, tunneling
   across, as opposed to tunneling to, the security boundary is not
   recommended.  For example, to provide an IPv6 transition solution,
   the network should provide native IPv6 connectivity or a tunnel
   solution (e.g., ISATAP or 6over4 [[RFC2529](/doc/html/rfc2529 "\"Transmission of IPv6 over IPv4 Domains without Explicit Tunnels\"")]) that encapsulates data

[4](#section-4).  Increased Exposure Due to Tunneling

[4.1](#section-4.1).  NAT Holes Increase Attack Surface

[4.1.1](#section-4.1.1).  Problem

   If the tunnel allows inbound access from the public Internet, the
   opening created in a NAT device due to a tunnel client increases its
   Internet attack surface area.  If vulnerabilities are present, this
   increased exposure can be used by attackers and their programs.

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   If the tunnel allows inbound access only from a private network
   (e.g., a remote network to which one has VPNed), the opening created
   in the NAT device still increases its attack surface area, although
   not as much as in the public Internet case.

[4.1.2](#section-4.1.2).  Discussion

   When a tunnel is active, a mapped port is maintained on the NAT
   device through which remote hosts can send packets and perhaps
   establish connections.  The following sequence is intended to sketch
   out the processing on the tunnel client host that can be reached
   through this mapped port; the actual processing for a given host may
   be somewhat different.

   1.  Link-layer protocol processing

   2.  (Outer) IP host firewall processing

   3.  (Outer) IP processing by stack

   4.  UDP/TCP processing by stack

   5.  Tunnel client processing

   6.  (Inner) IP host firewall processing

   7.  (Inner) IP processing by stack

   8.  Various upper layer processing may follow

   The inner firewall (and other security) processing may or may not be
   present, but if it is, some of the inner IP processing may be
   filtered.  (For example, [[RFC4380], SectionÂ 7.1](/doc/html/rfc4380#section-7.1) recommends that an
   IPv6 host firewall be used on all Teredo clients.)

   (By the virtue of the tunnel being active, we can infer that the
   inner host firewall is unlikely to do any filtering based on the
   outer IP.)  Any of this processing may expose vulnerabilities an
   attacker can exploit; similarly, these may expose information to an
   attacker.  Thus, even if firewall filtering is in place (as is
   prudent) and filters all incoming packets, the exposed area is larger
   than if a native IP Internet connection were in place, due to the
   processing that takes place before the inner IP is reached
   (specifically, the UDP/TCP processing, the tunnel client processing,
   and additional IP processing, especially if one is IPv4 and the other
   is IPv6).

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   One possibility is that a layer 3 (L3) targeted worm makes use of a
   vulnerability in the exposed processing.  The main benefit tunneling
   provides to worms is enabling L3 reachability to the end host.  Even
   a thoroughly firewalled host could be subject to a worm that spreads
   with a single UDP packet if the right remote code vulnerability is
   present.

[4.1.3](#section-4.1.3).  Recommendation

   This problem seems inherent in tunneling being active on a host, so
   the solution seems to be to minimize tunneling use.

   For example, tunneling can be active only when it is really needed
   and only for as long as needed.  So, the tunnel interface can be
   initially not configured and only used when it is entirely the last
   resort.  The interface should then be deactivated (ideally,
   automatically) again as soon as possible.  Note, however, that the
   hole will remain in the NAT device for some amount of time after
   this, so some processing of incoming packets is inevitable unless the
   client's native IP address behind the NAT device is changed.

[4.2](#section-4.2).  Exposure of a NAT Hole

[4.2.1](#section-4.2.1).  Problem

   Attackers are more likely to know about a tunnel client's NAT hole
   than a typical hole in the NAT device.  If they know about the hole,
   they could try to use it.

[4.2.2](#section-4.2.2).  Discussion

   There are at least three reasons why an attacker may be more likely
   to learn of the tunnel client's exposed port than a typical NAT
   exposed port:

   1.  The NAT mapping for a tunnel is typically held open for a
       significant period of time and kept stable.  This increases the
       chance of it being discovered.

   2.  In some protocols (e.g., Teredo), the external IP address and
       port are contained in the client's address that is used end-to-
       end and possibly even advertised in a name resolution system.
       While the tunnel protocol itself might only distribute this
       address in IP headers, peers, routers, and other on-path nodes
       still see the client's IP address.  Although this point does not
       apply directly to protocols that do not construct the inner IP
       address based on the outer IP address (e.g., L2TP), the inner IP

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

       address is still known to peers, routers, etc., and can still be
       reached by attackers without their knowing the external IP
       address or port.

   3.  Sending packets over a tunnel often results in more message
       exchanges due to the tunneling protocol, as well as messages
       being seen by more parties (e.g., due to a longer path length),
       than sending packets natively, offering more chances for
       visibility into the port and address in use.

[4.2.3](#section-4.2.3).  Recommendation

   The recommendation from [Section 4.1](#section-4.1) seems to apply here as well:
   minimize tunnel use.

[4.3](#section-4.3).  Public Tunnels Widen Holes in Restricted NATs

[4.3.1](#section-4.3.1).  Problem

   Tunnels that allow inbound connectivity from the Internet (e.g.,
   Teredo, tunnel brokers, etc.) essentially disable the filtering
   behavior of the NAT for all tunnel client ports.  This eliminates NAT
   devices filtering for such ports and may eliminate the need for an
   attacker to spoof an address.

[4.3.2](#section-4.3.2).  Discussion

   NATs that implement Address-Dependent or Address and Port-Dependent
   Filtering [[RFC4787](/doc/html/rfc4787 "\"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP\"")] limit the source of incoming packets to just
   those that are a previous destination.  This poses a problem for
   tunnels that intend to allow inbound connectivity from the Internet.

   Various protocols (e.g., Teredo, Session Traversal Utilities for NAT
   (STUN) [[RFC5389](/doc/html/rfc5389 "\"Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)\"")], etc.) provide a facility for peers, upon request,
   to become a previous destination.  This works by sending a "bubble"
   packet via a server, which is passed to the client and then sent by
   the client (through the NAT) to the originator.

   This removes any NAT-based barrier to attackers sending packets in
   through the client's service port.  In particular, an attacker would
   no longer need to either be an actual previous destination or forge
   its addresses as a previous destination.  When forging, the attacker
   would have had to learn of a previous destination and then would face
   more challenges in seeing any returned traffic.

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

[4.3.3](#section-4.3.3).  Recommendations

   If the tunnel can provide connectivity to the Internet, the tunnel
   client should run a host firewall on the tunnel interface.  Also,
   minimizing public tunnel use (see [Section 4.1.3](#section-4.1.3)) would lower the
   attack opportunity related to this exposure.

[5](#section-5).  Tunnel Address Concerns

[5.1](#section-5.1).  Feasibility of Guessing Tunnel Addresses

[5.1.1](#section-5.1.1).  Problem

   For some types of tunneling protocols, it may be feasible to guess IP
   addresses assigned to tunnels, either when looking for a specific
   client or when looking for an arbitrary client.  This is in contrast
   to native IPv6 addresses in general but is no worse than for native
   IPv4 addresses today.

   For example, some protocols (e.g., 6to4 and Teredo) use well-defined
   address ranges.  As another example, using well-known public servers
   for Teredo or tunnel brokers also implies using a well-known address
   range.

[5.1.2](#section-5.1.2).  Discussion

   Several tunnel protocols use endpoint addresses that can be
   algorithmically derived from some known values.  These addresses are
   structured, and the fields contained in them can be fairly
   predictable.  This reduces the search space for an attacker and
   reduces the resistance of the address to scanning attacks.

[5.1.3](#section-5.1.3).  Recommendations

   It is recommended that tunnel protocol developers use tunnel endpoint
   addresses that are not easily guessable.  When the tunnel endpoint
   addresses are structured and fairly guessable, it is recommended that
   the implementation use any unused fields in the address to provide
   additional entropy to the address in order to reduce the address-
   scanning risks.  For example, this could be done by setting these
   unused fields to some random values.

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

[5.2](#section-5.2).  Profiling Targets Based on Tunnel Address

[5.2.1](#section-5.2.1).  Problem

   An attacker encountering an address associated with a particular
   tunneling protocol or well-known tunnel server has the opportunity to
   infer certain relevant pieces of information that can be used to
   profile the host before sending any packets.  This can reduce the
   attacker's footprint and increase the attacker's efficiency.

[5.2.2](#section-5.2.2).  Discussion

   The tunnel address reveals some information about the nature of the
   client:

   o  That a host has a tunnel address associated with a given protocol
      means that the client is running on some platform for which there
      exists a tunnel client implementation of that protocol.  In
      addition, if some platforms have that protocol installed by
      default and if the host's default rules for using it make it
      susceptible to being in use, then the protocol is more likely to
      be running on such a platform than on one where it is not used by
      default.  For example, as of this writing, seeing a Teredo address
      suggests that the host it is on is probably running Windows.

   o  Similarly, the use of an address associated with a particular
      tunnel server also suggests some information.  Tunnel client
      software is often deployed, installed, and/or configured using
      some degree of automation.  It seems likely that the majority of
      the time, the tunnel server that results from the initial
      configuration will go unchanged from the initial setting.
      Moreover, the server that is configured for use may be associated
      with a particular means of installation, which often suggests the
      platform.  For example, if the server field in a Teredo address is
      one of the IPv4 addresses to which teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com
      resolves, the host is likely running Windows.

   o  The external IPv4 address of a NAT device can, of course, be
      readily associated with a particular organization or at least an
      ISP; hence, putting this address in an IPv6 address reveals this
      information.  However, this is no different than using a native IP
      address and is therefore not new with tunneling.

   o  It is also possible that external client port numbers may be more
      often associated with particular client software or the platform
      on which it is running.  The usefulness of this for platform
      determination is, however, reduced by the different NAT port

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

      number assignment behaviors.  In addition, the same observations
      would apply to use of UDP or TCP over native IP as well; hence,
      this is not new with tunneling.

   The platform, tunnel client software, or organization information can
   be used by an attacker to target attacks more carefully.  For
   example, an attacker may decide to attack an address only if it is
   likely to be associated with a particular platform or tunnel client
   software with a known vulnerability.  (This is similar to the ability
   to guess some platforms based on the Organizationally Unique
   Identifier (OUI) in the Extended Unique Identifier (EUI)-64 portion
   of an IPv6 address generated from a Media Access Control (MAC)
   address, since some platforms are commonly used with interface cards
   from particular vendors.)

[5.2.3](#section-5.2.3).  Recommendations

   If installation programs randomize the server setting, they would
   reduce the extent to which they can be profiled.  Similarly,
   administrators can choose to change the default setting to reduce the
   degree to which they can be profiled ahead of time.

   Randomizing the tunnel client port in use would mitigate any
   profiling that can be done based on the external port, especially if
   multiple tunnel clients did this.  Further discussion on randomizing
   ports can be found at [[RFC6056](/doc/html/rfc6056 "\"Recommendations for Transport- Protocol Port Randomization\"")].

   It is recommended that tunnel protocols minimize the propagation of
   knowledge about whether the NAT is a cone NAT.

[6](#section-6).  Additional Security Concerns

[6.1](#section-6.1).  Attacks Facilitated by Changing Tunnel Server Setting

[6.1.1](#section-6.1.1).  Problem

   If an attacker could change either a tunnel client's server setting
   or the IP addresses to which a configured host name resolves (e.g.,
   by intercepting DNS queries) AND if the tunnel is not authenticated,
   the attacker would become a man in the middle.  This would allow them
   to at least monitor peer communication and at worst to impersonate
   the remote peer.

[6.1.2](#section-6.1.2).  Discussion

   A client's server has good visibility into the client's communication
   with IP peers.  If the server were switched to one that records this
   information and makes it available to third parties (e.g.,

Krishnan, et al.             Informational                     [Page 15]

```

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   advertisers, competitors, spouses, etc.), then sensitive information
   would be disclosed, especially if the client's host prefers the
   tunnel over native IP.  Assuming the server provides good service,
   the user would not have reason to suspect the change.

   Full interception of IP traffic could also be arranged (including
   pharming), which would allow any number of deception or monitoring
   attacks, including phishing.  We illustrate this with an example
   phishing attack scenario.

   It is often assumed that the tunnel server is a trusted entity.  It
   may be possible for malware or a malicious user to quietly change the
   client's tunnel server setting and have the user be unaware that
   their trust has been misplaced for an indefinite period of time.
   However, malware or a malicious user can do much worse than this, so
   this is not a significant concern.  Hence, it is only important that
   an attacker on the network cannot change the client's server setting.

   1.  A phisher sets up a malicious tunnel server (or tampers with a
       legitimate one).  This server, for the most part, provides
       correct service.

   2.  An attacker, by some means, switches the host's tunnel server
       setting or spoofs a DNS reply to point to the above server.  If
       neither DNS nor the tunnel setup is secured (i.e., if the client
       does not authenticate the information), then the attacker's
       tunnel server is seen as legitimate.

   3.  A user on the victim host types their bank's URL into his/her
       browser.

   4.  The bank's hostname resolves to one or more IP addresses, and the
       tunnel is selected for socket connection for whatever reason
       (e.g., the tunnel provides IPv6 connectivity, and the bank has an
       IPv6 address).

   5.  The tunnel client uses the server for help in connecting to the
       bank's IP address.  Some tunneling protocols use a separate
       channel for signaling versus data, but this still allows the
       server to place itself in the data path by an appropriate signal
       to the client.  For example, in Teredo, the client sends a ping
       request through a server, which is expected to come back through
       a data relay, and a malicious server can simply send it back
       itself to indicate that is a data relay for the communication.

Krishnan, et al.             Informational                     [Page 16]
```

```

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   6.  The rest works pretty much like any normal phishing transaction,
       except that the attacker acts as a tunnel server (or data relay,
       for protocols such as Teredo) and a host with the bank's IP
       address.

   This pharming-type attack is not unique to tunneling.  Switching DNS
   server settings to a malicious DNS server or DNS cache poisoning in a
   recursive DNS resolver could have a similar effect.

[6.1.3](#section-6.1.3).  Recommendations

   In general, anti-phishing and anti-fraud provisions should help with
   aspects of this, as well as software that specifically monitors for
   tunnel server changes.

   Perhaps the best way to mitigate tunnel-specific attacks is to have
   the client authenticate either the tunnel server or at least the
   means by which the tunnel server's IP address is determined.  For
   example, SSL VPNs use https URLs and hence authenticate the server as
   being the expected one.  When IPv6 Router Advertisements are sent
   over the tunnel, another mechanism is to use SEcure Neighbor
   Discovery (SEND) [[RFC3971](/doc/html/rfc3971 "\"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)\"")] to verify that the client trusts the
   server.

   On the host, it should require an appropriate level of privilege in
   order to change the tunnel server setting (as well as other non-
   tunnel-specific settings such as the DNS server setting, etc.).
   Making it easy to see the current tunnel server setting (e.g., not
   requiring privilege for this) should help detection of changes.

   The scope of the attack can also be reduced by limiting tunneling use
   in general but especially in preferring native IPv4 to tunneled IPv6
   when connecting to peers who are accessible over IPv4, as doing so
   helps mitigate attacks that are facilitated by changing the tunnel
   server setting.  Please refer to Section 3 of [[TUNNEL-LOOPS](#ref-TUNNEL-LOOPS)] for a
   detailed description and mitigation measures for a class of attacks
   based on IPv6 automatic tunnels.

[7](#section-7).  Mechanisms to Secure the Use of Tunnels

   This document described several security issues with tunnels.  This
   does not mean that tunnels need to be avoided at any cost.  On the
   contrary, tunnels can be very useful if deployed, operated, and used
   properly.  The threats against IP tunnels are documented here.  If
   the threats can be mitigated, network administrators can efficiently
   and securely use tunnels in their network.  Several measures can be
   taken in order to secure the operation of IPv6 tunnels:

Jun 14, 2021
###### **FragAttacks - WiFi Fregmentation and Aggregation Attacks**

At this time, Digi is still reviewing these attacks and how they impact our devices. From the nature of the attacks, we do expect that Digi devices will be impacted.

However, it is critical to note that even with these attacks, it has always been DIgi's policy and suggestions that network communication should never rely on the protections and standards of the data layers (WiFi/BlueTooth). Many of these are implemented in HW and can be difficult to change. If good network practices are used, (TLS/Certificates etc), then these vulnerabilities do not lead to any real impact. These vulnerabilites can only become impactful IF other flaws or issues are present.

It is Digi's intent to address these issues so that we preserve our defense in depth strategy to security in our products. Due to the complexity of these issues, we believe we will be able to address these by Q4 of 2021 or sooner if possible.

Dec 09, 2020
###### **AMNESIA:33 - VU#815128 - Multiple TCP/IP stacks used in Internet of Things (IoT have several vulnerabilities stemming from improper memory management.**

Digi International has never manufactured any products that could be impacted by the AMNESIA:33 vulnerabilities. There is no action required by any of our customers.

Jun 16, 2020
###### **RIPPLE20 - Multiple vulnerabilities in TRECK TCP/IP embedded software - VU#257161**

A number of high level vulnerabilities (CVE's) that affect the TCP/IP internal stack processing have been identified. Digi has been working with customers since February to install firmware updates to address the issue. Under specific circumstances, it may be possible that these vulnerabilities could lead to a remote code execution via a network based attack without authentication.

Jun 02, 2020
###### **Reflection attack WR11,WR21,WR31,WR41,WR44 series routers - VU#636397 - CVE-2020-10136**

A high level vulnerability (CVSS => 7.0) was discovered on the Digi WR11,WR21,WR31,WR41, and WR44 cellular routers. The attack allows IP-in-IP encapsulation to be used to route arbitrary network traffic through a vulnerable device.

Please download firmware V8.1.0.1 (or greater) for a fix for this issue. Alternatively, enabling the firewall feature on the devices WAN interface (or cellular interface) port will also mitigate this attack.

For more information on this vulnerability, please see the knowledge base article within the Digi support section

# cve-2020-10136

You can use this code to verify if your device supports default IP-in-IP
encapsulation from arbitrary sources to arbitrary destinations. The intended
use of this code requires at least two more devices with distinct IP
addresses for these two devices. The testing in "bypass" mode requires
the vulnerable device to be "dual-homed" so routing to the "inside"
network from an external network interface can be verified.

Spoof mode:

[![Spoof mode](/CERTCC/PoC-Exploits/raw/master/cve-2020-10136/spoof.png)](/CERTCC/PoC-Exploits/blob/master/cve-2020-10136/spoof.png)

The demonstration script can be used in two ways - spoof mode and
bypass mode. Initial setup requires at least three devices for this
testing. In the simple spoofing mode, attacker will send a IP-in-IP
packet from their device to a vulnerable machine
(VULNERABLE\_MACHINE\_IP sys.argv[1]) to replay a packet to the victim's
device (VICTIM\_IP sys.argv[2]). This mode demonstrates a DDOS
capability to send unsolicited traffic to VICTIM\_IP. Because this
packet has valid source and destination, anti-spoofing measure such as
BCP-38 will not block this crafted packet. The intended traffic can be
routed through the VULNERABLE\_IP to the VICTIM\_IP device by an
unauthenticated attacker.

Bypass mode:

[![Bypass mode](/CERTCC/PoC-Exploits/raw/master/cve-2020-10136/bypass.png)](/CERTCC/PoC-Exploits/blob/master/cve-2020-10136/bypass.png)

In the bypass mode (using all 4 arguments for the script), the
attacker will send a crafted IP-in-IP packet from the attacker's
device to a vulnerable device (VULNERABLE\_MACHINE\_IP sys.argv[1]). The
vulnerable device will receive and decapsulate the packet and forward
the inner IP packet to the victim device (VICTIM\_IP sys.argv[2])
machine with a source IP Address of DATA\_COLLECT\_IP (sys.argv[3]). The
attacker can thus solicit information using the sample SNMP query to
be sent to DATA\_COLLECT\_IP which he has access to. In the provided
example, device at the VICTIM\_IP address is assumed to have SNMP
enabled with the standard "public" community string for read-only
access. SNMP is being demonstrated here, but this forwarding behavior
can allow for many types of unexpected IP traffic to traverse using
the vulnerable machine as a forwarding point for any nefarious
communications as planned by the attacker.

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

[1](#section-1).  Introduction

   With NAT devices becoming increasingly more prevalent, there have
   recently been many tunneling protocols developed that go through NAT
   devices or firewalls by tunneling over UDP or TCP.  For example,
   Teredo [[RFC4380](/doc/html/rfc4380 "\"Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through Network Address Translations (NATs)\"")], Layer Two Tunneling Protocol Version 2 (L2TPv2)
   [[RFC2661](/doc/html/rfc2661 "\"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol \"")], and Layer Two Tunneling Protocol Version 3 (L2TPv3)
   [[RFC3931](/doc/html/rfc3931 "\"Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3)\"")] all tunnel IP packets over UDP.  Similarly, many Secure
   Socket Layer (SSL) VPN solutions that tunnel IP packets over HTTP
   (and hence over TCP) are deployed today.

   This document discusses security concerns with tunneling IP packets
   and includes recommendations where relevant.

   The primary intent of this document is to help improve security
   deployments using tunnel protocols.  In addition, the document aims
   to provide information that can be used in any new or updated tunnel
   protocol specification.  The intended audience of this document
   includes network administrators and future protocol developers.

[2](#section-2).  Tunnels May Bypass Security

[2.1](#section-2.1).  Network Security Bypass

[2.1.1](#section-2.1.1).  Problem

   Tunneled IP traffic may not receive the intended level of inspection
   or policy application by network-based security devices unless such
   devices are specifically tunnel aware.  This reduces defense in depth
   and may cause security gaps.  This applies to all network-located
   devices and to any end-host-based firewalls whose existing hooking
   mechanism(s) would not show them the IP packet stream after the
   tunnel client does decapsulation or before it does encapsulation.

[2.1.2](#section-2.1.2).  Discussion

   Evasion by tunneling is often a problem for network-based security
   devices such as network firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention
   systems, and router controls.  To provide such functionality in the
   presence of tunnels, the developer of such devices must add support
   for parsing each new protocol.  There is typically a significant lag
   between when the security developer recognizes that a tunnel will be
   used (or will be remotely usable) to a significant degree and when
   the parsing can be implemented in a product update, the update can be
   tested and released, and customers can begin using the update.  Late
   changes in the protocol specification or in the way it is implemented
   can cause additional delays.  This becomes a significant security
   concern when a delay in applied coverage is occurring frequently.

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   One way to cut down on this lag is for security developers to follow
   the progress of new IETF protocols, but this will still not account
   for any new proprietary protocols.

   For example, for L2TP or Teredo, an unaware network security device
   would inspect or regulate the outer IP and the IP-based UDP layer as
   normal, but it would not recognize that there is an additional IP
   layer contained inside the UDP payload to which it needs to apply the
   same controls as it would to a native packet.  (Of course, if the
   device discards the packet due to something in the IP or UDP header,
   such as referring to an unknown protocol, the embedded packet is no
   longer a concern.)  In addition, if the tunnel does encryption, the
   network-based security device may not be able to do much, just as if
   IPsec end-to-end encryption were used without tunneling.

   Network security controls not being applied must be a concern to
   those that set them up, since those controls are supposed to provide
   an additional layer of defense against external attackers.  If
   network controls are being bypassed due to the use of tunneling, the
   strength of the defense (i.e., the number of layers of defense) is
   reduced.  Since security administrators may have a significantly
   reduced level of confidence without this layer, this becomes a
   concern to them.

   One implication of the security control bypass is that defense in
   depth has been reduced, perhaps down to zero unless a local firewall
   is in use as recommended in [[RFC4380](/doc/html/rfc4380 "\"Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through Network Address Translations (NATs)\"")].  However, even if there are
   host-based security controls that recognize tunnels and all controls
   that were maintained by the network are available on the host,
   security administrators may not have configured them with full
   security control parity.  Thus, there may be gaps in desired
   coverage.

   Compounding this is that, unlike what would be the case for native
   IP, some network administrators will not even be aware that their
   hosts are globally reachable if the tunnel provides connectivity
   to/from the Internet; for example, they may not be expecting this for
   hosts behind a stateful firewall.  In addition, [Section 3.2](#section-3.2) discusses
   how it may not be efficient to find all tunneled traffic for network
   devices to examine.

[2.1.3](#section-2.1.3).  Recommendations

   Security administrators who do not consider tunneling an acceptable
   risk should disable tunnel functionality either on the end nodes
   (hosts) or on the network nodes at the perimeter of their network.
   However, there may be an awareness gap.  Thus, due to the possible
   negative security consequences, tunneling functionality should be

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   easy to disable on the host and through a central management facility
   if one is provided.

   To minimize security exposure due to tunnels, we recommend that a
   tunnel be an interface of last resort, independent of IP version.
   Specifically, we suggest that when both native and tunneled access to
   a remote host is available, the native access be used in preference
   to tunneled access except when the tunnel endpoint is known to not
   bypass security (e.g., an IPsec tunnel to a gateway provided by the
   security administrator of the network).  This should also promote
   greater efficiency and reliability.

   Note that although Rule 7 of [[RFC3484], SectionÂ 6](/doc/html/rfc3484#section-6) will prefer native
   connectivity over tunnels, this rule is only a tie-breaker when a
   choice is not made by earlier rules; hence, tunneling mechanisms that
   are tied to a particular range of IP address space will be decided
   based on the prefix precedence.  For example, using the prefix policy
   mechanism of [[RFC3484], SectionÂ 2.1](/doc/html/rfc3484#section-2.1), Teredo might have a precedence
   of 5 so that native IPv4 is preferred over Teredo.

[2.2](#section-2.2).  IP Ingress and Egress Filtering Bypass

[2.2.1](#section-2.2.1).  Problem

   IP addresses inside tunnels are not subject to ingress and egress
   filtering in the network they tunnel over, unless extraordinary
   measures are taken.  Only the tunnel endpoints can do such filtering.

[2.2.2](#section-2.2.2).  Discussion

   Ingress filtering (sanity-checking incoming destination addresses)
   and egress filtering (sanity-checking outgoing source addresses) are
   done to mitigate attacks and to make it easier to identify the source
   of a packet and are considered to be a good practice.  For example,
   ingress filtering at the network perimeter should not allow packets
   with a source address that belongs to the network to enter the
   network from outside the network.  This function is most naturally
   (and in the general case, by requirement) done at network boundaries.
   Tunneled IP traffic bypassing this network control is a specific case
   of [Section 2.1](#section-2.1), but is illustrative.

[2.2.3](#section-2.2.3).  Recommendations

   Tunnel servers can apply ingress and egress controls to tunneled IP
   addresses passing through them to and from tunnel clients.

   Tunnel clients could make an effort to conduct ingress and egress
   filtering.

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   Implementations of protocols that embed an IPv4 address in a tunneled
   IPv6 address directly between peers should perform filtering based on
   checking the correspondence.

   Implementations of protocols that accept tunneled packets directly
   from a server, relay, or protocol peer do filtering the same way as
   it would be done on a native link with traffic from a router.

   Some protocols such as 6to4 [[RFC3056](/doc/html/rfc3056 "\"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds\"")], Teredo, and the Intra-Site
   Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) [[RFC5214](/doc/html/rfc5214 "\"Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)\"")] allow both
   other hosts and a router over a common tunnel.  To perform host-based
   filtering with such protocols, a host would need to know the outer IP
   address of each router from which it could receive traffic, so that
   packets from hosts beyond the router will be accepted even though the
   source address would not embed the router's IP address.  Router
   addresses might be learned via SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)
   [[RFC3971](/doc/html/rfc3971 "\"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)\"")] or some other mechanism (e.g., [[RFC5214], SectionÂ 8.3.2](/doc/html/rfc5214#section-8.3.2)).

[2.3](#section-2.3).  Source Routing after the Tunnel Client

[2.3.1](#section-2.3.1).  Problem

   If the encapsulated IP packet specifies source routing beyond the
   recipient tunnel client, the host may forward the IP packet to the
   specified next hop.  This may be unexpected and contrary to
   administrator wishes and may have bypassed network-based source-
   routing controls.

[2.3.2](#section-2.3.2).  Discussion

   A detailed discussion of issues related to source routing can be
   found in [[RFC5095](/doc/html/rfc5095 "\"Deprecation of Type 0 Routing Headers in IPv6\"")] and [[SECA-IP](#ref-SECA-IP "\"Security Assessment of the Internet Protocol version 4\"")].

[2.3.3](#section-2.3.3).  Recommendations

   Tunnel clients should by default discard tunneled IP packets that
   specify additional routing, as recommended in [[RFC5095](/doc/html/rfc5095 "\"Deprecation of Type 0 Routing Headers in IPv6\"")] and
   [[SECA-IP](#ref-SECA-IP "\"Security Assessment of the Internet Protocol version 4\"")], though they may also allow the user to configure what
   source-routing types are allowed.  All pre-existing source-routing
   controls should be upgraded to apply these controls to tunneled IP
   packets as well.

[3](#section-3).  Challenges in Inspecting and Filtering Content of Tunneled Data
    Packets

[3.1](#section-3.1).  Inefficiency of Selective Network Filtering of All Tunneled
      Packets

[3.1.1](#section-3.1.1).  Problem

   There is no mechanism that both efficiently and immediately filters
   all tunneled packets (other than the obviously faulty method of
   filtering all packets).  This limits the ability to prevent tunnel
   use on a network.

[3.1.2](#section-3.1.2).  Discussion

   Given concerns about tunnel security or a network's lack of
   preparedness for tunnels, a network administrator may wish to simply
   block all use of tunnels that bypass security policies.  He or she
   may wish to do so using network controls; this could be either due to
   not having the capability to disable tunneling on all hosts attached
   to the network or due to wanting an extra layer of prevention.

   One simple method of doing this easily for many tunnel protocols is
   to block outbound packets to the UDP or TCP port used (e.g.,
   destination UDP port is 3544 for Teredo, UDP port 1701 for L2TP,
   etc.).  This prevents a tunnel client from establishing a new tunnel.
   However, existing tunnels will not necessarily be affected if the
   blocked port is used only for initial setup.  In addition, if the
   blocking is applied on the outside of the client's NAT device, the
   NAT device will retain the port mapping for the client.  In some
   cases, however, blocking all traffic to a given outbound port (e.g.,
   port 80) may interfere with non-tunneled traffic so this should be
   used with caution.

   Another simple alternative, if the tunnel server addresses are well-
   known, is to filter out all traffic to/from such addresses.

   The other approach is to find all packets to block in the same way as
   would be done for inspecting all packets ([Section 3.2](#section-3.2)).  However,
   this presents difficulties in terms of efficiency of filtering, as is
   discussed in [Section 3.2](#section-3.2).

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

[3.1.3](#section-3.1.3).  Recommendations

   Developers of protocols that tunnel over UDP or TCP (including HTTP)
   to reach the Internet should disable their protocols in networks that
   wish to enforce security policies on the user traffic.  (Windows, for
   example, disables Teredo by default if it detects that it is within
   an enterprise network that contains a Windows domain controller.)

   Administrators of such networks may wish to filter all tunneled
   traffic at the boundaries of their networks.  It is sufficient to
   filter out the tunneled connection requests (if they can be
   identified) to stop further tunneled traffic.  The easiest mechanism
   for this would be to filter out outgoing traffic sent to the
   destination port defined by the tunneling protocol and incoming
   traffic with that source port.  Similarly, in certain cases, it is
   also possible to use the IP protocol field to identify and filter
   tunneled packets.  For example, 6to4 [[RFC3056](/doc/html/rfc3056 "\"Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds\"")] is a tunneling
   mechanism that uses IPv4 packets to carry encapsulated IPv6 packets
   and can be identified by the IPv4 protocol type 41.

[3.2](#section-3.2).  Problems with Deep Packet Inspection of Tunneled Data Packets

[3.2.1](#section-3.2.1).  Problem

   There is no efficient mechanism for network-based devices, which are
   not the tunnel endpoint, to inspect the contents of all tunneled data
   packets the way they can for native packets.  This makes it difficult
   to apply the same controls as they do to native IP.

[3.2.2](#section-3.2.2).  Discussion

   Some tunnel protocols are easy to identify, such as if all data
   packets are encapsulated using a well-known UDP or TCP port that is
   unique to the protocol.

   Other protocols, however, either use dynamic ports for data traffic
   or else share ports with other protocols (e.g., tunnels over HTTP).

   The implication of this is that network-based devices that wish to
   passively inspect (and perhaps selectively apply policy to) all
   encapsulated traffic must inspect all TCP or UDP packets (or at least
   all packets not part of a session that is known not to be a tunnel).
   This is imperfect since a heuristic must then be applied to determine
   if a packet is indeed part of a tunnel.  This may be too slow to make
   use of in practice, especially if it means that all TCP or UDP
   packets must be taken off of the device's "fast path".

```

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   One heuristic that can be used on packets to determine if they are
   tunnel-related or not is as follows.  For each known tunnel protocol,
   attempt parsing the packet as if it were a packet of that protocol
   destined to the local host (i.e., where the local host has the
   destination address in the inner IP header, if any).  If all syntax
   checks pass, up to and including the inner IP header (if the tunnel
   does not use encryption), then treat the packet as if it were a
   tunneled packet of that protocol.

   It is possible that non-tunneled packets will be treated as if they
   were tunneled packets using this heuristic, but tunneled packets (of
   the known types of tunnels) should not escape inspection, absent
   implementation bugs.

   For some protocols, it may be possible to monitor setup exchanges to
   know to expect that data will be exchanged on certain ports later.
   (Note that this does not necessarily apply to Teredo, for example,
   since communicating with another Teredo client behind a cone NAT
   [[RFC5389](/doc/html/rfc5389 "\"Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)\"")] device does not require such signaling.  In such cases this
   control will not work.  However, deprecation of the cone bit as
   discussed in [[RFC5991](/doc/html/rfc5991 "\"Teredo Security Updates\"")] means this technique may indeed work with
   updated Teredo implementations.)

[3.2.3](#section-3.2.3).  Recommendations

   As illustrated above, it should be clear that inspecting the contents
   of tunneled data packets is highly complex and often impractical.
   For this reason, if a network wishes to monitor IP traffic, tunneling
   across, as opposed to tunneling to, the security boundary is not
   recommended.  For example, to provide an IPv6 transition solution,
   the network should provide native IPv6 connectivity or a tunnel
   solution (e.g., ISATAP or 6over4 [[RFC2529](/doc/html/rfc2529 "\"Transmission of IPv6 over IPv4 Domains without Explicit Tunnels\"")]) that encapsulates data
   packets between hosts and a router within the network.

[4](#section-4).  Increased Exposure Due to Tunneling

[4.1](#section-4.1).  NAT Holes Increase Attack Surface

[4.1.1](#section-4.1.1).  Problem

   If the tunnel allows inbound access from the public Internet, the
   opening created in a NAT device due to a tunnel client increases its
   Internet attack surface area.  If vulnerabilities are present, this
   increased exposure can be used by attackers and their programs.

```

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   If the tunnel allows inbound access only from a private network
   (e.g., a remote network to which one has VPNed), the opening created
   in the NAT device still increases its attack surface area, although
   not as much as in the public Internet case.

[4.1.2](#section-4.1.2).  Discussion

   When a tunnel is active, a mapped port is maintained on the NAT
   device through which remote hosts can send packets and perhaps
   establish connections.  The following sequence is intended to sketch
   out the processing on the tunnel client host that can be reached
   through this mapped port; the actual processing for a given host may
   be somewhat different.

   1.  Link-layer protocol processing

   2.  (Outer) IP host firewall processing

   3.  (Outer) IP processing by stack

   4.  UDP/TCP processing by stack

   5.  Tunnel client processing

   6.  (Inner) IP host firewall processing

   7.  (Inner) IP processing by stack

   8.  Various upper layer processing may follow

   The inner firewall (and other security) processing may or may not be
   present, but if it is, some of the inner IP processing may be
   filtered.  (For example, [[RFC4380], SectionÂ 7.1](/doc/html/rfc4380#section-7.1) recommends that an
   IPv6 host firewall be used on all Teredo clients.)

   (By the virtue of the tunnel being active, we can infer that the
   inner host firewall is unlikely to do any filtering based on the
   outer IP.)  Any of this processing may expose vulnerabilities an
   attacker can exploit; similarly, these may expose information to an
   attacker.  Thus, even if firewall filtering is in place (as is
   prudent) and filters all incoming packets, the exposed area is larger
   than if a native IP Internet connection were in place, due to the
   processing that takes place before the inner IP is reached
   (specifically, the UDP/TCP processing, the tunnel client processing,
   and additional IP processing, especially if one is IPv4 and the other
   is IPv6).

```

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   One possibility is that a layer 3 (L3) targeted worm makes use of a
   vulnerability in the exposed processing.  The main benefit tunneling
   provides to worms is enabling L3 reachability to the end host.  Even
   a thoroughly firewalled host could be subject to a worm that spreads
   with a single UDP packet if the right remote code vulnerability is
   present.

[4.1.3](#section-4.1.3).  Recommendation

   This problem seems inherent in tunneling being active on a host, so
   the solution seems to be to minimize tunneling use.

   For example, tunneling can be active only when it is really needed
   and only for as long as needed.  So, the tunnel interface can be
   initially not configured and only used when it is entirely the last
   resort.  The interface should then be deactivated (ideally,
   automatically) again as soon as possible.  Note, however, that the
   hole will remain in the NAT device for some amount of time after
   this, so some processing of incoming packets is inevitable unless the
   client's native IP address behind the NAT device is changed.

[4.2](#section-4.2).  Exposure of a NAT Hole

[4.2.1](#section-4.2.1).  Problem

   Attackers are more likely to know about a tunnel client's NAT hole
   than a typical hole in the NAT device.  If they know about the hole,
   they could try to use it.

[4.2.2](#section-4.2.2).  Discussion

   There are at least three reasons why an attacker may be more likely
   to learn of the tunnel client's exposed port than a typical NAT
   exposed port:

   1.  The NAT mapping for a tunnel is typically held open for a
       significant period of time and kept stable.  This increases the
       chance of it being discovered.

   2.  In some protocols (e.g., Teredo), the external IP address and
       port are contained in the client's address that is used end-to-
       end and possibly even advertised in a name resolution system.
       While the tunnel protocol itself might only distribute this
       address in IP headers, peers, routers, and other on-path nodes
       still see the client's IP address.  Although this point does not
       apply directly to protocols that do not construct the inner IP
       address based on the outer IP address (e.g., L2TP), the inner IP

```

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

       address is still known to peers, routers, etc., and can still be
       reached by attackers without their knowing the external IP
       address or port.

   3.  Sending packets over a tunnel often results in more message
       exchanges due to the tunneling protocol, as well as messages
       being seen by more parties (e.g., due to a longer path length),
       than sending packets natively, offering more chances for
       visibility into the port and address in use.

[4.2.3](#section-4.2.3).  Recommendation

   The recommendation from [Section 4.1](#section-4.1) seems to apply here as well:
   minimize tunnel use.

[4.3](#section-4.3).  Public Tunnels Widen Holes in Restricted NATs

[4.3.1](#section-4.3.1).  Problem

   Tunnels that allow inbound connectivity from the Internet (e.g.,
   Teredo, tunnel brokers, etc.) essentially disable the filtering
   behavior of the NAT for all tunnel client ports.  This eliminates NAT
   devices filtering for such ports and may eliminate the need for an
   attacker to spoof an address.

[4.3.2](#section-4.3.2).  Discussion

   NATs that implement Address-Dependent or Address and Port-Dependent
   Filtering [[RFC4787](/doc/html/rfc4787 "\"Network Address Translation (NAT) Behavioral Requirements for Unicast UDP\"")] limit the source of incoming packets to just
   those that are a previous destination.  This poses a problem for
   tunnels that intend to allow inbound connectivity from the Internet.

   Various protocols (e.g., Teredo, Session Traversal Utilities for NAT
   (STUN) [[RFC5389](/doc/html/rfc5389 "\"Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)\"")], etc.) provide a facility for peers, upon request,
   to become a previous destination.  This works by sending a "bubble"
   packet via a server, which is passed to the client and then sent by
   the client (through the NAT) to the originator.

   This removes any NAT-based barrier to attackers sending packets in
   through the client's service port.  In particular, an attacker would
   no longer need to either be an actual previous destination or forge
   its addresses as a previous destination.  When forging, the attacker
   would have had to learn of a previous destination and then would face
   more challenges in seeing any returned traffic.

[4.3.3](#section-4.3.3).  Recommendations

   If the tunnel can provide connectivity to the Internet, the tunnel
   client should run a host firewall on the tunnel interface.  Also,
   minimizing public tunnel use (see [Section 4.1.3](#section-4.1.3)) would lower the
   attack opportunity related to this exposure.

[5](#section-5).  Tunnel Address Concerns

[5.1](#section-5.1).  Feasibility of Guessing Tunnel Addresses

[5.1.1](#section-5.1.1).  Problem

   For some types of tunneling protocols, it may be feasible to guess IP
   addresses assigned to tunnels, either when looking for a specific
   client or when looking for an arbitrary client.  This is in contrast
   to native IPv6 addresses in general but is no worse than for native
   IPv4 addresses today.

   For example, some protocols (e.g., 6to4 and Teredo) use well-defined
   address ranges.  As another example, using well-known public servers
   for Teredo or tunnel brokers also implies using a well-known address
   range.

[5.1.2](#section-5.1.2).  Discussion

   Several tunnel protocols use endpoint addresses that can be
   algorithmically derived from some known values.  These addresses are
   structured, and the fields contained in them can be fairly
   predictable.  This reduces the search space for an attacker and
   reduces the resistance of the address to scanning attacks.

[5.1.3](#section-5.1.3).  Recommendations

   It is recommended that tunnel protocol developers use tunnel endpoint
   addresses that are not easily guessable.  When the tunnel endpoint
   addresses are structured and fairly guessable, it is recommended that
   the implementation use any unused fields in the address to provide
   additional entropy to the address in order to reduce the address-
   scanning risks.  For example, this could be done by setting these
   unused fields to some random values.

[5.2](#section-5.2).  Profiling Targets Based on Tunnel Address

[5.2.1](#section-5.2.1).  Problem

   An attacker encountering an address associated with a particular
   tunneling protocol or well-known tunnel server has the opportunity to
   infer certain relevant pieces of information that can be used to
   profile the host before sending any packets.  This can reduce the
   attacker's footprint and increase the attacker's efficiency.

[5.2.2](#section-5.2.2).  Discussion

   The tunnel address reveals some information about the nature of the
   client:

   o  That a host has a tunnel address associated with a given protocol
      means that the client is running on some platform for which there
      exists a tunnel client implementation of that protocol.  In
      addition, if some platforms have that protocol installed by
      default and if the host's default rules for using it make it
      susceptible to being in use, then the protocol is more likely to
      be running on such a platform than on one where it is not used by
      default.  For example, as of this writing, seeing a Teredo address
      suggests that the host it is on is probably running Windows.

   o  Similarly, the use of an address associated with a particular
      tunnel server also suggests some information.  Tunnel client
      software is often deployed, installed, and/or configured using
      some degree of automation.  It seems likely that the majority of
      the time, the tunnel server that results from the initial
      configuration will go unchanged from the initial setting.
      Moreover, the server that is configured for use may be associated
      with a particular means of installation, which often suggests the
      platform.  For example, if the server field in a Teredo address is
      one of the IPv4 addresses to which teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com
      resolves, the host is likely running Windows.

   o  The external IPv4 address of a NAT device can, of course, be
      readily associated with a particular organization or at least an
      ISP; hence, putting this address in an IPv6 address reveals this
      information.  However, this is no different than using a native IP
      address and is therefore not new with tunneling.

   o  It is also possible that external client port numbers may be more
      often associated with particular client software or the platform
      on which it is running.  The usefulness of this for platform
      determination is, however, reduced by the different NAT port

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

      number assignment behaviors.  In addition, the same observations
      would apply to use of UDP or TCP over native IP as well; hence,
      this is not new with tunneling.

   The platform, tunnel client software, or organization information can
   be used by an attacker to target attacks more carefully.  For
   example, an attacker may decide to attack an address only if it is
   likely to be associated with a particular platform or tunnel client
   software with a known vulnerability.  (This is similar to the ability
   to guess some platforms based on the Organizationally Unique
   Identifier (OUI) in the Extended Unique Identifier (EUI)-64 portion
   of an IPv6 address generated from a Media Access Control (MAC)
   address, since some platforms are commonly used with interface cards
   from particular vendors.)

[5.2.3](#section-5.2.3).  Recommendations

   If installation programs randomize the server setting, they would
   reduce the extent to which they can be profiled.  Similarly,
   administrators can choose to change the default setting to reduce the
   degree to which they can be profiled ahead of time.

   Randomizing the tunnel client port in use would mitigate any
   profiling that can be done based on the external port, especially if
   multiple tunnel clients did this.  Further discussion on randomizing
   ports can be found at [[RFC6056](/doc/html/rfc6056 "\"Recommendations for Transport- Protocol Port Randomization\"")].

   It is recommended that tunnel protocols minimize the propagation of
   knowledge about whether the NAT is a cone NAT.

[6](#section-6).  Additional Security Concerns

[6.1](#section-6.1).  Attacks Facilitated by Changing Tunnel Server Setting

[6.1.1](#section-6.1.1).  Problem

   If an attacker could change either a tunnel client's server setting
   or the IP addresses to which a configured host name resolves (e.g.,
   by intercepting DNS queries) AND if the tunnel is not authenticated,
   the attacker would become a man in the middle.  This would allow them
   to at least monitor peer communication and at worst to impersonate
   the remote peer.

[6.1.2](#section-6.1.2).  Discussion

   A client's server has good visibility into the client's communication
   with IP peers.  If the server were switched to one that records this
   information and makes it available to third parties (e.g.,

Krishnan, et al.             Informational                     [Page 15]

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   advertisers, competitors, spouses, etc.), then sensitive information
   would be disclosed, especially if the client's host prefers the
   tunnel over native IP.  Assuming the server provides good service,
   the user would not have reason to suspect the change.

   Full interception of IP traffic could also be arranged (including
   pharming), which would allow any number of deception or monitoring
   attacks, including phishing.  We illustrate this with an example
   phishing attack scenario.

   It is often assumed that the tunnel server is a trusted entity.  It
   may be possible for malware or a malicious user to quietly change the
   client's tunnel server setting and have the user be unaware that
   their trust has been misplaced for an indefinite period of time.
   However, malware or a malicious user can do much worse than this, so
   this is not a significant concern.  Hence, it is only important that
   an attacker on the network cannot change the client's server setting.

   1.  A phisher sets up a malicious tunnel server (or tampers with a
       legitimate one).  This server, for the most part, provides
       correct service.

   2.  An attacker, by some means, switches the host's tunnel server
       setting or spoofs a DNS reply to point to the above server.  If
       neither DNS nor the tunnel setup is secured (i.e., if the client
       does not authenticate the information), then the attacker's
       tunnel server is seen as legitimate.

   3.  A user on the victim host types their bank's URL into his/her
       browser.

   4.  The bank's hostname resolves to one or more IP addresses, and the
       tunnel is selected for socket connection for whatever reason
       (e.g., the tunnel provides IPv6 connectivity, and the bank has an
       IPv6 address).

   5.  The tunnel client uses the server for help in connecting to the
       bank's IP address.  Some tunneling protocols use a separate
       channel for signaling versus data, but this still allows the
       server to place itself in the data path by an appropriate signal
       to the client.  For example, in Teredo, the client sends a ping
       request through a server, which is expected to come back through
       a data relay, and a malicious server can simply send it back
       itself to indicate that is a data relay for the communication.

[RFC 6169](/doc/html/rfc6169)               Tunneling Security Concerns            April 2011

   6.  The rest works pretty much like any normal phishing transaction,
       except that the attacker acts as a tunnel server (or data relay,
       for protocols such as Teredo) and a host with the bank's IP
       address.

   This pharming-type attack is not unique to tunneling.  Switching DNS
   server settings to a malicious DNS server or DNS cache poisoning in a
   recursive DNS resolver could have a similar effect.

[6.1.3](#section-6.1.3).  Recommendations

   In general, anti-phishing and anti-fraud provisions should help with
   aspects of this, as well as software that specifically monitors for
   tunnel server changes.

   Perhaps the best way to mitigate tunnel-specific attacks is to have
   the client authenticate either the tunnel server or at least the
   means by which the tunnel server's IP address is determined.  For
   example, SSL VPNs use https URLs and hence authenticate the server as
   being the expected one.  When IPv6 Router Advertisements are sent
   over the tunnel, another mechanism is to use SEcure Neighbor
   Discovery (SEND) [[RFC3971](/doc/html/rfc3971 "\"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)\"")] to verify that the client trusts the
   server.

   On the host, it should require an appropriate level of privilege in
   order to change the tunnel server setting (as well as other non-
   tunnel-specific settings such as the DNS server setting, etc.).
   Making it easy to see the current tunnel server setting (e.g., not
   requiring privilege for this) should help detection of changes.

   The scope of the attack can also be reduced by limiting tunneling use
   in general but especially in preferring native IPv4 to tunneled IPv6
   when connecting to peers who are accessible over IPv4, as doing so
   helps mitigate attacks that are facilitated by changing the tunnel
   server setting.  Please refer to Section 3 of [[TUNNEL-LOOPS](#ref-TUNNEL-LOOPS)] for a
   detailed description and mitigation measures for a class of attacks
   based on IPv6 automatic tunnels.

[7](#section-7).  Mechanisms to Secure the Use of Tunnels

   This document described several security issues with tunnels.  This
   does not mean that tunnels need to be avoided at any cost.  On the
   contrary, tunnels can be very useful if deployed, operated, and used
   properly.  The threats against IP tunnels are documented here.  If
   the threats can be mitigated, network administrators can efficiently
   and securely use tunnels in their network.  Several measures can be
   taken in order to secure the operation of IPv6 tunnels:

## IP-in-IP protocol routes arbitrary traffic by default

#### Vulnerability Note VU#636397

Original Release Date: 2020-06-02 | Last Revised: 2020-09-30

---

### Overview

IP Encapsulation within IP (RFC2003 IP-in-IP) can be abused by an unauthenticated attacker to unexpectedly route arbitrary network traffic through a vulnerable device.

### Description

IP-in-IP encapsulation is a tunneling protocol specified in RFC 2003 that allows for IP packets to be encapsulated inside another IP packets. This is very similar to IPSEC VPNs in tunnel mode, except in the case of IP-in-IP, the traffic is unencrypted. As specified, the protocol unwraps the inner IP packet and forwards this packet through IP routing tables, potentially providing unexpected access to network paths available to the vulnerable device. An IP-in-IP device is considered to be vulnerable if it accepts IP-in-IP packets from any source to any destination without explicit configuration between the specified source and destination IP addresses. This unexpected Data Processing Error (CWE-19) by a vulnerable device can be abused to perform reflective DDoS and in certain scenarios used to bypass network access control lists. Because the forwarded network packet may not be inspected or verified by vulnerable devices, there are possibly other unexpected behaviors that can be abused by an attacker on the target device or the target device's network environment.

### Impact

An unauthenticated attacker can route network traffic through a vulnerable device, which may lead to reflective DDoS, information leak and bypass of network access controls.

### Solution

#### Apply updates

The CERT/CC recommends that you apply the latest patch provided by the affected vendor that addresses this issue. Review the vendor information below or contact your vendor or supplier for specific mitigation advice. If a device has the ability to disable IP-in-IP in its configuration, it is recommended that you disable IP-in-IP in all interfaces that do not require this feature. Device manufacturers are urged to disable IP-in-IP in their default configuration and to require their customers to explicitly configure IP-in-IP as and when needed.

#### Disable IP-in-IP

Users can block IP-in-IP packets by filtering IP protocol number 4. Note this filtering is for the IPv4 Protocol (or IPv6 Next Header) field value of 4 and *not* IP protocol version 4 (IPv4).

#### Proof of Concept (PoC)

A proof-of-concept originally written by Yannay Livneh is [available](https://github.com/CERTCC/PoC-Exploits/tree/master/cve-2020-10136) in the CERT/CC PoC respository.

#### Detection Signature (IDS)

This Snort IDS rule looks for any IP-in-IP traffic, whether intentional or not seen at upstream network path of a vulnerable device. This Snort or Suricata rule can be modified to apply filters that ignore sources and destinations that are allowed by policy to route IP-in-IP traffic.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator: Â  Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV:Â Local AV:Â Adjacent AV:Â Network AV:Â Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC:Â Low AC:Â High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR:Â None PR:Â Low PR:Â High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI:Â Required UI:Â None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S:Â Unchanged S:Â Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C:Â None C:Â Low C:Â High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I:Â None I:Â Low I:Â High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A:Â None A:Â Low A:Â High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E:Â Unproven  E:Â Proof-of-Concept  E:Â Functional  E:Â High  E:Â Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL:Â Official-Fix  RL:Â Temporary-Fix  RL:Â Workaround  RL:Â Unavailable  RL:Â Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC:Â Unknown  RC:Â Reasonable  RC:Â Confirmed  RC:Â Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR:Â Low  CR:Â Medium  CR:Â Not Defined  CR:Â High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR:Â Low  IR:Â Medium  IR:Â Not Defined  IR:Â High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR:Â Low  AR:Â Medium  AR:Â Not Defined  AR:Â High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV:Â Local  MAV:Â Adjacent  MAV:Â Network  MAV:Â Physical  MAV:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC:Â Low  MAC:Â High  MAC:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR:Â None  MPR:Â Low  MPR:Â High  MPR:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI:Â Required  MUI:Â None  MUI:Â Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS:Â Unchanged  MS:Â Changed  MS:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC:Â None  MC:Â Low  MC:Â High  MC:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI:Â None  MI:Â Low  MI:Â High  MI:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA:Â None  MA:Â Low  MA:Â High  MA:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.6 |

                       IP Encapsulation within IP

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document specifies a method by which an IP datagram may be
   encapsulated (carried as payload) within an IP datagram.
   Encapsulation is suggested as a means to alter the normal IP routing
   for datagrams, by delivering them to an intermediate destination that
   would otherwise not be selected by the (network part of the) IP
   Destination Address field in the original IP header.  Encapsulation
   may serve a variety of purposes, such as delivery of a datagram to a
   mobile node using Mobile IP.

[1](#section-1). Introduction

   This document specifies a method by which an IP datagram may be
   encapsulated (carried as payload) within an IP datagram.
   Encapsulation is suggested as a means to alter the normal IP routing
   for datagrams, by delivering them to an intermediate destination that
   would otherwise not be selected based on the (network part of the) IP
   Destination Address field in the original IP header.  Once the
   encapsulated datagram arrives at this intermediate destination node,
   it is decapsulated, yielding the original IP datagram, which is then
   delivered to the destination indicated by the original Destination
   Address field.  This use of encapsulation and decapsulation of a
   datagram is frequently referred to as "tunneling" the datagram, and
   the encapsulator and decapsulator are then considered to be the
   "endpoints" of the tunnel.

   In the most general tunneling case we have

      source ---> encapsulator --------> decapsulator ---> destination

   with the source, encapsulator, decapsulator, and destination being
   separate nodes.  The encapsulator node is considered the "entry

```

[RFC 2003](/doc/html/rfc2003)                      IP-within-IP                  October 1996

   point" of the tunnel, and the decapsulator node is considered the
   "exit point" of the tunnel.  There in general may be multiple
   source-destination pairs using the same tunnel between the
   encapsulator and decapsulator.

[2](#section-2). Motivation

   The Mobile IP working group has specified the use of encapsulation as
   a way to deliver datagrams from a mobile node's "home network" to an
   agent that can deliver datagrams locally by conventional means to the
   mobile node at its current location away from home [[8](#ref-8)].  The use of
   encapsulation may also be desirable whenever the source (or an
   intermediate router) of an IP datagram must influence the route by
   which a datagram is to be delivered to its ultimate destination.
   Other possible applications of encapsulation include multicasting,
   preferential billing, choice of routes with selected security
   attributes, and general policy routing.

   It is generally true that encapsulation and the IP loose source
   routing option [[10](#ref-10)] can be used in similar ways to affect the routing
   of a datagram, but there are several technical reasons to prefer
   encapsulation:

    -  There are unsolved security problems associated with the use of
       the IP source routing options.

    -  Current Internet routers exhibit performance problems when
       forwarding datagrams that contain IP options, including the IP
       source routing options.

    -  Many current Internet nodes process IP source routing options
       incorrectly.

    -  Firewalls may exclude IP source-routed datagrams.

    -  Insertion of an IP source route option may complicate the
       processing of authentication information by the source and/or
       destination of a datagram, depending on how the authentication is
       specified to be performed.

    -  It is considered impolite for intermediate routers to make
       modifications to datagrams which they did not originate.

   These technical advantages must be weighed against the disadvantages
   posed by the use of encapsulation:

    -  Encapsulated datagrams typically are larger than source routed
       datagrams.

Perkins                     Standards Track                     [Page 2]

[RFC 2003](/doc/html/rfc2003)                      IP-within-IP                  October 1996

    -  Encapsulation cannot be used unless it is known in advance that
       the node at the tunnel exit point can decapsulate the datagram.

   Since the majority of Internet nodes today do not perform well when
   IP loose source route options are used, the second technical
   disadvantage of encapsulation is not as serious as it might seem at
   first.

[3](#section-3). IP in IP Encapsulation

   To encapsulate an IP datagram using IP in IP encapsulation, an outer
   IP header [[10](#ref-10)] is inserted before the datagram's existing IP header,
   as follows:

                                         +---------------------------+
                                         |                           |
                                         |      Outer IP Header      |
                                         |                           |
     +---------------------------+       +---------------------------+
     |                           |       |                           |
     |         IP Header         |       |         IP Header         |
     |                           |       |                           |
     +---------------------------+ ====> +---------------------------+
     |                           |       |                           |
     |                           |       |                           |
     |         IP Payload        |       |         IP Payload        |
     |                           |       |                           |

     +---------------------------+       +---------------------------+

   The outer IP header Source Address and Destination Address identify
   the "endpoints" of the tunnel.  The inner IP header Source Address
   and Destination Addresses identify the original sender and recipient
   of the datagram, respectively.  The inner IP header is not changed by
   the encapsulator, except to decrement the TTL as noted below, and
   remains unchanged during its delivery to the tunnel exit point.  No
   change to IP options in the inner header occurs during delivery of
   the encapsulated datagram through the tunnel.  If need be, other
   protocol headers such as the IP Authentication header [[1](#ref-1)] may be
   inserted between the outer IP header and the inner IP header.  Note
   that the security options of the inner IP header MAY affect the
   choice of security options for the encapsulating (outer) IP header.

[3.1](#section-3.1). IP Header Fields and Handling

   The fields in the outer IP header are set by the encapsulator as
   follows:

      Version

         4

      IHL

         The Internet Header Length (IHL) is the length of the outer IP
         header measured in 32-bit words [[10](#ref-10)].

      TOS

         The Type of Service (TOS) is copied from the inner IP header.

      Total Length

         The Total Length measures the length of the entire encapsulated
         IP datagram, including the outer IP header, the inner IP
         header, and its payload.

      Identification, Flags, Fragment Offset

         These three fields are set as specified in [[10](#ref-10)].  However, if
         the "Don't Fragment" bit is set in the inner IP header, it MUST
         be set in the outer IP header; if the "Don't Fragment" bit is
         not set in the inner IP header, it MAY be set in the outer IP
         header, as described in [Section 5.1](#section-5.1).

      Time to Live

         The Time To Live (TTL) field in the outer IP header is set to a
         value appropriate for delivery of the encapsulated datagram to
         the tunnel exit point.

      Protocol

         4

      Header Checksum

         The Internet Header checksum [[10](#ref-10)] of the outer IP header.

Perkins                     Standards Track                     [Page 4]

[RFC 2003](/doc/html/rfc2003)                      IP-within-IP                  October 1996

      Source Address

         The IP address of the encapsulator, that is, the tunnel entry
         point.

      Destination Address

         The IP address of the decapsulator, that is, the tunnel exit
         point.

      Options

         Any options present in the inner IP header are in general NOT
         copied to the outer IP header.  However, new options specific
         to the tunnel path MAY be added.  In particular, any supported
         types of security options of the inner IP header MAY affect the
         choice of security options for the outer header.  It is not
         expected that there be a one-to-one mapping of such options to
         the options or security headers selected for the tunnel.

   When encapsulating a datagram, the TTL in the inner IP header is
   decremented by one if the tunneling is being done as part of
   forwarding the datagram; otherwise, the inner header TTL is not
   changed during encapsulation.  If the resulting TTL in the inner IP
   header is 0, the datagram is discarded and an ICMP Time Exceeded
   message SHOULD be returned to the sender.  An encapsulator MUST NOT
   encapsulate a datagram with TTL = 0.

   The TTL in the inner IP header is not changed when decapsulating.
   If, after decapsulation, the inner datagram has TTL = 0, the
   decapsulator MUST discard the datagram.  If, after decapsulation, the
   decapsulator forwards the datagram to one of its network interfaces,
   it will decrement the TTL as a result of doing normal IP forwarding.
   See also [Section 4.4](#section-4.4).

   The encapsulator may use any existing IP mechanisms appropriate for
   delivery of the encapsulated payload to the tunnel exit point.  In
   particular, use of IP options is allowed, and use of fragmentation is
   allowed unless the "Don't Fragment" bit is set in the inner IP
   header.  This restriction on fragmentation is required so that nodes
   employing Path MTU Discovery [[7](#ref-7)] can obtain the information they
   seek.

[3.2](#section-3.2). Routing Failures

   Routing loops within a tunnel are particularly dangerous when they
   cause datagrams to arrive again at the encapsulator.  Suppose a
   datagram arrives at a router for forwarding, and the router

Perkins                     Standards Track                     [Page 5]
```

```

[RFC 2003](/doc/html/rfc2003)                      IP-within-IP                  October 1996

   determines that the datagram has to be encapsulated before further
   delivery.  Then:

    -  If the IP Source Address of the datagram matches the router's own
       IP address on any of its network interfaces, the router MUST NOT
       tunnel the datagram; instead, the datagram SHOULD be discarded.

    -  If the IP Source Address of the datagram matches the IP address
       of the tunnel destination (the tunnel exit point is typically
       chosen by the router based on the Destination Address in the
       datagram's IP header), the router MUST NOT tunnel the datagram;
       instead, the datagram SHOULD be discarded.

   See also [Section 4.4](#section-4.4).

[4](#section-4). ICMP Messages from within the Tunnel

   After an encapsulated datagram has been sent, the encapsulator may
   receive an ICMP [[9](#ref-9)] message from any intermediate router within the
   tunnel other than the tunnel exit point.  The action taken by the
   encapsulator depends on the type of ICMP message received.  When the
   received message contains enough information, the encapsulator MAY
   use the incoming message to create a similar ICMP message, to be sent
   to the originator of the original unencapsulated IP datagram (the
   original sender).  This process will be referred to as "relaying" the
   ICMP message from the tunnel.

   ICMP messages indicating an error in processing a datagram include a
   copy of (a portion of) the datagram causing the error.  Relaying an
   ICMP message requires that the encapsulator strip off the outer IP
   header from this returned copy of the original datagram.  For cases
   in which the received ICMP message does not contain enough data to
   relay the message, see [Section 5](#section-5).

[4.1](#section-4.1). Destination Unreachable (Type 3)

   ICMP Destination Unreachable messages are handled by the encapsulator
   depending upon their Code field.  The model suggested here allows the
   tunnel to "extend" a network to include non-local (e.g., mobile)
   nodes.  Thus, if the original destination in the unencapsulated
   datagram is on the same network as the encapsulator, certain
   Destination Unreachable Code values may be modified to conform to the
   suggested model.

[RFC 2003](/doc/html/rfc2003)                      IP-within-IP                  October 1996

      Network Unreachable (Code 0)

         An ICMP Destination Unreachable message SHOULD be returned
         to the original sender.  If the original destination in
         the unencapsulated datagram is on the same network as the
         encapsulator, the newly generated Destination Unreachable
         message sent by the encapsulator MAY have Code 1 (Host
         Unreachable), since presumably the datagram arrived at the
         correct network and the encapsulator is trying to create the
         appearance that the original destination is local to that
         network even if it is not.  Otherwise, if the encapsulator
         returns a Destination Unreachable message, the Code field MUST
         be set to 0 (Network Unreachable).

      Host Unreachable (Code 1)

         The encapsulator SHOULD relay Host Unreachable messages to the
         sender of the original unencapsulated datagram, if possible.

      Protocol Unreachable (Code 2)

         When the encapsulator receives an ICMP Protocol Unreachable
         message, it SHOULD send a Destination Unreachable message with
         Code 0 or 1 (see the discussion for Code 0) to the sender of
         the original unencapsulated datagram.  Since the original
         sender did not use protocol 4 in sending the datagram, it would
         be meaningless to return Code 2 to that sender.

      Port Unreachable (Code 3)

         This Code should never be received by the encapsulator, since
         the outer IP header does not refer to any port number.  It MUST
         NOT be relayed to the sender of the original unencapsulated
         datagram.

      Datagram Too Big (Code 4)

         The encapsulator MUST relay ICMP Datagram Too Big messages to
         the sender of the original unencapsulated datagram.

      Source Route Failed (Code 5)

         This Code SHOULD be handled by the encapsulator itself.
         It MUST NOT be relayed to the sender of the original
         unencapsulated datagram.

[4.2](#section-4.2). Source Quench (Type 4)

   The encapsulator SHOULD NOT relay ICMP Source Quench messages to the
   sender of the original unencapsulated datagram, but instead SHOULD
   activate whatever congestion control mechanisms it implements to help
   alleviate the congestion detected within the tunnel.

[4.3](#section-4.3). Redirect (Type 5)

   The encapsulator MAY handle the ICMP Redirect messages itself.  It
   MUST NOT not relay the Redirect to the sender of the original
   unencapsulated datagram.

[4.4](#section-4.4). Time Exceeded (Type 11)

   ICMP Time Exceeded messages report (presumed) routing loops within
   the tunnel itself.  Reception of Time Exceeded messages by the
   encapsulator MUST be reported to the sender of the original
   unencapsulated datagram as Host Unreachable (Type 3, Code 1).  Host
   Unreachable is preferable to Network Unreachable; since the datagram
   was handled by the encapsulator, and the encapsulator is often
   considered to be on the same network as the destination address in
   the original unencapsulated datagram, then the datagram is considered
   to have reached the correct network, but not the correct destination
   node within that network.

[4.5](#section-4.5). Parameter Problem (Type 12)

   If the Parameter Problem message points to a field copied from the
   original unencapsulated datagram, the encapsulator MAY relay the ICMP
   message to the sender of the original unencapsulated datagram;
   otherwise, if the problem occurs with an IP option inserted by the
   encapsulator, then the encapsulator MUST NOT relay the ICMP message
   to the original sender.  Note that an encapsulator following
   prevalent current practice will never insert any IP options into the
   encapsulated datagram, except possibly for security reasons.

[4.6](#section-4.6). Other ICMP Messages

   Other ICMP messages are not related to the encapsulation operations
   described within this protocol specification, and should be acted on
   by the encapsulator as specified in [[9](#ref-9)].

[5](#section-5). Tunnel Management

   Unfortunately, ICMP only requires IP routers to return 8 octets (64
   bits) of the datagram beyond the IP header.  This is not enough to
   include a copy of the encapsulated (inner) IP header, so it is not
   always possible for the encapsulator to relay the ICMP message from
   the interior of a tunnel back to the original sender.  However, by
   carefully maintaining "soft state" about tunnels into which it sends,
   the encapsulator can return accurate ICMP messages to the original
   sender in most cases.  The encapsulator SHOULD maintain at least the
   following soft state information about each tunnel:

    - MTU of the tunnel ([Section 5.1](#section-5.1))
    - TTL (path length) of the tunnel
    - Reachability of the end of the tunnel

   The encapsulator uses the ICMP messages it receives from the interior
   of a tunnel to update the soft state information for that tunnel.
   ICMP errors that could be received from one of the routers along the
   tunnel interior include:

    - Datagram Too Big
    - Time Exceeded
    - Destination Unreachable
    - Source Quench

   When subsequent datagrams arrive that would transit the tunnel, the
   encapsulator checks the soft state for the tunnel.  If the datagram
   would violate the state of the tunnel (for example, the TTL of the
   new datagram is less than the tunnel "soft state" TTL) the
   encapsulator sends an ICMP error message back to the sender of the
   original datagram, but also encapsulates the datagram and forwards it
   into the tunnel.

   Using this technique, the ICMP error messages sent by the
   encapsulator will not always match up one-to-one with errors
   encountered within the tunnel, but they will accurately reflect the
   state of the network.

   Tunnel soft state was originally developed for the IP Address
   Encapsulation (IPAE) specification [[4](#ref-4)].

[5.1](#section-5.1). Tunnel MTU Discovery

   When the Don't Fragment bit is set by the originator and copied into
   the outer IP header, the proper MTU of the tunnel will be learned
   from ICMP Datagram Too Big (Type 3, Code 4) messages reported to the
   encapsulator.  To support sending nodes which use Path MTU Discovery,

Perkins                     Standards Track                     [Page 9]
```

```

[RFC 2003](/doc/html/rfc2003)                      IP-within-IP                  October 1996

   all encapsulator implementations MUST support Path MTU Discovery [5,
   7] soft state within their tunnels.  In this particular application,
   there are several advantages:

    -  As a benefit of Path MTU Discovery within the tunnel, any
       fragmentation which occurs because of the size of the
       encapsulation header is performed only once after encapsulation.
       This prevents multiple fragmentation of a single datagram, which
       improves processing efficiency of the decapsulator and the
       routers within the tunnel.

    -  If the source of the unencapsulated datagram is doing Path MTU
       Discovery, then it is desirable for the encapsulator to know
       the MTU of the tunnel.  Any ICMP Datagram Too Big messages from
       within the tunnel are returned to the encapsulator, and as noted
       in [Section 5](#section-5), it is not always possible for the encapsulator to
       relay ICMP messages to the source of the original unencapsulated
       datagram.  By maintaining "soft state" about the MTU of the
       tunnel, the encapsulator can return correct ICMP Datagram Too Big
       messages to the original sender of the unencapsulated datagram to
       support its own Path MTU Discovery.  In this case, the MTU that
       is conveyed to the original sender by the encapsulator SHOULD
       be the MTU of the tunnel minus the size of the encapsulating
       IP header.  This will avoid fragmentation of the original IP
       datagram by the encapsulator.

    -  If the source of the original unencapsulated datagram is
       not doing Path MTU Discovery, it is still desirable for the
       encapsulator to know the MTU of the tunnel.  In particular, it is
       much better to fragment the original datagram when encapsulating,
       than to allow the encapsulated datagram to be fragmented.
       Fragmenting the original datagram can be done by the encapsulator
       without special buffer requirements and without the need to
       keep reassembly state in the decapsulator.  By contrast, if
       the encapsulated datagram is fragmented, then the decapsulator
       must reassemble the fragmented (encapsulated) datagram before
       decapsulating it, requiring reassembly state and buffer space
       within the decapsulator.

   Thus, the encapsulator SHOULD normally do Path MTU Discovery,
   requiring it to send all datagrams into the tunnel with the "Don't
   Fragment" bit set in the outer IP header.  However there are problems
   with this approach.  When the original sender sets the "Don't
   Fragment" bit, the sender can react quickly to any returned ICMP
   Datagram Too Big error message by retransmitting the original
   datagram.  On the other hand, suppose that the encapsulator receives
   an ICMP Datagram Too Big message from within the tunnel.  In that
   case, if the original sender of the unencapsulated datagram had not

   set the "Don't Fragment" bit, there is nothing sensible that the
   encapsulator can do to let the original sender know of the error.
   The encapsulator MAY keep a copy of the sent datagram whenever it
   tries increasing the tunnel MTU, in order to allow it to fragment and
   resend the datagram if it gets a Datagram Too Big response.
   Alternatively the encapsulator MAY be configured for certain types of
   datagrams not to set the "Don't Fragment" bit when the original
   sender of the unencapsulated datagram has not set the "Don't
   Fragment" bit.

[5.2](#section-5.2). Congestion

   An encapsulator might receive indications of congestion from the
   tunnel, for example, by receiving ICMP Source Quench messages from
   nodes within the tunnel.  In addition, certain link layers and
   various protocols not related to the Internet suite of protocols
   might provide such indications in the form of a Congestion
   Experienced [[6](#ref-6)] flag.  The encapsulator SHOULD reflect conditions of
   congestion in its "soft state" for the tunnel, and when subsequently
   forwarding datagrams into the tunnel, the encapsulator SHOULD use
   appropriate means for controlling congestion [[3](#ref-3)]; However, the
   encapsulator SHOULD NOT send ICMP Source Quench messages to the
   original sender of the unencapsulated datagram.

[6](#section-6). Security Considerations

   IP encapsulation potentially reduces the security of the Internet,
   and care needs to be taken in the implementation and deployment of IP
   encapsulation.  For example, IP encapsulation makes it difficult for
   border routers to filter datagrams based on header fields.  In
   particular, the original values of the Source Address, Destination
   Address, and Protocol fields in the IP header, and the port numbers
   used in any transport header within the datagram, are not located in
   their normal positions within the datagram after encapsulation.
   Since any IP datagram can be encapsulated and passed through a
   tunnel, such filtering border routers need to carefully examine all
   datagrams.

[6.1](#section-6.1). Router Considerations

   Routers need to be aware of IP encapsulation protocols in order to
   correctly filter incoming datagrams.  It is desirable that such
   filtering be integrated with IP authentication [[1](#ref-1)].  Where IP
   authentication is used, encapsulated packets might be allowed to
   enter an organization when the encapsulating (outer) packet or the
   encapsulated (inner) packet is sent by an authenticated, trusted
   source.  Encapuslated packets containing no such authentication
   represent a potentially large security risk.

   IP datagrams which are encapsulated and encrypted [[2](#ref-2)] might also pose
   a problem for filtering routers.  In this case, the router can filter
   the datagram only if it shares the security association used for the
   encryption.  To allow this sort of encryption in environments in
   which all packets need to be filtered (or at least accounted for), a
   mechanism must be in place for the receiving node to securely
   communicate the security association to the border router.  This
   might, more rarely, also apply to the security association used for
   outgoing datagrams.

[6.2](#section-6.2). Host Considerations

   Host implementations that are capable of receiving encapsulated IP
   datagrams SHOULD admit only those datagrams fitting into one or more
   of the following categories:

    -  The protocol is harmless:  source address-based authentication is
       not needed.

    -  The encapsulating (outer) datagram comes from an authentically
       identified, trusted source.  The authenticity of the source could
       be established by relying on physical security in addition to
       border router configuration, but is more likely to come from use
       of the IP Authentication header [[1](#ref-1)].

    -  The encapuslated (inner) datagram includes an IP Authentication
       header.

    -  The encapsulated (inner) datagram is addressed to a network
       interface belonging to the decapsulator, or to a node with which
       the decapsulator has entered into a special relationship for
       delivering such encapsulated datagrams.

   Some or all of this checking could be done in border routers rather
   than the receiving node, but it is better if border router checks are
   used as backup, rather than being the only check.

## IP-in-IP protocol routes arbitrary traffic by default

#### Vulnerability Note VU#636397

Original Release Date: 2020-06-02 | Last Revised: 2020-09-30

---

### Overview

IP Encapsulation within IP (RFC2003 IP-in-IP) can be abused by an unauthenticated attacker to unexpectedly route arbitrary network traffic through a vulnerable device.

### Description

IP-in-IP encapsulation is a tunneling protocol specified in RFC 2003 that allows for IP packets to be encapsulated inside another IP packets. This is very similar to IPSEC VPNs in tunnel mode, except in the case of IP-in-IP, the traffic is unencrypted. As specified, the protocol unwraps the inner IP packet and forwards this packet through IP routing tables, potentially providing unexpected access to network paths available to the vulnerable device. An IP-in-IP device is considered to be vulnerable if it accepts IP-in-IP packets from any source to any destination without explicit configuration between the specified source and destination IP addresses. This unexpected Data Processing Error (CWE-19) by a vulnerable device can be abused to perform reflective DDoS and in certain scenarios used to bypass network access control lists. Because the forwarded network packet may not be inspected or verified by vulnerable devices, there are possibly other unexpected behaviors that can be abused by an attacker on the target device or the target device's network environment.

### Impact

An unauthenticated attacker can route network traffic through a vulnerable device, which may lead to reflective DDoS, information leak and bypass of network access controls.

### Solution

#### Apply updates

The CERT/CC recommends that you apply the latest patch provided by the affected vendor that addresses this issue. Review the vendor information below or contact your vendor or supplier for specific mitigation advice. If a device has the ability to disable IP-in-IP in its configuration, it is recommended that you disable IP-in-IP in all interfaces that do not require this feature. Device manufacturers are urged to disable IP-in-IP in their default configuration and to require their customers to explicitly configure IP-in-IP as and when needed.

#### Disable IP-in-IP

Users can block IP-in-IP packets by filtering IP protocol number 4. Note this filtering is for the IPv4 Protocol (or IPv6 Next Header) field value of 4 and *not* IP protocol version 4 (IPv4).

#### Proof of Concept (PoC)

A proof-of-concept originally written by Yannay Livneh is [available](https://github.com/CERTCC/PoC-Exploits/tree/master/cve-2020-10136) in the CERT/CC PoC respository.

#### Detection Signature (IDS)

This Snort IDS rule looks for any IP-in-IP traffic, whether intentional or not seen at upstream network path of a vulnerable device. This Snort or Suricata rule can be modified to apply filters that ignore sources and destinations that are allowed by policy to route IP-in-IP traffic.

`alert ip any any -> any any (msg: "IP-in-IP Tunneling VU#636397 https://kb.cert.org"; ip_proto:4; sid: 1367636397; rev:1;)`

"text": "A vulnerability in the network stack of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass certain security boundaries or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the affected device unexpectedly decapsulating and processing IP in IP packets that are destined to a locally configured IP address. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IP in IP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause the affected device to unexpectedly decapsulate the IP in IP packet and forward the inner IP packet. This may result in IP packets bypassing input access control lists (ACLs) configured on the affected device or other security boundaries defined elsewhere in the network.\r\n\r\nUnder certain conditions, an exploit could cause the network stack process to crash and restart multiple times, leading to a reload of the affected device and a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-ipip-dos-kCT9X4 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-ipip-dos-kCT9X4\"]"

"title": "Details",
"text": "RFC 2003 specifies a method to encapsulate an IPv4 datagram within another IPv4 datagram. The IP protocol number 4 is used to indicate that the payload within a carrier IP packet is a passenger IPv4 packet.\r\n\r\nMultiple Cisco products running Cisco NX-OS Software support IP in IP packet encapsulation and decapsulation when a tunnel interface is manually configured on the device using tunnel mode ipip and appropriate tunnel source and tunnel destination. The device is not expected to decapsulate and process any IP in IP traffic that is not destined to such a tunnel interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability causes an affected device to unexpectedly decapsulate and process IP in IP packets that are destined to a locally configured IP address, even when no tunnel configuration is present. Any input ACL configured on an inbound interface of the affected device is evaluated against the IP fields on the carrier IP packet prior to decapsulation; it would not be evaluated on the passenger IP packet. This may result in the passenger IP packet bypassing the intended ACL filtering. This may also allow the passenger IP packet to bypass other security boundaries that might be defined in the network path to the affected device in the presence of network filtering techniques that only inspect the outer IP header and not the inner IP packet.\r\n\r\nUnder specific conditions, processing of a crafted IP in IP packet could cause the network stack process to crash on an affected device. Repeated exploitation that causes the network stack process to restart multiple times could lead to a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition. A crash of the network stack process is followed by creation of a netstack core file on the device, which can be viewed by using the show cores CLI command (or dir cores on the local-mgmt CLI for Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects). If a netstack core file is present, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to review the file and determine whether this vulnerability has been exploited on the device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can only be triggered by IP in IP traffic that is destined to an affected device and cannot be exploited using traffic that transits an affected device. The vulnerability can only be triggered by IP in IP packets on which both the carrier and the passenger datagrams are IPv4. It cannot be triggered when either carrier, passenger, or both carrier and passenger are IPv6 datagrams, nor can it be triggered by any other tunneling protocol, including but not limited to Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)."

{
"category": "general",
"title": "Workarounds",
"text": "Using infrastructure access control lists (iACLs) to allow only strictly required management and control plane traffic that is destined to the affected device, as recommended in the Cisco Guide to Securing NX-OS Software Devices [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/securing\_nx\_os.html\"], would prevent exploitation of this issue on Nexus devices. Customers may also consider explicitly denying all IP packets with protocol number 4 (corresponding to IP in IP packets) as part of their iACLs, if no legitimate IP in IP traffic is used in their network. A customized control plane policing (CoPP) policy may also be used to drop IP in IP traffic that is destined to an affected device; however, support for CoPP customization varies across different Nexus platforms and software releases. Customers are advised to contact their support organization for any assistance required with evaluating the feasibility of a workaround and with implementing a workaround on an affected device.\r\n\r\nExploitation of this issue on Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects is only possible if NetFlow monitoring is enabled on an affected device. Customers who do not have a strict requirement of using NetFlow monitoring may evaluate the possibility of disabling it until they can perform a software upgrade to a fixed release.\r\n\r\nCustomers should first evaluate the impact of configuration changes to the device and their security policy. Customers concerned about undesired or unexpected side effects should consult with their support organization before implementing any configuration change."

By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nCisco NX-OS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½First Fixedï¿½ï¿½ï¿½). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Combined First Fixedï¿½ï¿½ï¿½).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software, platform, and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.\r\n\r\nCustomers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a releaseï¿½ï¿½ï¿½for example, 7.0(3)I7(5) for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or 14.0(1h) for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:\r\n Cisco NX-OS Software Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches Nexus 1000V Series Switches Nexus 3000 Series Switches Nexus 5000 Series Switches Nexus 6000 Series Switches Nexus 7000 Series Switches Nexus 9000 Series Switches\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search.\r\n\r\n Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches SMUs\r\nFor Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches, software maintenance upgrades (SMUs) are available for Cisco NX-OS Software Release 7.3(6)D1(1). Customers can download the following SMUs from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html\"] on Cisco.com:\r\n\r\nn7700-s2-dk9.7.3.6.D1.1.CSCvt66624.bin\r\nn7000-s2-dk9.7.3.6.D1.1.CSCvt66624.bin\r\n\r\nFor details about downloading and installing SMUs in Cisco NX-OS Software for Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches, see the Performing Software Maintenance Upgrades [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus7000/sw/system-management/guide/b\_Cisco\_Nexus\_7000\_Series\_NX-OS\_System\_Management\_Configuration\_Guide-RI/b\_Cisco\_Nexus\_7000\_Series\_NX-OS\_System\_Management\_Configuration\_Guide-RI\_chapter\_011011.html\"] section of the Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS System Management Configuration Guide.\r\n Cisco UCS Software\r\nIn the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and which release included the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nUCS 6200 and 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects:\r\n Cisco UCS Software Release First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability Earlier than 3.2 3.2(3o) 3.2 3.2(3o) 4.0 4.0(4i) (June 2020) 4.1 4.1(1d) (June 2020)\r\nAdditional Resources\r\nFor help determining the best Cisco NX-OS Software release for a Cisco Nexus Switch, administrators can refer to the following Recommended Releases documents. If a security advisory recommends a later release, Cisco recommends following the advisory guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco MDS Series Switches [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/mds9000/sw/b\_MDS\_NX-OS\_Recommended\_Releases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 1000V for VMware Switch [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus1000/sw/recommended\_releases/b\_Cisco\_N1KV\_VMware\_MinRecommendedReleases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/recommended\_release/b\_Minimum\_and\_Recommended\_Cisco\_NX-OS\_Releases\_for\_Cisco\_Nexus\_3000\_Series\_Switches.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 5500 Platform Switches [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5500/sw/release/recommended\_releases/n5500\_recommended\_nx-os\_releases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 5600 Platform Switches [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5600/sw/release/recommended\_releases/n5600\_recommended\_nx-os\_releases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 6000 Series Switches [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus6000/sw/release/recommended\_releases/recommended\_nx-os\_releases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/nx-os/recommended\_releases/recommended\_nx-os\_releases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/recommended\_release/b\_Minimum\_and\_Recommended\_Cisco\_NX-OS\_Releases\_for\_Cisco\_Nexus\_9000\_Series\_Switches.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI-Mode Switches [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/recommended-release/b\_Recommended\_Cisco\_ACI\_Releases.html\"]\r\n To determine the best release for Cisco UCS, see the Recommended Releases documents in the release notes for the device."

The vulnerability is due to the affected device unexpectedly decapsulating and processing IP in IP packets that are destined to a locally configured IP address. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IP in IP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause the affected device to unexpectedly decapsulate the IP in IP packet and forward the inner IP packet. This may result in IP packets bypassing input access control lists (ACLs) configured on the affected device or other security boundaries defined elsewhere in the network.  Under certain conditions, an exploit could cause the network stack process to crash and restart multiple times, leading to a reload of the affected device and a DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-ipip-dos-kCT9X4>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software:    + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere ([CSCvu10050](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu10050))   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V ([CSCvt67738](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt67738))   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere ([CSCvt67738](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt67738))   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches ([CSCun53663](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun53663))1   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches ([CSCvt67739](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt67739))   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches ([CSCvt67739](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt67739))   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches ([CSCvt67739](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt67739))   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches ([CSCvt66624](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt66624))   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode ([CSCun53663](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun53663))1   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects ([CSCvu03158](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu03158))   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects ([CSCvt67740](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt67740)) 1Only a limited set of releases for Nexus 3000 Series and Nexus 9000 Series Switches is affected by this vulnerability. Details are available in the Cisco Software Checker as described in the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  It is not required to have an IP in IP tunnel interface configured on the device in order to be affected by this vulnerability. Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects are affected only when NetFlow monitoring is enabled on the device and a flow exporter profile is configured with a source IP address set for the exporter interface. For details about NetFlow configuration for Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects, see the [NetFlow Monitoring](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/ucs-manager/GUI-User-Guides/System-Monitoring/3-2/b_UCSM_GUI_System_Monitoring_Guide_3_2/b_UCSM_GUI_System_Monitoring_Guide_3_2_chapter_01110.html) section of the *Cisco UCS Manager System Monitoring Guide*.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following products:    + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects  Details  * RFC 2003 specifies a method to encapsulate an IPv4 datagram within another IPv4 datagram. The IP protocol number 4 is used to indicate that the payload within a *carrier* IP packet is a *passenger* IPv4 packet.  Multiple Cisco products running Cisco NX-OS Software support IP in IP packet encapsulation and decapsulation when a tunnel interface is manually configured on the device using *tunnel mode ipip* and appropriate *tunnel source* and *tunnel destination*. The device is not expected to decapsulate and process any IP in IP traffic that is not destined to such a tunnel interface.  This vulnerability causes an affected device to unexpectedly decapsulate and process IP in IP packets that are destined to a locally configured IP address, even when no tunnel configuration is present. Any input ACL configured on an inbound interface of the affected device is evaluated against the IP fields on the carrier IP packet prior to decapsulation; it would not be evaluated on the passenger IP packet. This may result in the passenger IP packet bypassing the intended ACL filtering. This may also allow the passenger IP packet to bypass other security boundaries that might be defined in the network path to the affected device in the presence of network filtering techniques that only inspect the outer IP header and not the inner IP packet.  Under specific conditions, processing of a crafted IP in IP packet could cause the network stack process to crash on an affected device. Repeated exploitation that causes the network stack process to restart multiple times could lead to a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition. A crash of the network stack process is followed by creation of a *netstack* core file on the device, which can be viewed by using the **show cores** CLI command (or **dir cores** on the *local-mgmt* CLI for Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects). If a *netstack* core file is present, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to review the file and determine whether this vulnerability has been exploited on the device.  This vulnerability can only be triggered by IP in IP traffic that is destined to an affected device and cannot be exploited using traffic that transits an affected device. The vulnerability can only be triggered by IP in IP packets on which both the carrier and the passenger datagrams are IPv4. It cannot be triggered when either carrier, passenger, or both carrier and passenger are IPv6 datagrams, nor can it be triggered by any other tunneling protocol, including but not limited to Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE).  Workarounds  * Using infrastructure access control lists (iACLs) to allow only strictly required management and control plane traffic that is destined to the affected device, as recommended in the [Cisco Guide to Securing NX-OS Software Devices](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/securing_nx_os.html), would prevent exploitation of this issue on Nexus devices. Customers may also consider explicitly denying all IP packets with protocol number 4 (corresponding to IP in IP packets) as part of their iACLs, if no legitimate IP in IP traffic is used in their network. A customized control plane policing (CoPP) policy may also be used to drop IP in IP traffic that is destined to an affected device; however, support for CoPP customization varies across different Nexus platforms and software releases. Customers are advised to contact their support organization for any assistance required with evaluating the feasibility of a workaround and with implementing a workaround on an affected device.  Exploitation of this issue on Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects is only possible if NetFlow monitoring is enabled on an affected device. Customers who do not have a strict requirement of using NetFlow monitoring may evaluate the possibility of disabling it until they can perform a software upgrade to a fixed release.  Customers should first evaluate the impact of configuration changes to the device and their security policy. Customers concerned about undesired or unexpected side effects should consult with their support organization before implementing any configuration change.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  Cisco NX-OS Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (âFirst Fixedâ). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (âCombined First Fixedâ).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software, platform, and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.  Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a release-for example, **7.0(3)I7(5)** for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or **14.0(1h)** for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:    Cisco NX-OS Software   Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode      MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   Nexus 1000V Series Switches   Nexus 3000 Series Switches   Nexus 5000 Series Switches   Nexus 6000 Series Switches   Nexus 7000 Series Switches   Nexus 9000 Series Switches        By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR).
