- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions on the directory containing service executables.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient access control on the service executable directory which allows a local attacker to place arbitrary commands there. When the system restarts, these commands would be executed with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, leading to a complete compromise of the system. The specific impact is listed as High for Confidentiality and Integrity, and None for Availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required. The attack vector is a local attack (AV:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low-privileged local access to the system. The attack does not require user interaction (UI:N).
