Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2020-10827:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `apmd` service of DrayTek routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `apmd` service, which is a web server, has a vulnerability in how it handles the `Authorization` header during Digest authentication.
- Specifically, the function `sub_11FB8` (in `cvmd` on Vigor 3900 1.4.4, likely similar in `apmd`) is vulnerable.
- The function extracts values from the `Authorization` header into a temporary stack buffer.
- The vulnerability occurs during the copying of the extracted values into the temp stack buffer, where a size check is not properly performed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an unauthorized attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely on the affected device.
- By overflowing the stack buffer, the attacker can overwrite return addresses and registers, leading to code execution with the privileges of the `apmd` process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/ACSServer/services/ACSServlet` endpoint.
- The malicious data is injected through the `Authorization` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs network access to the device in order to send the crafted HTTP request.
- The attacker needs to know the structure of the `Authorization` header and the location of the vulnerable function to craft a working exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable function `sub_11FB8` copies the value from the `Authorization` header to a stack buffer of size 0x64 bytes. Two different code paths are vulnerable while copying the value to the stack buffer using `memcpy`.
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to overwrite the return address (`PC`) to gain control of execution and run a command using the vulnerable `system` function.
- The exploit targets Vigor3900 version 1.4.4.
- The vulnerability also affects `cvmd` service (CVE-2020-10828), which has a very similar vulnerability using the same code-base.
