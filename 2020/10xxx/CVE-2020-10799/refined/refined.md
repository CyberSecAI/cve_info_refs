Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of disabling external entity expansion (XXE) in the `svglib` library when parsing SVG files. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML code that can cause the parser to retrieve arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The primary weakness is the library's vulnerability to XXE attacks, where the XML parser processes external entities defined in the SVG file without proper sanitization or disabling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of the XXE vulnerability allows an attacker to read sensitive files from the server's file system. In the provided example, the attacker attempts to read `/etc/passwd`.
- **Potential Server Compromise:** Depending on the server's file system and user permissions, this could potentially lead to a broader compromise or further attacks by exposing sensitive configuration files, application code, or user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SVG file:** The attacker crafts a specially formed SVG file that includes a malicious XML entity definition that references an external resource (local file on the server).
- **Processing of SVG file by `svglib`:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `svg2rlg` function from `svglib` processes the attacker-controlled SVG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to supply SVG file:** The attacker must be able to provide the malicious SVG file to be processed by the vulnerable `svglib` library. This could be through file uploads or any means where the application processes an SVG file provided by the attacker.
- **Application using `svglib`:** The application using the `svglib` library needs to use `svg2rlg` to process the malicious SVG file.

**Additional Information:**
- The content provides a specific code example that demonstrates the vulnerability. The code snippet shows how to exploit the XXE vulnerability by embedding a malicious entity in the SVG payload and then processing it with `svg2rlg`. The provided example shows how to extract /etc/passwd.
- The issue was reported on Feb 25, 2020, indicating a relatively old vulnerability.
- The content goes beyond the basic CVE description by providing a full technical description and a working exploit example.
