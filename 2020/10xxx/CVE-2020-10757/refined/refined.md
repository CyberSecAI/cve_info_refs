Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the CVE-2020-10757 vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided content directly references CVE-2020-10757 and details a Linux kernel vulnerability. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**:
    The vulnerability stems from how the Linux kernel's `mremap` system call handles DAX (Direct Access) huge pages when remapping them to an anonymous memory region. Specifically, the kernel incorrectly assumed that a huge page mapped with DAX was also a Transparent Huge Page (THP). This caused an issue during remapping, allowing user PTE access.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    - Incorrect handling of DAX huge pages during `mremap`.
    - Lack of proper validation when remapping DAX huge pages to anonymous memory, leading to incorrect assumptions about the nature of the page table entries.
    - Potential exposure of user-level PTE access (as indicated by the Suse information)
    - The Netapp document stated: "Linux kernel versions 4.5-rc1 through 5.7.4 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS)."

*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    - Disclosure of sensitive information.
    - Potential for data modification.
    - Denial of service (DoS) conditions.
    - In particular, the Suse document points to potential for complete compromise in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability due to the ability to escalate privileges on the system.

*   **Attack Vectors**:
    - The attack vector is **local** access, as per the Netapp and Suse documents.
    - The Suse document also notes that the attack complexity is low
    - The Netapp document states the vulnerability is in Linux kernel versions 4.5-rc1 through 5.7.4.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    - The attacker needs **local** access to the system.
    - According to the SUSE document, the attacker requires low level privileges to perform the attack, the NetApp advisory mentions that the affected version allows "privilege escalation", the Suse document specifies a non-privilege escalation vector, or one that is equivalent to root, i.e. "None".
    - The Netapp advisory also notes that attacker needs access to "DAX enabled storage".
    - No user interaction is required.

**3. Additional details from the content**

*   **NetApp's Affected Products:** The NetApp advisory lists several affected products, including:
    - Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere
    - FAS/AFF Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - 8300/8700/A400/C400
    - NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault)
    - NetApp SolidFire Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)
    - NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage

*  **SUSE information**:
     - SUSE lists a similar description of the vulnerability.
     - SUSE indicates that it considers this to be an important issue with a severity level of **important**.
     - SUSE CVSS v3 score is 8.4.  This is different from the NVD score, which is 7.8. The access vector remains local, attack complexity remains low, no user interaction required, same scope (unchanged), and same confidentiality, integrity and availability impact, but the privileges required are listed as none for SUSE and low for NVD.
     - SUSE notes that the kernel-default package will no longer be fixed for all CVEs, and they will declare some as "won't fix", see [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for details.
     - SUSE provides a detailed listing of the numerous Linux distros and sub-components that are affected.
     -SUSE provides a detailed listing of the released packages and their fixes.

*   **SUSE Advisories:** The SUSE content lists various SUSE security advisories related to this CVE.

*   **OpenSUSE:** The OpenSUSE mailing list archive provides further confirmation of the issue and fixes.
    - States the rating for this fix as "important"
    - Includes links to the SUSE bugzilla entries that describe the fix

*   **Debian:** The Debian security advisory also lists this vulnerability as one of many that has been fixed.

*  **Ubuntu**: The Ubuntu security advisory includes the CVE ID and states "A local attacker with access to DAX storage could use this to gain administrative privileges."

* **Linux Kernel Mailing List (lkml.org) information**:
    - The LKML message contains the commit details and patch that addresses this vulnerability including the description of the cause as being related to how the kernel handles mapping a "huge pmd devmap"
    - The patch changes the condition for handling huge pmds to consider pmd_devmap as well as is_swap_pmd or pmd_trans_huge
    - The LKML contains information about the test and fixes applied in the patch.

**4. Additional Observations**

The Suse and Netapp advisories provide differing vectors. The SUSE document explicitly states that privilege escalation is a vector for attack, whereas the Netapp advisory simply notes it could lead to  "disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS)". Also, the privileges required are stated as "low" in the Suse advisory but are noted as "low" for the required privileges in the NVD entry, with the Netapp advisory only stating an attacker needs "local" access.

**5. Summary**

This is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Linux kernel related to how it handles DAX huge pages when remapping to anonymous pages. A local attacker with low level privileges can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service or gain complete privileges of the system, as well as potentially disclose sensitive information, or modify data. The vulnerability affects a wide variety of NetApp and Suse products, as well as various Linux distros and versions of the kernel from 4.5-rc1 up to 5.7.4.
