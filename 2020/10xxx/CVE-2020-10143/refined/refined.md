Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10143:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `OPENSSLDIR` variable within the Macrium Reflect software. This variable is set to `C:\openssl\`, a location where standard (non-admin) users can create directories and files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure `OPENSSLDIR` Configuration:** The software uses a default `OPENSSLDIR` that is writable by unprivileged users, allowing them to place malicious configuration files.
*   **Privileged Service:** Macrium Reflect contains a privileged service that utilizes the OpenSSL component. This service inherits the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can place a specially crafted `openssl.cnf` file in the `C:\openssl\` directory.
*   **SYSTEM Privilege Escalation:** When the privileged Macrium Reflect service uses the OpenSSL component, the attacker's malicious configuration file is parsed, allowing arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM level privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Manipulation:** The attack involves creating directories and a malicious configuration file (`openssl.cnf`) in a location writable by unprivileged users.
*   **Configuration File Injection:** The malicious configuration file is loaded by the vulnerable service, leading to code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unprivileged User Access:** An attacker only needs to have standard (non-administrator) user access to the Windows system.
*   **File System Write Access:**  The attacker needs the ability to create directories and files in the `C:\openssl\` path.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in the Macrium Reflect 7.2 series of releases.
*   Macrium Reflect versions 6, 7.0 and 7.1 are not affected.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Macrium Reflect v7.3.5281 and later.
