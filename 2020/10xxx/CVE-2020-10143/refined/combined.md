| **Initial Macrium Reflect v7.3 Public Release v7.3.5281 - 14th October 2020**  **We recommend all users upgrade to this release.**   * **Initial v7.3 Release**   [Please see this KB article for more information on what's included.](https://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW72/New%2Bin%2BMacrium%2BReflect%2B7.3) * **Changed Block Tracker**   After performing a restore of a non-system volume for which CBT had been enabled, CBT could become disabled on that volume and would not re-enable until the system had been restarted. This has been resolved. * **Email Notifications**   We've enhanced OpenSSL integration and upgraded to 1.1.1h to address any potential security concerns. |

| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.5107 - 5th August 2020**   * **Reflect hanging after running a backup**   Release 7.2.5098 could cause ReflectBin.exe to hang at the end of a backup. This has been resolved. |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.5098 - 5th August 2020**   * **Restore/Clone**   + We've added a new confirmation prompt when extending a partition beyond 2TB on an MBR disk. Extending beyond 2TB will cause the disk layout to be converted to GPT format and will cause MBR system disks to be non-bootable. In the rescue media, we've also added a warning to indicate that disks converted to GPT will not be accessible by Windows XP and Server 2003.   + When copying an MBR 'Active' partition to an existing non 'Active' partition the target partition may not get marked 'Active' after restoring. This has been resolved. * **Automatic system restore for 32 bit systems**   If initiating a system restore in Windows causes the boot menu to be automatically added then, for 32 bit systems, local NIC and mass storage drivers may not be copied. This has been resolved. * **Changed Block Tracker**   + Fixed a permission issue that prevented the Encrypted File System (EFS) from encrypting some files on volumes that were formatted while CBT was active.   + Improved compatibility with Windows 10 build 2004.  - **Various**   Various minor fixes and changes to improve Macrium Reflect. |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4971 - 16th June 2020**   * **Legacy MBR Systems**   + For MBR Windows 10 systems the 'Create an image of the partition(s) required to backup and restore Windows' now includes the Windows Recovery partition.   + MBR systems using BitLocker for the Windows volume would require running 'Fix Windows boot problems' after a 'live' BitLocker restore. This has been resolved. * **UEFI System detection**   The Windows 10 2004 (May) update caused legacy MBR systems to be detected as UEFI. This has been resolved. * **File and Folder Backup**   File and Folder 'Folders to exclude' now permits trailing backslashes. * **Macrium viBoot**   viBoot Virtual Machine names are now limited to 100 characters. This prevents viBoot VMs from exceeding the Hyper-V name length limit. * **Rescue Media Builder**   + RMBuilder now prevents the boot menu being set for PE 3.1 on UEFI booting systems. PE 3.1 is legacy MBR only.   + RMBuilder would incorrectly report that not enough free space was available when using 1GB flash media. This has been resolved. |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4952 - 29th May 2020**   * **Macrium Image Guardian**   Some customers have reported erroneous MIG block notifications and a Macrium Service process crash. This has been resolved |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4942 - 22nd May 2020**   * **Backup Progress**   We've added a live backup total progress bar to the Reflect task bar icon. * **Backup blocked**   A few customers have noticed backups hanging after completion which could prevent the next backup from starting. We've improved the communication between backup instances to prevent a potential race condition. * **ReDeploy**   Some customers have noticed poor CPU performance after redeploying to new hardware. ReDeploy has been improved to only reset CPU drivers if a CPU change is detected |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4884 - 9th May 2020**   * **Email Notifications**   Some customers have reported that Reflect notification emails have been rejected by their email service providers. This has been resolved. |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4861 - 23rd April 2020**   * **XP Only**   This is an XP only release that resolves the error "missing bcrypt.dll" when starting Reflect. |
|| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4859 - 23rd April 2020**   * **File and Folder Backup**   We've excluded MS Volume Shadow Copy from participating in backups of removable drives. Previously, a File and Folder backup would report VSS errors before continuing if folders on a removable drive, such as a Flash drive, were included. VSS is not supported on removable media. * **MS Exchange**   Some customers have reported an application crash when running MS Exchange incremental backups. This has been resolved. * **GPT Disk Layouts**   We've added an additional check to allow the GPT partition table to contain gaps when loading disk layouts in Reflect. It's possible that GPT partition tables can be non-contiguous if the disk has been formatted or updated using Linux. * **Rescue Media**   + To distinguish between multiple Ethernet Adapters with a similar name, the Windows PE Network Adapter dialog now shows the MAC address of each adapter.   + Changing the rescue media staging area volume would not always remove all the files on the old volume. This has been resolved.   + If a new edition of Reflect is installed, e.g, Workstation to Server, the Rescue Media Builder will now prompt for a rebuild of the rescue media. |
| --- |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4808 - 25th March 2020**   * **German Language Version Only**   A program exception could occur when opening the verification dialog. This has been resolved. * **Macrium Changed Block Tracker (MRCBT)**   CBT could erroneously hang on to volume locks on some systems causing problems with scheduling system volume chkdsk events, USB drive ejection and OneDrive Personal Vault. This has been resolved. |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4797 - 19th March 2020**    In response to potential file system corruption issues that could arise from applying some recent Windows Updates, we have reviewed our data integrity checks and implemented new features: See <https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/kb4535996/134c504e-bb55-4e3c-a5da-28794a4b6079>  **Note:** The first Incremental after installing may take much longer than normal. * **Changed Block Tracker**   We've improved CBT to reset more robustly on System power failure, unexpected shutdown and unexpected device removal. * **Repair option when verifying Image files**   We've added an 'Attempt repair' option when verifying image files. If block corruption is detected and the live file system contains the original data then the block is repaired by replacing with the original data. Block corruption is exceptionally rare but this additional feature is designed to further mitigate file system and storage problems. We've also added an additional command line switch to the standalone verification utility. See [https://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW72/Verifying+image+and+backup+files](https://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW72/Verifying%2Bimage%2Band%2Bbackup%2Bfiles)   and [https://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW72/Verifying+image+and+backup+files+from+the+command+line](https://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW72/Verifying%2Bimage%2Band%2Bbackup%2Bfiles%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2Bcommand%2Bline)  **Note:** Repair isn't guaranteed and will only be attempted if the originating source volume exists on the system performing the verification. * **Consolidation**   We've also added verification and live repair attempt on verification failure for merged blocks during consolidation. If a data block fails verification when read for merging, the live file system is checked for the original block data. * **Incremental Deltas**   It was possible for a damaged Incremental index to go undetected when constructing a full index chain. This was a rare occurrence, but it could propagate further into the backup set. We have enhanced our detection code to prevent this from occurring in future. * **Clone and restore**   Display power saving settings are now honored during Clone and Restore operations. Previously the display would remain on regardless of the Windows settings. * **Exchange**   Exchange delta incs could fail to build if multiple volumes were present for Exchange DB and meta data/log files. This has been resolved. |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4744 - 18th February 2020**   * **Alternative Locations**   The 'Alternative Locations' functionality could fail to work as expected and attempt to append to backup sets from the alternative location even if the primary location was available. This has been resolved. **Note:** When a backup runs, If the location contains an orphaned delta Incremental then the text **'.error\_loading'** will be appended to the orphaned file name and the backup will continue. This will be indicated in the backup log as a warning. |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4732 - 15th February 2020**   * **Error: 'Error reading Image file'**   Some customers have received 'Error reading Image file' when creating Delta Incremental Images. This has been resolved.   **We recommend re-building your rescue media if currently built with v7.2.4711 to ensure compatibility with your backup sets.** * **Volume detection**   Reflect would fail to recognise file systems formatted on Dynamic volumes spanning disks with 4K sector sizes. This has been resolved. * **Rescue Media Builder**   + This release resolves a problem starting the rescue environment from the recovery boot created menu with v7.2.4711.     **Note:** Running either this full installer or patch will automatically correct the current boot menu. If you continue to have problems then please launch RMBuilder and remove/re-add the boot menu.   + Moving the PE staging files to a different drive would result in duplication of the boot\Macrium sub folder. This has been resolved.     **Note:** If a corrupt PE staging folder structure is detected by RMBuilder then it will be automatically deleted. |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4711 - 12th February 2020**   * **Delta Index Saving Efficiency**   We've improved the efficiency of saving Incrementals with large delta indexes. * **Technicians USB**   We've enabled the Technicians USB stick and ISO to run the portable version of Reflect on Windows Hyper-V and Server Core OS's. * **Phantom partitions on GPT Disks**   A corrupt GPT partition table on disk could cause Reflect to display 'phantom' disk partitions. This has been resolved. * **Standalone Consolidation**   Using the Standalone Consolidation tool, consolidate.exe, to consolidate Incrementals where an existing consolidated Inc is between the 'From' and 'To' Inc, could cause Reflect to erroneously try to locate a previously consolidated file when the backup set was opened. This has been resolved. * **File and Folder**   If a File and Folder backup definition included multiple root paths for the same drive but the drive letter was specified in both upper and lower case (eg, 'D:\Data\1' & 'd:\Data\2') then the backed up paths could be erroneously split at 'D:' & 'd:' when mounting the backup in Windows Explorer. This has been resolved * **Alternative locations**   Using 'Alternative locations' for a backup could break the 'Enforce an entered image or File and Folder backup file name' option in the global defaults. This has been resolved * **Rescue Media Builder**   + When building PE 10 rescue media, RMBuilder will now correctly detect any installed PE 10 ADK of version 1803 or later.   + If RMBuilder found any file system errors while scanning a folder for drivers, the rescue media builder could close unexpectedly. This has been resolved.   + When building PE 10 rescue media, RMBuilder would sometimes unnecessarily perform a full rebuild of the wim. This has been resolved.   + Under certain circumstances, RMBuilder would not be able to swap between Windows PE and Windows RE. This has been resolved.   + Checking and un-checking the Override Drivers checkbox will no longer cause drivers to change status from "Driver already present" to "Copy host drivers". |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4601 - 24th December 2019**   * **Image Mounting**   Un-mounting an image failed if Windows Explorer was showing the mounted drive letter. This has been resolved. |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4594 - 23rd December 2019**   * **Image Mounting**   A small number of customers reported that they could not mount Macrium Reflect images after dismounting a previously mounted image. This has been resolved. * **viBoot**   We've improved the ability for Reflect to detect bootable image files and enable the 'Boot Image' functionality in Reflect. * **Bitlocker system restore**   Automatic system restores for BitLocker encrypted system volumes could perform a 'BitLocker Removal' restore instead of the expected 'BitLocker Live' restore. This has been resolved. * **VBScript & PowerShell**   The 'Run Once a Day' option when generating PowerShell and VBScript source files didn't behave as expected for scheduled tasks using the SYSTEM account. This has been resolved. * **Verify File System**   The 'Verify File System' default image option was not honored if unchecked for scheduled images running using the SYSTEM account. This has been resolved. * **Rescue Media Builder**   + The default location for PE files has been moved back to $PROGRAMDATA$\Macrium\Reflect'.   + On Windows 7, when building Windows PE rescue media, RMBuilder will now use the Dism.exe corresponding to the wim, rather than the Dism.exe from the WAIK.   + On Windows XP, the radio button labels for boot menu options would sometimes be truncated. This has been resolved.   + If the "override WinPE compatible drivers" checkbox was unchecked, custom USB drivers would sometimes not be included into the rescue media. This has been resolved.   + If there was more than one version of the Windows ADK installed, RMBuilder would not copy required files from either installed ADK, and would instead prompt for a download. This has been resolved |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4557 - 29th November 2019**   * **Macrium Image Guardian**   While attempting to retrieve the status of a process that was closing, the MIG driver could inadvertently access an invalid address resulting in a BSoD. This has been resolved. * **Rescue Media Builder**   + On Windows XP, the rescue media builder would sometimes give a "WIM file not found" pop-up when there was a valid WIM file present. This has been resolved.   + When performing an automatic restore on a system with multiple network adapters, the network adapter configuration process will be logged in more detail. |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4539 - 18th November 2019**   * **Server Plus Edition**   Exchange backups could crash after completion if the log file couldn't be written to. This has been resolved * **Incorrect ReflectUI.exe Message Box**    On system startup an incorrect pop-up dialog box could be shown by ReflectUI.exe. This has been resolved * **viBoot**   Images created by 'foreign' systems (not the same PC) could fail to enable the 'Boot Image' functionality in Reflect. This has been resolved * **Macrium Image Guardian**   We've improved the security of MIG by enhancing the malicious injection of threads into running processes. * **Change Block Tracker**   Minor performance and stability enhancements. * **Rescue Media Builder**   + On some systems with dynamic disks, it was possible for the location of the PE files to be incorrectly set, causing boot menu entries to fail. This has been resolved.   + On USB-based rescue media, un-checking the "Check for devices missing drivers on boot" checkbox and rebuilding would sometimes not make the rescue media stop prompting for missing drivers. This has been resolved.   + When building Technicians media, failing to create autorun.inf will no longer cause the rescue media creation to abort.   + If the Windows ADK version 1607 was installed but a 64-bit PE 10 zip file was used to build rescue media, any subsequent 32-bit PE 10 builds would not prompt for an updated wim but would always use the 1607 wim from the ADK. This has been resolved.   + RMBuilder could fail to detect a new version of Windows RE after a Windows update. This has been resolved. |
|| **Bug fixes v7.2.4524 - Free Edition Only - 31st October 2019**   * **v7.2.4523 Error**   Internet access through a proxy server could cause v7.2.4523 Free Edition to receive a program error when checking for updates. This has been resolved. |
| --- |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4523 - 31st October 2019**   * **XP Boot Menu**   Windows XP can now handle boot menu creation when the 'C:' drive has the compressed attribute set. * **Auto System restore**   A "Backup is running" message box could be incorrectly shown on Windows Vista when performing an automatic restore. This has been resolved. * **SQL Continuous backup**   The Start end End time calculations didn't take into account the local time zone. This has been resolved. * **Rescue Media Builder**   + On multi-boot systems, Windows RE WIM files for a different architecture to the current OS will now be ignored when scanning.   + When building rescue media with a custom wim for a different architecture to the running OS (eg. a 32-bit custom wim on a 64-bit system), RMBuilder will now detect the architecture mismatch and will not try to copy drivers from the host OS.   + On Windows Vista, RMBuilder would sometimes give "WIM file not found" error messages when a valid Wim file was present. This has been resolved.   + Since Windows PE does not support wifi, Windows PE rescue media will no longer give Unsupported Devices messages for wifi devices.   + In certain cases, 64-bit drivers could be automatically copied into the 32-bit drivers folder. This has been resolved.   + USB root hubs will now be shown in the list of devices on RMBuilder's Devices And Drivers options tab.   + If the Windows ADK is installed but a newer version of Windows PE is available from a zip file, RMBuilder will now build rescue media from the zip file wim rather than the ADK wim..   + When performing an automatic restore on a system with multiple network adapters, the rescue media would sometimes not correctly set the network configuration for all adapters. This has been resolved.   + USB Devices in RMBuilder now show the volume label as well as the drive letter.   + The 'Backup Selection' dialog in Reflect and the 'Update Drivers' dialog in RMBuilder have been updated to allow for easier browsing for network folders. |
| **Bug fixes and Improvements v7.2.4473 - 23rd September 2019**   * **Server Core**   Reflect was unable to launch on Windows Server Core due to missing 'oledlg.dll' module. This has been resolved. * **Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Restore**   When exporting emails to EML file, the resulting EML file will now also include any email attachments. * **Macrium Image Guardian**   Emptying the Recycle Bin when it contains Macrium Reflect image files will no longer result in a "blocked file operation". * **Change Block Tracker**   + CBT will now be suspended if a reboot is pending following an upgrade install.   + On some systems, MRCBT could receive an malformed device remove notification for USB devices that would lead to a BSoD. This has been resolved.   + When tracking an encrypted VeraCrypt volume, CBT would receive a lock notification for the wrong device which would eventually lead to a BSoD. This has been resolved. * **Rescue Media**   + We've added a task bar button to take screenshots in PE.   + When making a backup through the rescue media, selecting "Shut down on completion" would sometimes reboot instead of shutting down. This has been resolved.   + By default, on systems without WiFi adapters, the "Add WiFi Support" advanced option checkbox will now be unchecked. Systems which have previously built rescue media will be unaffected.   + On systems with multiple network adapters, the rescue media would not always correctly load DHCP settings or other network settings for all adapters. This has been resolved.   + Manually added wifi drivers were not copied into non-WinRE rescue media builds. This has been resolved. * **Clone and Restore**   + The target list view for both clone and restore could fail to scroll to the last physical disk. This has been resolved.   + The "Restore Master Boot Record" settings in the Advanced dialog could fail to be applied. This has been resolved.   + Using Macrium Reflect English language on German systems could cause backups not to be shown in the restore view. This has been resolved.  - **Email**   * Notification email addresses with labels are now allowed. E.g, (FirstName LastName <fname.lname@example.com>).   * Notification emails with long subject lines are now permitted.- The notification email send date could be omitted from the SMTP header. This has been resolved |
| **Bug Fixes v7.2.4440 - 27th August 2019**   * **Program Error(BSoD)**   A system Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) could occur when imaging systems that contain ReFS formatted volumes. This has been resolved |
| **What's New v7.2.4433 - 20th August 2019**   * **Microsoft Exchange 2019**   Support has been added for Microsoft Exchange 2019 for backup, restore and granular restore. * **Update to TLS 1.2**   The email option in Macrium Reflect has been updated to include TLS 1.2 support. * **Rescue Media Files**   The driver folders for WinPE/WinRE have been expanded to support multiple architectures and WIM versions.   **Bug Fixes**   * **Changed Block Tracker**   The CBT communications protocol has been improved. **The first Incremental after installing may take longer than normal.** * **Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Restore**   During the same restore session if the same file was selected twice a mount error would be reported. This has been resolved. * **Microsoft Exchange Backup to GUID path**   The message "Not enough memory resources are available to process this command" could be displayed when backing up exchange to a volume guid path rather than a drive letter. This has been resolved. * **USB host driver copy**   USB devices could fail to be recognized if Windows PE/RE if the Rescue Media Builder had copied USB host drivers. This is now an optional setting in the RMBuilder 'Advanced' dialog and the defaulted operation for a fresh install is set to disabled. Please enable this option if necessary if you are having USB problems in the rescue media. * **Rescue Media BitLocker unlock**    The MS utility 'manage-bde.exe' could fail to run correctly in the rescue media. This has been resolved. **If this issue affects you then please re-create your rescue media after updating.** * **VSS Log Deletion Error**   VSS logs could be purged by date incorrectly. This has been resolved. * **Technicians USB**   The technicians license could be incorrectly copied to USB and ISO technicians media. This has been resolved. **If this issue affects you then please re-create your rescue media after updating.*** **Microsoft SQL Restore**     Server Plus could crash when attempting to restore the SQL tail log. This has been resolved.   * **viBoot Backup**     When creating a backup from within viBoot a password was prompted for even if the base image was not password protected. This has been resolved. |
| **What's New v7.2.4325 - 10th June 2019**   * **Macrium Technicians License**   We've improved the Technicians license product by adding the option to create a Technicians ISO image file and optical media. This offers the full functionality of the Technicians USB stick but also allows you to use it with Hyper-V VMs by attaching the ISO file to a DVD virtual device.* **Clone and Restore Confirmation**     We've added an additional confirmation check box when overwriting a Clone or Restore target disk. This offers Reflect users unfamiliar with the result of a Restore/Clone operation the opportunity to confirm or deny the overwrite operation.* **ReDeploy**       When attempting to ReDeploy Windows 7 using PE/RE 10 or Windows 10 using PE/RE 3.1 we now prevent IDE/ACHI services and drivers from being copied from the rescue media. This has caused un-bootable systems for some customers previously.* **Rescue media USB drivers**         Some customers have reported non-functioning USB devices which was corrected by updating the USB drivers in PE. Rescue media creation will now copy any USB OEM drivers from the host OS even if 'compatible' support is detected in the PE/RE base OS.* **Changed Block Tracker**           + The CBT tracking file format has been optimized and improved for efficiency and robustness. **This will require a reboot after installing and the first Incremental after reboot may take longer than normal.**           + CBT and Reflect now ignore the PortableBaseLayer virtual disk used by the Sandbox feature in Windows 10 build 1903.  - **Uninstall tidy up**   Unused .msi files in folder c:\windows\installer are now removed when uninstalling Macrium Reflect. - **File and Folder Search**   We've added path matching to the search criteria when searching File And Folder backups in the restore tab. Previously this was restricted to file names only.  **Bug Fixes**   * **Image mounting**   In rare cases images could refuse to mount if insufficient access privileges were assigned to the 'C:\Windows\Temp' folder. This has been resolved.* **Incorrect information in the Disk Details UI**     Directly after starting Reflect, incorrect information was shown in the 'Details' section of the Tasks list in the backup tab. This has been resolved.* **Rescue Media Builder**       + After uninstalling Reflect, the windows module 'Wimmount.sys' could be incorrectly registered leaving other applications unable to mount VHD files. This has been resolved       + Windows RE could fail to build on Server 2016. This has been resolved  - **BitLocker**   BitLocker 'live' restores may have reverted to BitLocker 'removal' restores after the last update. This has been resolved. **If this issue affects you then please re-create your rescue media after updating.**- **Changed Block Tracker**     CBT could be disabled for a volume after a reboot forced by running 'chkdsk /f'. This has been resolved. |
| **Server Plus Only - What's New v7.2.4230 - 22nd April 2019**  **Bug Fixes**   * **Image Guardian**   + MIG could block the creation of SQL backups. This has been resolved. |
| **What's New v7.2.4228 - 21st April 2019**   * **Image file loading speed improvement**   Reduced the time taken for Reflect to read the indexes back from the previous files in the backup set. This is most noticeable when reading a large number of remote files.   **Bug Fixes**   * **Change Block Tracker**   + Fixed an issue where a TRIM operation on a Registry hive would cause a dead-lock if some third-party software was holding a lock on the Registry.   + Fixed an issue where CBT could not be enabled on some volumes if the list of file extents for the NTFS $LogFile spanned a 512 byte boundary.  - **Image Guardian**   * Fixed an issue on some Windows 7 systems, where MIG was prevented from using the Microsoft cryptographic functions.   * MIG could block the creation of SQL backups. This has been resolved.- **viBoot**     Creating an Incremental image of an encrypted/password protected image would fail with invalid password. This has been resolved. |
| **What's New v7.2.4156 - 3rd April 2019**   * **Large NTFS Cluster Sizes**   Macrium Reflect now includes support for volumes formatted with the NTFS file-system that have a cluster size larger than 64K.   **Bug Fixes**   * **Change Block Tracker**   + On some system using Microsoft Storage Spaces the option to enable CBT could fail. This has now been resolved and CBT fully supports Storage Spaces.   + Performance Optimization. The frequency with which CBT flushes its internal state to disk has been reduced.  - **File and Folder Incorrect Progress Bar**   Reflect Monitor would show a sliding progress Marquee instead of the actual backup progress. This has been resolved. - **WinRE Wi-Fi Connection**   It was not aways possible to switch Wi-Fi networks when more than one network was available. This has been resolved. - **PEExplorer**   The PEExplorer application in the rescue media now includes a file deletion confirmation prompt. - **'psvolacc.sys' error when browsing Images in Windows PE/RE**   An incorrect error could be displayed when browsing images if the 'Enable access to restricted folders' option was selected in Windows PE/RE. This has been resolved - **License Key Edition Change**   When changing the installed edition of Macrium Reflect the previous license key could be retained after running the installer. This has been resolved - **BitLocker Removal Warning**   When resizing a restored BitLocker unlocked image the BitLocker Removal warning message box would not be displayed. This has been resolved - **Various**   Various small bug fixes and changes to improve Macrium Reflect. |
| **Bug Fixes v7.2.4063 - 18th February 2019**   * **Macrium Changed Block Tracker (MRCBT)**   CBT could fail to attach to volumes where the "System Volume Information" folder was compressed with NTFS compression. This has been resolved * **Macrium Virtual Image Boot (viBoot)**   The viBoot backup functionality has been put back - viBoot can now take backups of its VMs again. * **Backup Toast Notifications**   Duplicate toast notification when restoring have been removed.   When running backups, the toast notifications will now always show the backup definition file name. * **PowerShell**   PowerShell scripts running as scheduled tasks could hang after completion of a backup. This has been resolved. **Note:** Existing scripts do not need to change * **Server Plus - Mailbox Restore**   + Mailbox Restore will no longer incorrectly report failures when restoring to multiple mailboxes at once.   + If one message failed to restore then subsequent restores could cause a program exception. This has been resolved.   + In rare cases, Mailbox Restore on Exchange 2016 would fail to restore messages with certain extended properties. This has been resolved.   + On certain domain configurations, Mailbox Restore on Exchange 2016 would not always be able to restore to all mailboxes. This has been resolved.   + PST file export for Exchange 2016 is now supported. * **Server Plus - Exchange Backup**   Exchange backups can now handle backups of Databases and System volumes with different sector sizes.   Exchange encrypted Incremental backups could incorrectly force a Full backup. This has been resolved. * **Backup Logs**   Where consolidation/Retention rules are run \*before\* the start of a backup, the total time taken now includes the time taken for retention and consolidation.   File And Folder email settings now include warnings and are positioned in the same log section as Image logs. * **Various**   Various small bug fixes and changes to improve Macrium Reflect. |
| **Bug Fixes v7.2.3957 - 21st December 2018**   * **Macrium Changed Block Tracker (MRCBT)**   Some customers have experienced a Windows system exception causing a BSoD if the CBT feature was installed with v7.2.3954. This has been resolved. |
| **What's New v7.2.3954 - 17th December 2018**   * **Compatibility with Windows 10 Insider Preview 1809 (18290/8)**    System Image files can now be mounted in the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview release. We've worked around the Windows Container Isolation File System (wcifs) bug that caused a GSoD with earlier releases of Reflect.   **Bug Fixes**   * **Macrium Changed Block Tracker (MRCBT)**   The following issues have been resolved...   The number of error events that CBT writes to the System event log has been significantly reduced.   On some systems, CBT could cause a BSoD if a third-party device driver split a request to read or write from a volume into multiple, smaller reads or writes.   On some x86 systems, CBT could fail to read the NTFS transaction log due to a low memory condition. This resulted in a failed backup reporting a read error occurred due to insufficient system resources.

## Macrium Reflect is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to OPENSSLDIR location

#### Vulnerability Note VU#760767

Original Release Date: 2020-10-26 | Last Revised: 2020-11-11

---

### Overview

Macrium Reflect contains a privilege escalation vulnerability due to the use of an `OPENSSLDIR` variable that specifies a location where an unprivileged Windows user can create files.

### Description

**CVE-2020-10143**

Macrium Reflect includes an OpenSSL component that specifies an `OPENSSLDIR` variable as `C:\openssl\`. Macrium Reflect contains a privileged service that uses this OpenSSL component. Because unprivileged Windows users can create subdirectories off of the system root, a user can create the appropriate path to a specially-crafted `openssl.cnf` file to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

### Impact

By placing a specially-crafted `openssl.cnf` in the `C:\openssl\` directory, an unprivileged user may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a Windows system with the vulnerable Macrium software installed.

### Solution

#### Apply an update

This vulnerability is addressed in [Macrium Reflect v7.3.5281](https://updates.macrium.com/reflect/v7/v7.3.5281/details7.3.5281.htm).
