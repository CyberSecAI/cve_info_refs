Good afternoon ResponsiveFilemanager,

When i was doing a security test for a client of mine i noticed in your newest version of

ResponsiveFilemanager 9.13.4 ( in 9.14.0 the url upload is completly broken but it also exist there ) internal server side request forgery by adding to any php "/image.ico".

to reproduce this i reccomand to install ResponsiveFilemanager 9.13.4 and not ResponsiveFilemanager 9.14.0 because the url file uploader is completly broken and doesn't work at all even with legit jpeg's, but this version is also vulnerble.

you need to have url\_upload enabled and run the code on a apache server with default configurations.

now send as url

> <http://0.xip.io/server-status/favicon.ico>

when you send that go back to the file manager and you will see a ico.

download that file and rename favicon.ico to favicon.html.

if you now open that you will see the apache status page.

as you can see this is a clear indication that [CVE-2018-14728](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4954-r44g-wx43 "CVE-2018-14728") is bypassable.

how does this work:

there are a few problems here.

first you only use a regex to verify if it is a allowed url.

and in php files ( and sometimes html files ) it is allowed to extend the url.

this means if i would go to index.php/favicon.ico than the apache server would return index.php and not favicon.ico, but it would extend the url.

secondly i use dns pinning to bypass your miner filter to check if you send localhost because if you do a nslookup on "0.xip.io" you will get:

bl4ckh4ck5@bl4ckh4ck5-laptop:~/$ nslookup 0.xip.io

Server: 10.5.0.1

Address: 10.5.0.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:

Name: 0.xip.io

Address: 0.0.0.0

and 0.0.0.0 is localhost, but this method could also be used to access other ip's in the network.

a while back i created a potential patch against SSRF what might help against this problem:

<https://github.com/hackoclipse/ssrf-patch>

but i reccomand to make the design client side that the webbrowser downloads the image and than you use a xmlhttprequest to request the normal file upload, because that function isn't vulnerble.

i reccomand to fix both problems that url upload works again in 9.14.0 and that you fix this internal server side request forgery.

A CVE is already been requested.
