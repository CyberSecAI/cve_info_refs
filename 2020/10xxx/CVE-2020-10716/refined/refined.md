Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-10716:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control on the "User Input" entry within the Job Invocation feature of Red Hat Satellite. Specifically, the "User Input" field was not properly restricted, allowing unauthorized users to view its contents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of potentially sensitive data within the "User Input" field of Job Invocations. This includes passwords and other confidential information entered by users during job execution.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The flaw lies in the lack of proper access controls that would restrict viewing Job Invocations to authorized users who can execute them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:**  A malicious user with access to Job Invocations could scan through them and extract sensitive information, including plaintext passwords and other credentials.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Credentials:** An attacker could leverage exposed credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems or applications.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access to Red Hat Satellite:** An attacker with a valid account on Red Hat Satellite (but insufficient permissions to execute jobs) can exploit this.
*   **Exploitation of Job Invocation Feature:** Attackers exploit the lack of access controls to view the "User input" field in Job Invocations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Red Hat Satellite User Account:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Red Hat Satellite system.
*   **Access to Job Invocations:** The attacker must be able to access the Job Invocation functionality.
*   **No Need to Execute Jobs:** The vulnerability is not dependent on the ability to execute jobs, only view job invocations.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by restricting the ability to view Job Invocations to users authorized to execute them.
*   The fix is included in `tfm-rubygem-foreman_ansible` version 4.0.3.4.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in the RHSA-2020:1454 errata.

The provided Bugzilla entries confirm that this issue is related to insufficient access controls in Red Hat Satellite. Specifically, Bug 1827300 (CVE-2020-10716) describes that the user input from Job Invocations may contain sensitive data that is not properly restricted from view, thus leading to the vulnerability. The mentioned fix involves limiting the visibility of Job Invocation details to authorized users only, resolving the issue by improving access control. Bug 1814998, is related to this vulnerability, but access to this bug report is restricted.
