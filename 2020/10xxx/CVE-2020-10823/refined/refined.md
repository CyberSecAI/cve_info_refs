Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-10823:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the `/cgi-bin/activate.cgi` script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `activate.cgi` script copies the value of the `var` parameter to a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a POST request to `/cgi-bin/activate.cgi` with an overly long value for the `var` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable device. No prior authentication is needed.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code copies the `var` parameter using `memcpy` to a static buffer of size `0x10` (16 bytes) without checking the length of the input.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates sending a `var` parameter with a size of `0x1000` (4096 bytes).
- Affected products include: Vigor3900, Vigor2960, and Vigor300B before firmware version 1.5.1.
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-10824, which uses the `ticket` parameter.
