Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10996:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A bash script used for handling SST (State Snapshot Transfer) in Percona XtraDB Cluster had an error where it used a static key instead of generating a unique one for each transfer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Static Key Usage:** The primary weakness is the use of a static encryption key for SST file transfers. This means that if an attacker obtains the key, they can potentially decrypt any SST files transferred using that key.
- **Exposure of SST Data:** If an attacker gains access to the SST files and the static key, they can potentially access sensitive database data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can potentially decrypt and access sensitive database data contained in the SST files.
- **Compromise of Data Security:** The use of a static key undermines the encryption mechanism intended to secure data during SST.

**Attack vectors:**
- **File System Access:**  The primary attack vector is the attacker gaining access to the file system where SST files are stored.
- **Time-based Access:** The attacker needs time-based access to SST files as these files are ephemeral.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **File system access:** The attacker must have access to the file system of the Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes.
- **Knowledge of the static key:** The attacker must obtain the static key used for SST encryption.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to act within a limited time window before SST files are removed or rotated.
- **Enablement of InnoDB at-rest encryption:** The vulnerability is only exploitable when InnoDB at-rest encryption is enabled.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Percona XtraDB Cluster versions greater than 5.7.22-29.26 and less than 5.7.28-31.42.1.
- The issue was discovered by Pavel Kasko.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.7.28-31.41.2 and later versions.
