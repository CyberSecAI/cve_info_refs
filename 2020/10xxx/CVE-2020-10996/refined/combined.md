[![](data:image/svg+xml... "slamdata")](http://slamdata.com/)

## [SlamData](http://slamdata.com/)

SlamData is the leading provider of post relational analytics. Modern applications including IoT, social media and SaaS often create and store data in non-relational formats, including JSON, XML, or CSV. These formats do not fit easily into a relational data structure required for querying with existing analytics and BI tools. This forces organizations to build complex ETL processes or spend weeks attempting to wrangle the data. SlamData is the only solution that works natively against any data regardless of degree of structure. The open source solution allows users to explore, query and visualize complex data without any ETL or mapping, ever. User can easily embed reports and build interactive dashboards that reflect live data stored in MongoDB. SlamData powers analytics and reporting solutions for Fortune 500 companies, startups and government agencies. Itâs the go-to tool for software developers, data scientists, business intelligence professionals, product managers and more.

# CVE-2020-10996 â Percona XtraDB Cluster SST script static key

April 20, 2020

[David Busby](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/david-busby)

## **CVE-2020-10996**

Percona XtraDB Cluster versions greater than 5.7.22-29.26 and less than 5.7.28-31.42.1 contained a script that handled SST transfers to nodes, this was inadvertently set to a static value due to an error in the bash script handling this process.

## **Applicability**

Time based access to SST files is required in order to exploit this error, as sst files are ephemeral in nature the window in which an attacker with access to the filesystem can exploit this issue is limited.

In addition to the enablement of innodb at-rest encryption, which is not considered a GA feature at the time of writing.

## **Credits**

Percona would like to thank Pavel Kasko for discovering this issue, and working to aid resolution.

## **More Information**

* CVE-2020-10996
* <https://jira.percona.com/browse/PXC-3117>

## **Release notes**

# Percona Careers

Live and work from anywhere!

[Find your next role](#get-started)

### Remote by Design

Since its founding in 2006, Percona has always been a remote company. The reason? Itâs a tech company that knows how to use technology effectively and doesnât want to have geography limit its talent pool, said CEO Ann Schlemmer.
![](data:image/svg+xml...)

We have a high degree of trust with our staff. Leaders arenât checking to see what time workers log in each day or moni toring if their light on Slack is green. You canât have that sort of behavior and have an effective remote company. I have pride in how we live our values. Thatâs one of our values: We donât care where youâre located... If someone is a digital nomad and thatâs their lifestyle and that makes them happiest, I think that brings productivity. The goal is for employees to get their work done and then just enjoy life.â
![](data:image/svg+xml...)
**Ann Schlemmer**
CEO Percona

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

Every day at Percona, I am fortunate to collaborate with exceptional colleagues across every department, creating an environment where expertise is all around us. Our collective excellence is not only a daily inspiration, but it also raises the performance bar for everyone. I am truly grateful to be a part of a culture where our commitment to core values is palpable, driving our unwavering dedication to delivering for our customers, community, and colleagues. We rarely have a boring day here at Percona!â
![](data:image/svg+xml...)
**Bennie Grant**
COO Percona

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

What keeps me excited every day is Percona's unique culture and remote-only approach. It provides me with daily opportunities to collaborate with colleagues from all over the world, which enriches my work experience. We push boundaries, offer flexibility, and create a dynamic environment that fosters innovation and finding a better way. Percona is more than just a workplace; it is a global community of passionate experts, making it a great place to work.â
![](data:image/svg+xml...)
**Doug Miller**
SVP People & Culture Percona

# CVE-2020-10996 â Percona XtraDB Cluster SST script static key

April 20, 2020

[David Busby](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/david-busby)

## **CVE-2020-10996**

Percona XtraDB Cluster versions greater than 5.7.22-29.26 and less than 5.7.28-31.42.1 contained a script that handled SST transfers to nodes, this was inadvertently set to a static value due to an error in the bash script handling this process.

## **Applicability**

Time based access to SST files is required in order to exploit this error, as sst files are ephemeral in nature the window in which an attacker with access to the filesystem can exploit this issue is limited.

In addition to the enablement of innodb at-rest encryption, which is not considered a GA feature at the time of writing.

## **Credits**

Percona would like to thank Pavel Kasko for discovering this issue, and working to aid resolution.
