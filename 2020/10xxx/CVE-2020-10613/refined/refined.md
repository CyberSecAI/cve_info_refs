Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-10613:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, specifically related to data set descriptors when using DNP3 data sets. This lack of validation leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Read (CWE-125):** The software reads data past the end of an allocated structure due to insufficient validation of the length or boundaries of user-provided data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker can read sensitive data from the device's memory. The data could potentially contain configuration information, credentials, or other sensitive data that could be used for further attacks, however the main impact is disclosure only.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over a network.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication.
*   **DNP3 Data Sets:** The vulnerability is specifically applicable to installations using DNP3 Data Sets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable SCADA Data Gateway.
*   The attacker does not need any credentials to execute the attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities to potentially achieve code execution in the context of SYSTEM (Although CVE-2020-10613 itself is an out-of-bounds read, not code execution).
*   The affected software is Triangle MicroWorks SCADA Data Gateway, versions 2.41.0213 through 4.0.122.
*   The vulnerability was reported by the Incite Team, Tobias Scharnowski, Niklas Breitfeld, and Ali Abbasi, working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
*   Triangle MicroWorks recommends users update to Version 4.0.123.
*   The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 and a vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
