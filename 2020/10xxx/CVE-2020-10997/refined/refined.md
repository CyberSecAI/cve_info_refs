Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-10997:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Percona XtraBackup versions 2.4.11 and later had an issue where the entire command line used to invoke the backup process was captured and output to the resulting backup file location.
*   Additionally, when the `--history` command line argument was used, the command line was also stored in the `PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history` table within the MySQL server.
*   The command line arguments were also present in the process list and standard error output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the command line arguments used during the backup process, which could include sensitive information such as:
    *   Database credentials (username, password if provided directly in the command line).
    *   Hostnames or IP addresses of servers.
    *   File paths and other potentially sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker who gains access to the backup files, the MySQL server (with `--history` argument), process list or standard error output, could extract sensitive information from the command line arguments. This could lead to:
    *   Unauthorized access to the database server.
    *   Further attacks on other systems using the disclosed information.
    *   Data breaches and compromise of confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Backup File Access:** Unauthorized access to the backup files themselves.
*   **MySQL Server Access:** Authenticated access to the MySQL server, if the `--history` argument was used during the backup.
*   **System Access:** Access to the Linux system on which Percona XtraBackup (PXB) was executed.
*   **Process List/Standard Error Output:** Access to the process list meta data or standard error output.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to backup files:** An attacker needs access to the backup files generated by Percona XtraBackup.
*   **Authenticated Access to MySQL Server:** If the `--history` argument was used, an attacker needs authenticated access to the MySQL server.
*   **System Access:** The attacker may need access to the Linux system where PXB is executed to access process list or standard error output.
*   **Process List Access**: Ability to access process list meta data.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Percona XtraBackup versions 2.4.20 or later, or 8.0.11 or later, where the issue was resolved.

**Additional Information:**

* The vulnerability was discovered by Zsolt Paragi.
* The issue is tracked in Percona's Jira system with ticket IDs PXB-2142, PXB-2145, PXB-2152, and PXB-2154.
