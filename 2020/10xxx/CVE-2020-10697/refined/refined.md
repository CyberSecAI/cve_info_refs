Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insecure deployment of memcached within Ansible Tower when running on OpenShift. The memcached instance is exposed via TCP and accessed through a domain socket shared between containers within OpenShift.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Memcached Deployment:** The memcached service is exposed via TCP and accessible through a shared domain socket, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access from other containers on the same OpenShift deployment.
*   **Lack of Access Control:**  The shared domain socket and lack of proper authentication on the memcached service allows other containers within the same OpenShift environment to interact with it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can pollute the memcached cache by writing a large number of entries, causing a degradation in the performance of Ansible Tower. In a worst-case scenario, this could severely reduce Tower's performance, impacting its availability.
*   **Potential Data Manipulation:**  A sophisticated attacker could potentially manipulate and craft the cache, as Ansible Tower relies on memcached to retrieve setting values.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker can access the memcached service via TCP through the shared domain socket within the OpenShift environment.
*   **Lateral Movement:** An attacker who has compromised one container within the OpenShift deployment can exploit this vulnerability to interact with the exposed memcached instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised Container:** The attacker needs to have access to a container running within the same OpenShift environment as the vulnerable Ansible Tower instance.
*   **Network Access to Shared Domain Socket:** The attacker needs the capability to communicate with the memcached service through the shared domain socket.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Confidential and sensitive data stored in memcached should not be pulled, as this information is encrypted
*   The vulnerability affects Ansible Tower versions 3.4.5, 3.5.5, 3.6.3 and prior versions when deployed on OpenShift.
*   There was no mitigation for this issue at the time of reporting.
*   The issue was fixed in ansible\_tower versions 3.6.4, 3.5.6 and 3.4.6
