{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The gluster-block utility logs the output from gluster-block CLI operations, including sensitive information such as passwords, to the cmd_history.log and gluster-blockd.log files. These log files are world-readable by default.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure due to logging sensitive data in world-readable log files."
    ],
    "impact": "Local users can obtain sensitive information, such as passwords used for CHAP authentication, by reading the log files. This can lead to unauthorized access and compromise of the block storage.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system where gluster-block is installed."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to read files on the local file system where gluster-block is installed."
    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present in gluster-block versions prior to 0.5.1. The log files `cmd_history.log` and `gluster-blockd.log` store the output from CLI commands, including passwords and other sensitive details when debug logging is enabled."
