{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The /proc/sys/kernel/rh_features file, readable by unprivileged users, copies a chunk of uninitialized memory to user space if no tracked feature is used. This is due to a flaw in the Linux kernel's sysctl subsystem when reading this file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory disclosure",
       "Reading uninitialized memory"
    ],
    "impact": "A local, unprivileged user can read uninitialized values from kernel memory, potentially disclosing sensitive information. The size and location of the memory being read is not controlled by the user, and it may often be empty or contain nothing of interest.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access to the system",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Unprivileged user access"
  },
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present only in RHEL 8 and was introduced in RHEL 8.2 by kernel commit b42078ac845a. The issue is rated as having low impact due to the limited and random (non-controllable by attacker) nature of the memory disclosure. Patches were released via RHSA-2020:4431 and RHSA-2020:4609. The file /proc/sys/kernel/rh_features is the attack vector"
