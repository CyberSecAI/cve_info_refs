- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper privilege management within the Portico Remote desktop control software. Specifically, a user with limited access can start a shell with administrator rights via the Import/Export configuration dialog.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local privilege escalation. The software, when running as a service, allows a low-privilege user to gain administrator privileges by exploiting the Import/Export configuration dialog.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can gain full administrator privileges on the system running the vulnerable Portico software.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. The attacker needs to have some level of access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with limited access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed and running as a service.
