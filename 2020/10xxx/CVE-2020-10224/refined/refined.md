Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution

**Root Cause:** The Online Book Store 1.0 application has an insecure file upload functionality within the `/admin_add.php` page. This allows an unauthenticated user to upload a PHP web shell disguised as an image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the application doesn't require authentication to access the file upload functionality.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not perform proper validation or sanitization on the uploaded file.
*   **Insecure File Storage:** Uploaded files are placed in the `/bootstrap/img/` directory, which is directly accessible by the webserver.
*   **Shell Execution via GET Parameter:** The uploaded web shell executes system commands via the `cmd` GET parameter, and the application also doesn't validate the `cmd` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by uploading a web shell and using the `cmd` parameter.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** The RCE can lead to complete compromise of the server if the attacker leverages it to gain further privileges.
*  **Data Theft or Manipulation:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data or modify data on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker sends a specially crafted POST request to `/admin_add.php`, containing the malicious PHP web shell disguised as an image in the `image` parameter, and `add=1` in the data parameters.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** After the upload, the attacker sends a GET request to the location of the uploaded file using the GET parameter `cmd` to execute arbitrary commands

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials or any sort of authentication.
* **Knowledge of the URL:** The attacker needs the URL of the vulnerable application

**Additional Details:**

The provided exploit code shows the step-by-step approach for exploiting this vulnerability:
1. Sends a POST request to `/admin_add.php` with a PHP web shell payload masquerading as an image file.
2. Sends a GET request to the uploaded file with a test command to verify the shell execution.
3. If the shell is successfully uploaded, a prompt appears to launch the shell, then the attacker can continuously send new commands to the server via the `cmd` parameter.
