  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of a mechanism to prevent booting from a live OS image.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The system allows booting from a live OS image, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exfiltration of sensitive files (e.g., shadow file) and privilege escalation by adding a new user with sudo privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Booting the target machine from a live OS image.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Physical access to the machine to boot from a live image."
