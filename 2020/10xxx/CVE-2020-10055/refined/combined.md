WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• If the extension module Advanced Reporting is already installed, apply the patch as documented

above

• In all other cases avoid the installation of the extension module from existing deliveries of Desigo
CC or Desigo CC Compact software, until you receive an updated version of the software that
includes the patch already.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to

run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Desigo CC is the integrated building management platform for managing high-performing buildings. With
its open design, it has been developed to create comfortable, safe and efﬁcient facilities. It is easily
scalable from simple single-discipline systems to fully integrated buildings.

Desigo CC Compact extends the portfolio with a tailored solution for small and medium-sized buildings.

Advanced Reporting for Desigo CC and Desigo CC Compact is an optional extension module that allows
customers to create sophisticated reports with many widgets (e.g. bar-charts, . . . ) to monitor and compare
over time selected KPIs.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-10055

Affected applications are delivered with a 3rd party component (BIRT) that contains a remote code
execution vulnerability if the Advanced Reporting Engine is enabled.

The vulnerability could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the
server with SYSTEM privileges.
