- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Advanced Reporting module for Desigo CC and Desigo CC Compact includes a third-party component (BIRT) that has a remote code execution vulnerability when the Advanced Reporting Engine is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Code injection (CWE-94).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with SYSTEM privileges. This can lead to a complete compromise of the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have network access to the affected system. No prior authentication is needed. The attacker must target a server where the Advanced Reporting module is installed and the Advanced Reporting Engine is enabled.
