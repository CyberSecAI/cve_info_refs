## Notes

---

### [mdeslaur](https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur)

This was fixed in the rpi firmware release 1.2-4+rpt8 included
in the 4-0ubuntu1 Ubuntu package.
This is fixed in 6-0ubuntu0~20.04.1 in focal-updates, and
4-0ubuntu0~18.04.1 in bionic-updates, but are not in the
-security pocket.
The affected firmware files don't appear to be in the
bluez-firmware package at all.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2052676#c0)  Vipul Nair    2022-02-09 18:43:57 UTC  ``` An update was found in the Raspberry Pi foundation git reopistory with the following message: "Bluetooth firmware update works around most of the report "Spectra" class of vulnerabilities. [CVE-2020-10370](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10370) will be addressed in a follow-up release."  I suppose the fixed CVEs are: [CVE-2020-10367](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10367) [CVE-2020-10368](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10368) [CVE-2020-10369](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10369)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2052676#c1)  Peter Robinson    2022-02-09 22:39:58 UTC  ``` So there's so many unanswered questions in your statement: 1) bluez doesn't ship firmware it's purely userspace software 2) we don't ship bluetooth firmware that works with the Raspberry Pi as it's not upstream in linux-firmware (see the bugs against that about that) 3) the raspberry pi devices have a number of wireless modules from a number of vendors which of those are affected.  I also don't have access to the blocking RHBZ so I can't see what else is there (and yes I'm a RHer).

Are you sure that this one is with "raspberry pi devices" devices only? Looking to the sub [CVE-2020-10367](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10367) it is "Code execution on a Broadcom Bluetooth chip leads to code execution within Wi-Fi".  Why this chip could not be with other platforms that we support?  Seeing what currently already included to rhel*: "ls /lib/firmware/brcm/bcm43 bcm4329-fullmac-4.bin  bcm43xx-0.fw           bcm43xx_hdr-0.fw " , so maybe will have to ship broadcom/BCM43430A1.hcd broadcom/BCM4345C0.hcd broadcom/BCM43430A1.hcd broadcom/BCM4345C0.hcd also?  Keeping this flaw open, even maybe could be closed later as NOTABUG if only for Raspberry Pi and if no Red Hat products compatible with related chips.  If I understand right, these three patches (for the bluez-firmware) are related to this CVE: <https://github.com/RPi-Distro/bluez-firmware/commit/98cbd44897277502200537dbacbe53a22def0417> <https://github.com/RPi-Distro/bluez-firmware/commit/afe608e7055a0c8d80c9430e16993e6219e46c93> <https://github.com/RPi-Distro/bluez-firmware/commit/ba01b70ddf3fcccb47895d885724919da045421f> (info taken from <https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1176631> ).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2052676#c5)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-02-10 13:51:34 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-10370>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2052676#c6)  Peter Robinson    2022-02-10 14:53:25 UTC  ``` > Why this chip could not be with other platforms that we support?  It could be but it's not a bluez bug as stated in the title. It would be linux-firmware. BUT there's 3 vendors that ship brcmfmac HW - Broadcom, Infineon/Cypress and Synaptics. The Raspberry Pi has HW, as do other HW vendors, from all 3 of those suppliers. If for example it's only relevant to Synaptics HW we're no vulnerable as we don't ship any synaptics firmware. That's why we need more information to work out what actually is or is not vulnerable.   ``` |  |

# Spectra: Neue SicherheitslÃ¼cken bei drahtlosen Chips

## Forschende des Secure Mobile Networking Lab und der UniversitÃ¤t Brescia finden Schwachstelle

07.08.2020

Drahtlose Chips, wie sie in vielen modernen GerÃ¤ten eingebaut sind, weisen ein Sicherheitsrisiko auf. Das konnten Jiska Classen von der TU Darmstadt und Francesco Gringoli von der UniversitÃ¤t Brescia auf der Blackhat- und der DefCon-Konferenz zeigen.

![SPECTRA Jiska Claassen]()

Laboraufbau zur Analyse der seriellen Koexistenz-Schnittstelle zwischen einem Bluetooth-Board und einem WLAN-Board von Cypress.

Aktuelle drahtlose Technologien teilen sich zunehmend das selbe Spektrum â sie Ã¼bermitteln Daten auf den selben FrequenzbÃ¤ndern. Dies ist sowohl bei Bluetooth als auch bei WLAN der Fall, aber sogar bei einigen benachbarten LTE-BÃ¤ndern. Da sie sich diese Frequenzen teilen, mÃ¼ssen drahtlose Technologien den Spektrumszugriff koordinieren, um Kollisionen zu vermeiden. Allerdings ermÃ¶glicht diese Koordination eine neue Angriffsklasse, welche von Dr.-Ing Jiska Classen (TU Darmstadt, [Secure Mobile Networking Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/seemoo/seemoo/index.en.jsp)) und Prof. Francesco Gringoli (UniversitÃ¤t Brescia) entdeckt wurde.

Ein Angreifer, welcher auf einem Bluetooth-Chip Schadcode ausfÃ¼hren kann, kann von dort aus in den WLAN-Chip eskalieren und auch dort Schadcode ausfÃ¼hren. Diese neuen Schwachstellen namens Spectra zeigen, dass Spektrumskoordination Angreifern ermÃ¶glicht, Grenzen zwischen drahtlosen Chips zu Ã¼berschreiten. Hierdurch werden Angriffe auf unterschiedliche drahtlose Protokolle und Technologien Ã¤quivalent. Spectra-Angriffe funktionieren auf modernen GerÃ¤ten wie iPhones, MacBooks oder Samsung-Smartphones mit den neuesten Sicherheitsupdates, obwohl diese LÃ¼cke bereits Anfang diesen Jahres an die Hersteller gemeldet wurde, weil die darunterliegende Schwachstelle die Hardware betrifft.

### Spectra ermÃ¶glicht neue Angriffswege

Spectra basiert darauf, dass Datenpakete Ã¼ber das selbe Spektrum Ã¼bermittelt werden und drahtlose Chips hierfÃ¼r den Spektrumszugriff koordinieren mÃ¼ssen. Sogenannte Koexistenzmechanismen, welche den Spektrumszugriff vermitteln, sind essentiell fÃ¼r hochperformante drahtlose Kommunikation. Nur durch Koexistenz wird es beispielsweise mÃ¶glich, ein Video Ã¼ber WLAN zu streamen und dieses gleichzeitig Ã¼ber Bluetooth-KopfhÃ¶rer abzuspielen, obwohl beide das 2.4GHz-Band nutzen. Manche Koexistenzmechanismen kÃ¶nnen in die drahtlose Ãbertragung integriert werden. Allerdings ist dies nicht ausreichend bei Chips, die nah beieinander positioniert sind oder sogar die selbe Antenne nutzen, wie dies bei Smartphones der Fall ist.

Bei Koexistenzmechanismen handelt es sich hÃ¤ufig um serielle Schnittstellen zwischen den Chips, die Teil der Hardware sind, um paketbasierte Echtzeitentscheidungen zur DatenÃ¼bertragung treffen zu kÃ¶nnen. Obwohl Koexistenz nur die Performanz bei der DatenÃ¼bertragung erhÃ¶hen sollte, fÃ¼hrt sie auch zu interessanten SeitenkanÃ¤len. Herstellerspezifische Erweiterungen kÃ¶nnen hierbei sogar die AusfÃ¼hrung von Code auf anderen Chips ermÃ¶glichen. Da Koexistenz in der Hardware drahtloser Chips implementiert ist, kÃ¶nnen Betriebssysteme nicht vor Angriffen auf diese schÃ¼tzen.

Spectra ermÃ¶glicht neue Angriffswege. Typischerweise wÃ¼rde ein Angreifer von einem drahtlosen Chip aus versuchen, in das Betriebssystem zu gelangen. Im Gegensatz hierzu ermÃ¶glicht Spectra, dass ein Angreifer vom Bluetooth-Chip in den WLAN-Chip gelangen kann und dann beispielsweise von dort aus in das Betriebssystem. Desweiteren erlauben nun Schwachstellen im Bluetooth-Teil des Betriebssystems Ã¼ber den Weg der Chips auch in WLAN-Komponenten einzudringen. Bluetooth hatte in der Vergangenheit schon sehr hÃ¤ufig SicherheitslÃ¼cken und ist deshalb gut abgegrenzt von anderen Komponenten, aber Spectra erlaubt nun neue Angriffswege, um solche Grenzen zu Ã¼berschreiten.

### âHunderte von Millionen GerÃ¤te betroffenâ

Professor Francesco Gringoli, der sich mit der RÃ¼ckwÃ¤rtsentwicklung von WLAN-Chips beschÃ¤ftigt hat, und Dr.-Ing. Jiska Classen, Sicherheitsexpertin fÃ¼r drahtlose Kommunikation mit Fokus auf Bluetooth, haben ihr Wissen vereint um Spectra-Angriffe gegen drahtlose Kombinations-Chips der Hersteller Broadcom und Cypress entdeckt. Diese Chips sind in vielen beliebten GerÃ¤ten, wie zum Beispiel allen iPhones, MacBooks, der Samsung Galaxy S Serie, Raspberry Pis und Fitnesstrackern. Obwohl die Forschenden diese Chips genutzt haben, um konkrete Angriffe umzusetzen, betrifft die allgemeine Angriffsklasse auch andere Hersteller, welche im Rahmen der verantwortlichen Offenlegung dieser LÃ¼cken ebenfalls informiert wurden.

[Professor Matthias Hollick vom Secure Mobile Networking Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/seemoo/team_seemoo/matthias_hollick/index.en.jsp), an dem die Arbeiten stattgefunden haben, ergÃ¤nzt: âDie hier gefundene Schwachstelle ist fundamental neu. Sie betrifft hunderte von Millionen GerÃ¤te, deren Hersteller noch nach Wegen suchen, diesen neuen Angriffsvektor dauerhaft zu beseitigen.â

Die Spectra-Angriffe Ã¼berwinden die Abtrennung zwischen WLAN und Bluetooth auf Kobminations-Chips, bei denen die beiden Technologien auf unterschiedlichen Kernen ausgefÃ¼hrt werden. Hierbei konnten drei Arten von Koexistenz-Angriffen umgesetzt werden:

* Zugriffsverweigerung: Ein drahtloser Kern verhindert, dass der andere drahtlose Kern Daten sendet.
* AusspÃ¤hen von Informationen: Ein drahtloser Kern ermittelt Details Ã¼ber die TÃ¤tigkeiten des anderen drahtlosen Kerns.
* CodeausfÃ¼hrung: Ein drahtloser Kern kann auf dem anderen drahtlosen Kern Schadcode ausfÃ¼hren.

### Schwachstellen liegen in der Hardware

Sicherheitsupdates gegen Spectra wurden etwa im MÃ¤rz 2020 fÃ¼r iOS und Android ausgerollt und verhindern nun, dass Angreifer vom Betriebssystem aus in den RAM des Bluetooth-Chips schreiben kÃ¶nnen, was wiederum CodeausfÃ¼hrung in WLAN ermÃ¶glichen wÃ¼rde. Auf gerooteten GerÃ¤ten kÃ¶nnen diese Patches jedoch deaktiviert werden. Das Deaktivieren dieser Patches zeigt, dass bis auf diesen Teil des Angriffsweges keinerlei Schwachstellen, die in der Hardware selbst vorliegen, behoben wurden.

Ein Angreifer mit Kontrolle Ã¼ber den Bluetooth-Chip kann nach wie vor Schadcode in Wi-Fi ausfÃ¼hren. Dies wurde von den Sicherheitsforschern auf dem aktuellen GerÃ¤ten getestet: iOS 13.6 fÃ¼r das iPhone 8, macOS 10.15.5 auf einem MacBook Pro 2019/2020, sowie Android 9 mit dem Patchlevel Juli 2020 auf einem Samsung Galaxy S8. Die LÃ¼cken wurden wahrscheinlich deshalb nicht behoben, weil die Ursache fÃ¼r Spectra in der Hardware selbst liegt. Die betriebssystemseitigen Patches reduzieren zwar die Angriffswege teilweise, erschweren aber vor allem die Analyse der Patches in der Hardware selbst.

Spectra benÃ¶tigt vergleichsweise starke Angriffsvoraussetzungen, wie beispielsweise das Beobachten genauer Sendezeitpunkte von Paketen oder gar das AusfÃ¼hren von Code in einem drahtlosen Kern. Allerdings ist es schwierig bis unmÃ¶glich, Spectra-basierte Angriffe zu verhindern, ohne schwerwiegende Performanznachteile in Kauf zu nehmen. Manche Chip-Hersteller kombinieren sogar mehrere drahtlose Technologien in einem Kern, und es gibt viele undokumentierte, proprietÃ¤re Koexistenzmechanismen. Deshalb sollten Nutzer, die sicher gegen drahtlose Angriffe sein mÃ¶chten, konsequenterweise sÃ¤mtliche drahtlose Kommunikation deaktivieren und nicht nur eine einzelne drahtlose Technologie.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2052676#c0)  Vipul Nair    2022-02-09 18:43:57 UTC  ``` An update was found in the Raspberry Pi foundation git reopistory with the following message: "Bluetooth firmware update works around most of the report "Spectra" class of vulnerabilities.

Are you sure that this one is with "raspberry pi devices" devices only? Looking to the sub [CVE-2020-10367](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10367) it is "Code execution on a Broadcom Bluetooth chip leads to code execution within Wi-Fi".  Why this chip could not be with other platforms that we support?  Seeing what currently already included to rhel*: "ls /lib/firmware/brcm/bcm43 bcm4329-fullmac-4.bin  bcm43xx-0.fw           bcm43xx_hdr-0.fw " , so maybe will have to ship broadcom/BCM43430A1.hcd broadcom/BCM4345C0.hcd broadcom/BCM43430A1.hcd broadcom/BCM4345C0.hcd also?  Keeping this flaw open, even maybe could be closed later as NOTABUG if only for Raspberry Pi and if no Red Hat products compatible with related chips.  If I understand right, these three patches (for the bluez-firmware) are related to this CVE: <https://github.com/RPi-Distro/bluez-firmware/commit/98cbd44897277502200537dbacbe53a22def0417> <https://github.com/RPi-Distro/bluez-firmware/commit/afe608e7055a0c8d80c9430e16993e6219e46c93> <https://github.com/RPi-Distro/bluez-firmware/commit/ba01b70ddf3fcccb47895d885724919da045421f> (info taken from <https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1176631> ).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2052676#c5)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-02-10 13:51:34 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-10370>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2052676#c6)  Peter Robinson    2022-02-10 14:53:25 UTC  ``` > Why this chip could not be with other platforms that we support?  It could be but it's not a bluez bug as stated in the title. It would be linux-firmware. BUT there's 3 vendors that ship brcmfmac HW - Broadcom, Infineon/Cypress and Synaptics. The Raspberry Pi has HW, as do other HW vendors, from all 3 of those suppliers. If for example it's only relevant to Synaptics HW we're no vulnerable as we don't ship any synaptics firmware. That's why we need more information to work out what actually is or is not vulnerable.   ``` |  |
