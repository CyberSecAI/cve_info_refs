{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists in certain Cypress and Broadcom Wireless Combo chips, specifically CYW43455, when a specific Bluetooth firmware update (2021-01-26) is not present.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The lack of the specified Bluetooth firmware update allows for a 'Spectra' attack, which results in a Bluetooth outage.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of the vulnerability leads to a Bluetooth outage on affected devices.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed over Bluetooth via the 'Spectra' attack method.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to exploit the 'Spectra' vulnerability, which appears to involve manipulating the Bluetooth communication at a low level. Code execution on the Bluetooth chip is also mentioned as a possible attack vector for escalation to Wi-Fi."
