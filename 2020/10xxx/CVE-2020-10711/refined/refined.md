Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided content related to CVE-2020-10711:

**Root Cause:**

*   The SELinux network label handling implementation in the Linux kernel could be coerced into de-referencing a NULL pointer.
*   Specifically, the issue arises during the import of a Commercial IP Security Option (CIPSO) protocol's category bitmap into SELinuxâ€™s extensible bitmap via the `ebitmap_netlbl_import` routine.
*   The `cipso_v4_parsetag_rbm` routine sets the security attribute indicating a category bitmap is present, even if the bitmap hasn't been allocated, leading to the NULL pointer dereference when that bitmap is used later.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **NULL pointer dereference:** The core vulnerability lies in the possibility of de-referencing a NULL pointer, which leads to a system crash.
*   **Improper handling of CIPSO category bitmaps:** The code fails to properly handle situations where the category bitmap is expected but not allocated, and doesn't properly validate if the bitmap is allocated before referencing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit results in a denial of service due to a system crash (kernel panic).
*  **Information Exposure** Local attacker could expose kernel private memory to userspace when triggering core dump functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending a specially crafted CIPSO packet to the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system.
*   **No privilege required:** Exploitation does not require any particular privileges on the target system.
*   **Network access:** Attacker must be able to reach the system over the network.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel's SELinux subsystem, specifically within the network label handling implementation, and was introduced by a particular commit related to fixing catmap functions.
*   The vulnerability arises from improper handling of CIPSO packets, where a null category can trigger a NULL pointer dereference within the SELinux module.
*   The vulnerability is present in the kernel prior to version 5.7 and several backports are required to resolve the issue.

**Note:**

*   Some sources clarify that this issue does not affect the binary packages distributed in Debian as the `CONFIG_NETLABEL` option is not enabled.
* One source also mentions that there is a use-after-free read in `napi_gro_frags()`, which is a separate CVE but listed in the same update for some distributions.
