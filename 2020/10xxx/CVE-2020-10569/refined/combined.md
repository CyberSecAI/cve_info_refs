## Wondering if on-premises is right for you?

      ![icon](data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=ODIxOjExNg==-1;base64...)

You will need to install the software on your servers and are responsible for managing both the servers and the software. This includes SysAid upgrades, hardware maintenance, operating system maintenance, and security patches.

      ![icon](data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=ODMxOjExNg==-1;base64...)

There are 4 releases a year, whereas with SysAid Cloud, upgrades are automatically deployed every 2 weeks.
