## CVE-2020-10724

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
The vhost-crypto library code in DPDK versions 18.11 and above lacks input validation for user-supplied values. Specifically, the `transform_cipher_param()` and `transform_chain_param()` functions do not properly validate the lengths of the cipher key, digest, and authentication key buffers against the maximum allowed lengths (VHOST_USER_CRYPTO_MAX_CIPHER_KEY_LENGTH and VHOST_USER_CRYPTO_MAX_HMAC_KEY_LENGTH).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
- Missing input validation: Failure to validate user-provided lengths for cryptographic parameters against predefined maximum values.
- Out-of-bounds read: When processing payload data, the code reads beyond the allocated buffer boundaries due to missing length checks.

**Impact of exploitation**:
- Information leak: An attacker can potentially leak sensitive data by triggering an out-of-bounds memory read.
- Crash: The out-of-bounds memory read may lead to a crash of the application, resulting in denial of service.

**Attack vectors**:
- Vhost-user backend: A malicious guest/container with direct access to the vhost-user socket can send crafted messages to exploit this vulnerability.
- Crafted Messages: The attacker sends messages containing malicious lengths for cipher keys, digest, and authentication keys.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
- Direct access to the vhost-user socket: The attacker needs to have a malicious guest or container running that has a direct connection to the vhost-user socket.
- Ability to send crafted messages: The attacker must be able to construct and send malicious messages to the vhost-user backend application.
- A privileged account in a vhost-user configuration (High privileges)
