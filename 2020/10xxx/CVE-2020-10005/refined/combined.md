# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2021-1246

## Apple macOS SMB server TREE\_CONNECT stack buffer overflow vulnerability

##### June 2, 2021

##### CVE Number

CVE-2020-10005

### Summary

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the SMB Server Apple macOS 10.15.7. A specially crafted SMB packet can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, which can lead to arbitrary code execution and denial of service. This vulnerability can be triggered by sending a malicious packet to the vulnerable server.

### Tested Versions

Apple macOS Catalina 10.15.7

### Product URLs

<https://apple.com>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-121 - Stack-based Buffer Overflow

### Details

macOS is a series of proprietary operating systems developed by Apple. Among other services, macOS contains a proprietary implementation of an SMB server to support network file sharing.

Server Message Block (SMB) is a network file sharing protocol widely used in Windows network environments and macOS contains a proprietary implementation of both server and client components. SMB is often used in office and enterprise environments for file and printer sharing.

Three distinct versions and multiple dialects of SMB protocol are supported by macOS’ SMB server. This vulnerability is present in SMB2 and newer versions of the protocol, more specifically in the `TREE_CONNECT` request processing. `TREE_CONNECT` request is used to connect to a specified SMB share and has a relatively simple structure consisting of structure size, flags, path offset, path length and a utf16 string specifying a path. When processing the `TREE_CONNECT` request, function `smb2_dispatch_tree_connect` is invoked. First, parts of the `TREE_CONNECT` structure are extracted by calling the appropriate `smb2::extract` method:

```
__text:0000000100002C5E lea     rdi, [rbp+pTreeConnectBuffer] ; this
__text:0000000100002C65 mov     [rdi], rsi
__text:0000000100002C68 lea     rsi, [rbp+var_868]
__text:0000000100002C6F mov     [rsi], rdx
__text:0000000100002C72 lea     rcx, [r15+90h]
__text:0000000100002C79 lea     rdx, [rbp+tree_connect_request_extracted]
__text:0000000100002C7D call    smb2::extract(uchar *&,uchar * const&,smb2::tree_connect_request &,uchar * const&)

```

Calling `smb::extract` will extract the utf16 path string as well as its length. Shortly following that is a `memcpy` call:

```
__text:0000000100002CCF cmovs   rsi, rax        ; void *
__text:0000000100002CD3 lea     edx, [rbx+rbx]  ; size_t
__text:0000000100002CD6 lea     r12, [rbp+wcSharePath]
__text:0000000100002CDD mov     rdi, r12        ; void *
__text:0000000100002CE0 call    _memcpy

```

From the above, we can observe that destination for the `memcpy` call is a stack buffer `rbp+wcSharePath`, source is previously extracted pointer to path string and length is the specified length from the `TREE_CONNECT` structure. Since the local stack buffer `wcSharePath` is located in the stack and of static size this can constitute a straightforward stack buffer overflow. Indeed, looking up stack layout of this function reveals that `wcSharePath` is 2048 bytes. Therefore, a specially crafted `TREE_CONNECT` request packet with a very long share path utf16 string can result in a buffer overflow. This can be observed in a debugger:

```

First, a breakpoint is set at `smb2_dispatch_tree_connect` to observe `TREE_CONNECT` buffer from our crafted packet. Continuing execution till `memcpy` call lets us observe the parameters:

```
Process 32047 stopped
* thread #3, queue = 'com.apple.root.default-qos', stop reason = instruction step over

(lldb) mem read $rdx

```

Notice that `rdi` is an address on the stack, `rsi` points to a path buffer and `rdx` (length) matches buffer size from `TREE_CONNECT` request packet. Continuing execution forward results in:

```

(lldb)

```

The above shows a write access violation when trying to write to address pointed to by `rax` which is clearly under control. Depending on the stack structures that were overwritten, the crash could happen at a different place. Additionally, while this particular function has stack cookie check enabled, there are number of other locals, and those of other stack frames, stack variables that could be overwritten which could lead to further memory corruption and ultimately arbitrary code execution.
