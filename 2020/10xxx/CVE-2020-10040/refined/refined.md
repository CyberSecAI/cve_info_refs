- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The device stores passwords in clear text, making them retrievable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort (CWE-916). This indicates that the passwords are not properly hashed or encrypted before storage.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can retrieve passwords in clear text, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the device or other systems using those passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the device is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the device but does not require any prior authentication.
