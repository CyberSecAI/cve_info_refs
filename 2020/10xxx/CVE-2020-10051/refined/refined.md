- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple services of the affected application are executed with SYSTEM privileges, and the call path is not quoted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unquoted Search Path or Element (CWE-428).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can inject arbitrary commands that are executed instead of the legitimate service, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low-privileged access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
