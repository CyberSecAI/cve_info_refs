Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-10743:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Kibana instance distributed with OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) did not set the `X-Frame-Options` header by default. This allowed the Kibana interface to be embedded within an iframe, making it vulnerable to clickjacking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing `X-Frame-Options` header: The primary vulnerability is the lack of the `X-Frame-Options` header in the HTTP response from the Kibana instance. This header is designed to prevent clickjacking attacks.
- Clickjacking vulnerability: The absence of the header allows an attacker to embed the Kibana UI within a malicious webpage, which can be used to trick users into unknowingly performing actions on the Kibana interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could trick a user into performing arbitrary actions in OCP's distribution of Kibana without the user's consent or knowledge.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious website that embeds the vulnerable Kibana UI within an iframe.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and host a webpage that embeds the Kibana UI in an iframe.
- The attacker also needs to lure the victim to this malicious page

**Additional details:**
- Upstream Kibana did not consider this a vulnerability.
- The fix is to add the `X-Frame-Options` header with a value of `deny` or `sameorigin`.
- Red Hat has addressed the issue in OpenShift Container Platform via errata RHSA-2020:3727 and RHSA-2020:4298.
