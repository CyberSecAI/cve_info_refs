This is a minor release with some bugfixes and small improvements

## New features

* Support device id in host device plugin ([#471](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pull/471)).
* win-bridge: add support for portMappings capability ([#475](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pull/475)).
* Make host-device to work with virtio net device ([#453](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pull/453)).

## Small improvements

* ptp, bridge: disable accept\_ra on the host-side interface ([#484](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pull/484)).
* modify the error url of windowscontainer ([#460](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pull/460)).
* portmap: Apply the DNAT hairpin to the whole subnet ([#469](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pull/469)). The DNAT hairpin rule only allow the container itself to access the ports it is exposing thru the host IP. Other containers in the same subnet might also want to access this service via the host IP, so apply this rule to the whole subnet instead of just for the container.
* Unlock OS thread after netns is restored ([#455](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pull/455)).

## Bugfixes

* plugins/meta/sbr: Adjusted ipv6 address mask to /128 ([#479](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pull/479)). A /64 mask was used which routed an entire cidr based on source, not only the bound address.
* check bridge's port state ([#468](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pull/468)). fix [#463](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/issues/463)
* Reset the route flag before moving the rule ([#472](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pull/472)).
* replace juju/errors because of CNCF license scan ([#458](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pull/458)). ref to [#457](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/issues/457)
* loopback: Fix ipv6 address checks ([#442](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/pull/442)). Fixes a minor bug in loopback plugin. The IPv6 address check loops over IPv4 addresses.

As always, thanks to all the contributors.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-10749 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10749)

#### Description

A vulnerability was found in all versions of containernetworking/plugins before version 0.8.6, that allows malicious containers in Kubernetes clusters to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. A malicious container can exploit this flaw by sending rogue IPv6 router advertisements to the host or other containers, to redirect traffic to the malicious container.

There are no "ipv6" rules, therefore no "ipv6" traffic is forwarded.  <http://www.openvswitch.org/support/dist-docs/ovs-fields.7.txt>   ```  [Comment 41](show_bug.cgi?id=1833220#c41)  Sam Fowler    2020-12-21 23:55:20 UTC  ``` Statement:  In OpenShift Container Platform 4, the default network plugin, OpenShift SDN, and OVN Kubernetes, do not forward IPv6 traffic, making this vulnerability not exploitable. The affected code from containernetworking/plugins is however still included in these plugins, hence this vulnerability is rated Low for both OpenShift SDN and OVN-Kubernetes.  IPv6 traffic is not forwarded by the OpenShift SDN in OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, making this vulnerability not exploitable. However, the affected code from containernetworking/plugins is still included in the atomic-openshift package, hence this vulnerability is rated Low for OpenShift Container Platform 3.11.   ```  [Comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=1833220#c42)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-02-24 15:09:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.7  Via RHSA-2020:5633 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:5633](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A5633)   ``` |  |

There are no "ipv6" rules, therefore no "ipv6" traffic is forwarded.  <http://www.openvswitch.org/support/dist-docs/ovs-fields.7.txt>   ```  [Comment 41](show_bug.cgi?id=1833220#c41)  Sam Fowler    2020-12-21 23:55:20 UTC  ``` Statement:  In OpenShift Container Platform 4, the default network plugin, OpenShift SDN, and OVN Kubernetes, do not forward IPv6 traffic, making this vulnerability not exploitable. The affected code from containernetworking/plugins is however still included in these plugins, hence this vulnerability is rated Low for both OpenShift SDN and OVN-Kubernetes.  IPv6 traffic is not forwarded by the OpenShift SDN in OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, making this vulnerability not exploitable. However, the affected code from containernetworking/plugins is still included in the atomic-openshift package, hence this vulnerability is rated Low for OpenShift Container Platform 3.11.   ```  [Comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=1833220#c42)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-02-24 15:09:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.7  Via RHSA-2020:5633 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:5633](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A5633)   ``` |  |
