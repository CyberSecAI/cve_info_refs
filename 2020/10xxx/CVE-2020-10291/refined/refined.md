{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Visual Components Network License Server, using RMS Sentinel licensing, binds to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) and listens for packets over UDP port 5093 without requiring any authentication/authorization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated access to the license server via UDP port 5093, leading to system information disclosure.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can retrieve sensitive system information, including hardware and OS characteristics, as well as license server version information, which could be leveraged for further attacks, such as launching local simulations with similar characteristics or pivoting to connected industrial machinery via PLC connectivity features.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based attacks targeting UDP port 5093 of the Visual Components Network License Server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable license server to send UDP packets to port 5093. No prior authentication is required."
