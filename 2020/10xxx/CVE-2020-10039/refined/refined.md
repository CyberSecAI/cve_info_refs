- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of encryption of sensitive data transmitted between a legitimate user and the web server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the absence of encryption for sensitive data in transit, making it vulnerable to interception and modification. This is described as "Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data".
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack can gain read and write access to the transmitted data. This implies they can both view and modify the data exchanged between the user and the web server. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or manipulation of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle attack. The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position between the legitimate user and the web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position between the legitimate user and the web server, enabling them to intercept and modify network traffic. User interaction is required as the attack requires the user to be actively using the web application.
