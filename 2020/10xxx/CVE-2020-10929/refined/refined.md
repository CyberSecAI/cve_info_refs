```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the handling of string table file uploads, leading to an integer overflow before buffer allocation.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Integer overflow",
     "Lack of input validation"
  ],
  "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows a network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the admin user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by uploading a crafted string table file. The attack is network-adjacent and does not require authentication.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the target device and does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability. They need to be able to send crafted string table file uploads."
