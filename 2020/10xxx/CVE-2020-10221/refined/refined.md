{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `ajaxAddTemplate.php` file, specifically within the `exec()` function. The `$fileName` variable, which is derived from user input via POST request, is incorporated into the command executed by `exec()`. Insufficient sanitization or validation of the user-supplied `$fileName` value allows for command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsanitized user input",
      "Command injection vulnerability",
      "Use of `exec()` function with user-controlled input"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server where the application is running. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, or denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to `/lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxAddTemplate.php`",
       "The `fileName` parameter in the POST request is used to inject a command"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Valid user credentials for the rConfig application",
      "Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the target application",
      "Basic understanding of command injection techniques"
    ],
    "more_details": "The vulnerability exists because the application does not properly sanitize or validate the `fileName` parameter when using the `exec()` function. An attacker can insert shell metacharacters (e.g., semicolons) within the `fileName` parameter to terminate the intended command and then execute arbitrary commands of their choosing on the server. The application attempts to append `.yml` to the `fileName` but this can be bypassed with another semicolon at the end of the injected command. The exploit uses a bash reverse shell to connect back to the attacker's machine."
