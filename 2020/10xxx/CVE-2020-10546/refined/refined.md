Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10546:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is an SQL injection in the `compliancepolicies.inc.php` file of rConfig. The `$searchColumn` parameter from the GET request is directly included in an SQL query without proper sanitization or the use of prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `$searchColumn` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable file (`compliancepolicies.inc.php`) can be accessed without authentication, making the SQL injection exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the rConfig database. The provided exploit code specifically targets the extraction of:
    *   Database name
    *   Device information (IP addresses, usernames, passwords, enable passwords).
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** By gaining access to the database, an attacker could potentially pivot to other attacks, such as gaining access to the network devices managed by rConfig. This is possible since rConfig stores credentials for network devices.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, leading to a data breach, and potentially expose credentials for the managed network infrastructure.
*   **Authentication bypass:** While not directly the vulnerability, the information disclosure could be used to gain access to the application which could lead to other vulnerabilities such as remote code execution

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `compliancepolicies.inc.php` file. The vulnerable parameter is `searchColumn`.
*   **URL Parameter Injection:**  The attacker manipulates the `searchColumn` parameter within the URL to inject SQL code. For example, `searchColumn=policyName&searchOption=contains&searchField=antani'+UNION+SELECT+...`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the rConfig server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have any user account on the rConfig application. The vulnerability can be exploited by any unauthenticated user on the network.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of crafting HTTP requests and SQL syntax to perform the SQL injection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a Python exploit script for CVE-2020-10546, confirming that this is a remote SQL injection and demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited in a real-world scenario.
*   The vulnerability affects rConfig versions prior to 3.9.7.
*   The blog post by "the guly" also mentions that the vulnerability was part of a larger security review that included a remote code execution, privilege escalation, and other vulnerabilities, which were later patched in versions 3.9.6 and 3.9.7 of rConfig.
* The script exploits the SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve database information, as well as device credentials. It uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract this data.
* The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-10220, which was reported by another researcher.

**In summary, CVE-2020-10546 is an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to extract sensitive information from the rConfig database including device credentials potentially compromising the managed network infrastructure.**
