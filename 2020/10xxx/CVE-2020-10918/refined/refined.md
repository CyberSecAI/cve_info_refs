Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists within the authentication mechanism of the C-MORE HMI EA9 touch screen panels.
*   Specifically, it's due to insufficient authentication on post-authentication requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Authentication bypass: The system fails to properly authenticate requests after the initial authentication, allowing attackers to bypass access controls.
*   Insufficient authentication: The core issue is the lack of adequate checks on post-authentication requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Privilege escalation: Successful exploitation allows attackers to escalate privileges to resources that are normally protected from unauthenticated users.
*   Potential unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources: The vulnerability allows attackers to access protected resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network-based: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Remote attacker: An attacker does not require physical access to the device and can exploit the vulnerability over the network.
*   No authentication required: The attacker doesn't need to have valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability, as the vulnerability lies in the handling of requests after authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 6.60 of the C-MORE HMI EA9 firmware.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-02-10, and the advisory was publicly released on 2020-07-07.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ta-Lun Yen & Chizuru Toyama of TXOne IoT/ICS Security Research Labs (Trend Micro).
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.5, with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
