Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `try_read_command_binary` function within `memcached.c`, specifically in the handling of the binary protocol header.
- The issue is a buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when copying the "extlen" data during binary protocol processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The code allocates a buffer `extbuf` of size `sizeof(c->binary_header) + BIN_MAX_EXTLEN`. It then copies `extlen` bytes into this buffer from `c->rcurr` without verifying if `extlen` exceeds `BIN_MAX_EXTLEN`.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `memcpy` operation at memcached.c line 6179 does not validate the length of `extlen` against the size of `extbuf`, allowing `memcpy` to write past the buffer boundary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can send a specially crafted binary protocol request with a large `extlen` value, triggering a buffer overflow and causing the `memcached` server to crash (segfault). This makes the service unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
- **Binary Protocol:** The attack vector uses the `memcached` binary protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the `memcached` server.
- **Crafted Packets:** The attacker must be able to send custom binary protocol requests to the server, specifically crafting a packet with a large `extlen` value in the binary header.
- **No Authentication Needed:** The vulnerability can be triggered anonymously; no authentication is needed.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in `memcached` version 1.6.0 and is present in version 1.6.1.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure the `extlen` value does not exceed `BIN_MAX_EXTLEN`. In the patch, the `memcpy` copies `extlen` or `BIN_MAX_EXTLEN`, whichever is smaller.
- The vulnerability was reported by "Icejl" who also provided a proof-of-concept (POC).
- The suggested workaround is to either update to `memcached` version 1.6.2 or disable the binary protocol if it's not needed by using `-B ascii` option.
