### Memcached 1.6.2 Release Notes

Date: 2020-3-23

### Download

<http://www.memcached.org/files/memcached-1.6.2.tar.gz>

### Overview

Fixes a remote DoS (segfault) in parsing of the binary protocol header that was
introduced in 1.6.0. Update immediately or disable the binary protocol if you
are not using it (`-B ascii`).

### Fixes

* No other fixes.

### New Features

* None.

### Contributors

The following people contributed to this release since 1.6.1.

Note that this is based on who contributed changes, not how they were
done. In many cases, a code snippet on the mailing list or a bug
report ended up as a commit with your name on it.

Note that this is just a summary of how many changes each person made
which doesn't necessarily reflect how significant each change was.
For details on what led up into a branch, either grab the git repo and
look at the output of `git log 1.6.1..1.6.2` or use a web view.

## Description

![@Icejl](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29170518?v=4&size=48)[Icejl](https://github.com/Icejl)opened [on Mar 23, 2020](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/issues/629#issue-586054883)

Hi, Memcached team,

Recently, I revealed a buffer overflow vulnerability which may cause DOS attack. The exploit details can be found as following.

### Affect Version

memcached-1.6.0

memcached-1.6.1

### Root cause

file location: memcached.c:6156-6187

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29170518/77297732-b15af580-6d24-11ea-8d4d-ca9befffeae5.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29170518/77297732-b15af580-6d24-11ea-8d4d-ca9befffeae5.png)

### Code Audit

```
6178   char extbuf[sizeof(c->binary_header) + BIN_MAX_EXTLEN];
6179   memcpy(extbuf + sizeof(c->binary_header), c->rcurr + sizeof(c->binary_header), **extlen**);
```

in line 6179, since there is no mechanism to verify the parameter's length, in this case, the length of "**extlen**" when calling memcpy function, It will cause buffer overflow if large value assigned to the **extlen** variable.

### POC

```
0x80 0x01 [0x00 0x00] keylen

[0x30] extlen 0x00 0x00 x00

```

for the POC snippet, first, if I assign a large value to the variable **extlen**, on the other hand, in order to bypass the validation of data packet which sent in following code snippet,

`6156 if (c->rbytes < keylen + extlen + sizeof(c->binary_header))`

we can construct a very large data packet and send it to the server running **memcached** 1.6.0 or 1.6.1 anonymously. After that, the program will crash because of the issue mentioned above.

Note: Please confirm this issue ASAP. Besides, just letting you know, I am gonna submit this issue to CVE mitre.

Please let me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Icejl
