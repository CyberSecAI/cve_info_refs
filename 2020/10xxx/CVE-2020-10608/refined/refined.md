Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10608:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper verification of cryptographic signatures when loading PI System libraries. This allows a local attacker to bypass code integrity checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature (CWE-347)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to privilege escalation, allowing a local attacker to target another local user of PI System software on the computer.
- This can result in unauthorized information disclosure, deletion, or modification of data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required. An attacker needs to have local access to the target machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to plant a malicious binary on the system.
- The attacker does not require elevated privileges initially, but can use the vulnerability to escalate them.
