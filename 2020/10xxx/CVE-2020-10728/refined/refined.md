Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-10728:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `automationbroker/apb` container image granted all users `sudoer` permissions. This was due to the inclusion of a permissive `sudoers` file in the Dockerfile and the use of `sudo` for adding users and groups during the image build process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Permissive sudoers configuration:**  The primary vulnerability is the overly permissive `sudoers` configuration, which allows any user within the container to execute commands as the root user without needing a password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Privilege escalation:** An attacker with access to a running container can leverage the `sudoer` permissions to escalate their privileges to root within the container.
-   **Data confidentiality and integrity:**  With root access, an attacker can potentially access sensitive data within the container, modify data, or disrupt the container's functionality.
-   **System availability:** A compromised container could lead to denial-of-service conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Compromised container:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to a running instance of the vulnerable `automationbroker/apb` container.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Access to the container:**  The attacker needs to have some form of access to the container's shell environment in order to execute commands. This could be through compromised applications within the container, or by other means of access to the containerâ€™s environment.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `automationbroker/apb` container versions up to and including 2.0.4-1.
- The issue was addressed by modifying the Dockerfile to remove the explicit `sudoers` configuration, and changing the script to avoid the use of `sudo` when adding users and groups in the image build process.
- By default, this vulnerability is not exploitable in unprivileged containers running on OpenShift Container Platform due to the default seccomp policy blocking `SETUID` and `SETGID` system calls.
- The `openshift-enterprise-abp-tools` container, which was present in OpenShift prior to version 4.4, was affected.
