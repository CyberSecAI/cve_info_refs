- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Malicious code can be introduced through the Ticket functionality within Zammad.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious JavaScript code will execute within the browser of any user who opens the ticket or has the ticket within the "Toolbar." This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities performed on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** A low-privileged user can inject malicious code through the Ticket functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have an account with low privileges and the ability to create or modify tickets within the Zammad system.
