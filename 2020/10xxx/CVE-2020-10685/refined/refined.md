{
  "cveId": "CVE-2020-10685",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Ansible handles temporary files when decrypting vault-encrypted files. Specifically, the temporary files containing decrypted data were being created in the `/tmp` directory and not properly cleaned up after use. ",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure Temporary File Handling",
        "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere"
      ],
      "impact": "The decrypted data, which could contain sensitive information, could remain on the system's disk after the Ansible task has completed. If `/tmp` is not a `tmpfs` mount, the data persists even after the system is powered off, leading to potential information disclosure.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Local Access: An attacker with local access to the machine could potentially read the decrypted data from the temporary files in `/tmp`.",
         "The vulnerability is triggered when Ansible modules decrypt vault files (e.g., assemble, script, unarchive, win_copy, aws_s3 or copy modules).",
         "An attacker with access to the affected host after the ansible playbook has executed may be able to find the decrypted files."
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the machine where Ansible is running.",
      "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability exists because Ansible was creating temporary files in the system's default temp directory (`/tmp`), instead of using a secure, per-process or per-task, temporary directory. The issue is exacerbated on systems where `/tmp` is not a `tmpfs` mount, as the temporary files are not automatically cleared."
