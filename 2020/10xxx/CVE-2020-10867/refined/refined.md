Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10867:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control within the `aswTask` RPC endpoint of the TaskEx library in the Avast Service (`AvastSvc.exe`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks on tasks invoked via the `aswTask` RPC endpoint. This allows untrusted processes to trigger actions that should be restricted.
- **RPC Endpoint Misconfiguration:** The RPC endpoint is not properly secured, which enables bypassing access restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Task Execution:** Attackers can perform unauthorized actions/tasks from an untrusted process.
- **Bypass of Intended Restrictions:** The vulnerability allows circumventing intended access restrictions, potentially leading to other security issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **RPC Calls:** Attackers exploit the vulnerable `aswTask` RPC endpoint.
- **Untrusted Processes:** The attack can be initiated from a low-integrity process, highlighting that the access control measures are insufficient.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** Attackers require local access to the machine running the vulnerable Avast software.
- **Ability to Interact with RPC Endpoint:** Attackers need the ability to interact with the Avast Service's RPC endpoint.
- **Low Integrity Process:** The vulnerability can be exploited from a low-integrity process, indicating no need for elevated privileges initially.

**Additional Notes:**

- The content specifies that the vulnerability is present in Avast Antivirus versions before 20.
- The provided GitHub repository provides further details on this vulnerability and several other related vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability exists when the Self Defense feature is enabled.
