- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of the certificate presented by the server during HTTPS file downloads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can compromise the integrity of downloaded information. This can be leveraged with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the vulnerability during the downloading of files via HTTPS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required.
