  "CVE-2020-10030": {
    "description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.0 up to and including 4.3.0. It allows an attacker (with enough privileges to change the system's hostname) to cause disclosure of uninitialized memory content via a stack-based out-of-bounds read. It only occurs on systems where gethostname() does not have '\\0' termination of the returned string if the hostname is larger than the supplied buffer. (Linux systems are not affected because the buffer is always large enough. OpenBSD systems are not affected because the returned hostname always has '\\0' termination.) Under some conditions, this issue can lead to the writing of one '\\0' byte out-of-bounds on the stack, causing a denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution.",
    "root_cause": "The `gethostname()` function may not null-terminate the returned string if the hostname is larger than the supplied buffer, leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds read in PowerDNS Recursor when processing the hostname.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based out-of-bounds read",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Disclosure of uninitialized memory, denial of service, and possibly arbitrary code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker with sufficient privileges to change the system's hostname can exploit the vulnerability. This could be through direct system access or privilege escalation.",
        "The vulnerability is triggered when `gethostname()` does not null-terminate the hostname string, which typically occurs when the hostname is larger than the allocated buffer."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs privileges to change the system's hostname. This might require root or administrator access or being able to compromise a process with those privileges. The attacker needs to control the system hostname, manipulating the content returned by gethostname, on a vulnerable system where gethostname() does not null terminate the string."

  "CVE-2020-12244": {
    "description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.0 through 4.3.0 where records in the answer section of a NXDOMAIN response lacking an SOA were not properly validated in SyncRes::processAnswer, allowing an attacker to bypass DNSSEC validation.",
      "root_cause": "The PowerDNS Recursor does not properly validate records in the answer section of a NXDOMAIN response when the response lacks an SOA record.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of DNS records",
      "Bypass of DNSSEC validation"
    ],
     "impact": "An attacker can bypass DNSSEC validation and potentially manipulate DNS resolution, redirecting users to malicious sites, or disrupting services.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can craft malicious DNS responses to bypass DNSSEC validation.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be in a position to inject or manipulate DNS responses to vulnerable PowerDNS Recursor instances. This typically involves a man-in-the-middle attack or control over an authoritative DNS server."

    "CVE-2020-10995": {
        "description": "PowerDNS Recursor from 4.1.0 up to and including 4.3.0 does not sufficiently defend against amplification attacks. An issue in the DNS protocol has been found that allow malicious parties to use recursive DNS services to attack third party authoritative name servers. The attack uses a crafted reply by an authoritative name server to amplify the resulting traffic between the recursive and other authoritative name servers. Both types of service can suffer degraded performance as an effect. This is triggered by random subdomains in the NSDNAME in NS records. PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.16, 4.2.2 and 4.3.1 contain a mitigation to limit the impact of this DNS protocol issue.",
        "root_cause": "The PowerDNS Recursor does not sufficiently defend against amplification attacks due to a flaw in how it handles crafted replies with random subdomains in the NSDNAME of NS records.",
         "weaknesses": [
             "Insufficient protection against DNS amplification attacks",
             "Vulnerability to crafted DNS responses"

         "impact": "Malicious parties can use recursive DNS services to attack third-party authoritative name servers, leading to degraded performance for both types of service.",
        "attack_vectors": "An attacker can use crafted DNS replies to trigger the amplification. The crafted replies contain random subdomains in the NSDNAME field of NS records.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control an authoritative DNS server that can send specially crafted DNS responses. They also need to be able to induce recursive DNS servers to query the controlled authoritative server, usually through a crafted client query that includes a subdomain."
