- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected Honeywell ControlEdge PLC and RTU devices transmit session tokens in cleartext over the network.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to obtain session tokens.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, as the tokens are transmitted in cleartext over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with network access to the affected devices can intercept the cleartext session tokens. The attacker does not require any prior authentication or user interaction.
