Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection. It occurs due to improper sanitization or validation of the `id` parameter within the `/sentrifugo/index.php/holidaygroups/add` resource.
*   **Weakness:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. Specifically, the 'id' parameter is vulnerable.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database. This includes potentially accessing user credentials, personal information, and other confidential data stored within the database.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is via a POST request to the `/sentrifugo/index.php/holidaygroups/add` endpoint. The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the POST request to inject SQL code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific authentication is required to exploit the SQLi vulnerability.
* **Additional Details:** The exploit uses a time-based blind SQL injection technique, specifically using `SLEEP()` function, to infer information from the database based on response delays. The attacker crafts a payload containing `0'XOR(if(now()=sysdate()%2Csleep(9)%2C0))XOR'Z`.
