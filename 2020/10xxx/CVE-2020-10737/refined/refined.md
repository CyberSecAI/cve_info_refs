Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-10737:

**Root Cause:**
- A race condition exists in the `oddjob_selinux_mkdir` function within the `mkhomedir` tool. This tool is responsible for creating home directories for new users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Symlink Attack:** During the home directory creation process, `mkhomedir` copies the contents of `/etc/skel` to the new home directory. It then changes the ownership of the newly created home directory to the new user. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the tool does not properly verify the path of the newly created home directory and any symlinks within it before changing ownership.
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition where an attacker can create a symbolic link within the target home directory, prior to the ownership change.
- **Inadequate Path Validation:** The `oddjob_selinux_mkdir` function does not validate or follow symbolic links and check user permissions when creating directories and changing ownership during home directory setup.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can create a symbolic link within the target user's home directory, pointing to a privileged directory (e.g. `/etc`). When `mkhomedir` changes the ownership of the home directory, it unintentionally changes the ownership of the target directory pointed to by the symlink to the unprivileged user. This allows the attacker to gain control over the ownership of the privileged directory and potentially escalate privileges or cause other damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to have a way to create a symbolic link in the target home directory during a small window of opportunity while the mkhomedir tool is copying /etc/skel and before the tool changes the directory permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have some level of access to the system where user accounts are being created. The attacker would need to race the `mkhomedir` process when a new user is being created.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this issue involves deferring the setting of permissions on newly created home directories until after the contents have been populated, thus mitigating the race condition and symlink attack.
- The vulnerability was reported by Matthias Gerstner of the SUSE security team and the fix was backported to address this issue.
- The vulnerability affects versions of oddjob prior to 0.34.5 and 0.34.6.
