The provided content is related to CVE-2020-10866.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the Avast Antivirus's `aswTask` RPC endpoint within the `TaskEx` library of the `AvastSvc.exe` service, which allows unprivileged processes to query sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure RPC Endpoint: The `aswTask` RPC endpoint does not properly restrict access, enabling low-integrity processes to call specific functions that should be restricted to higher privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Attackers can enumerate network interfaces and access points. This information may be used for further attacks or reconnaissance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- RPC: The vulnerability is exploited through RPC calls to the `aswTask` endpoint.
- Low Integrity Process: The attacker needs to execute code as a low-integrity process, which indicates that they may not need high-level privileges on the target machine initially.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the target system with low integrity.
- The attacker must be able to communicate with the AvastSvc RPC service.
