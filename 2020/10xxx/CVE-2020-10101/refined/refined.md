- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Zammad WebSocket server crashes when it receives messages that are not in JSON format. The server does not properly check the message format and does not handle parsing errors.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation, lack of error handling in the WebSocket server when processing non-JSON messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the Zammad WebSocket server to crash.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending non-JSON formatted messages to the Zammad WebSocket server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the WebSocket server.
