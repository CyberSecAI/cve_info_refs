Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10959:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of user-supplied content to manipulate the target URL of the logout button. This was possible due to the logout button's click handler being vulnerable to redirection via user controlled HTML elements with the id "pt-logout".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unprotected Logout Link:** The logout button's link was not sufficiently protected against modification by user-generated content.
*   **Click Hijacking:** User content could create a fake logout button and intercept the click event, leading to redirection to an arbitrary URL after logging out.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** There was no proper sanitization or validation of the logout button's URL, allowing user-provided URLs to be used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites after they clicked the logout button, potentially for phishing attacks, malware downloads, or other malicious activities.
*   **Clickjacking:** A user clicking the logout button would be redirected to the attacker's site, potentially leading to further compromise if the attacker is able to exploit any vulnerabilities there.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Content Injection:** Attackers could inject malicious HTML code into a wiki page, specifically targeting the logout button's ID (`pt-logout`).
*   **Manipulated Logout Link:** By injecting a div with the ID `pt-logout` that contains a link element, the attacker could control the target URL for the logout button.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Edit Wiki Pages:** The attacker needs to have the ability to edit or create pages on the MediaWiki instance, which allows them to inject the malicious HTML.
*  **Logged-in User:**  The attack requires a logged in user to be able to view and click the manipulated logout button.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves adding the `data-mw="interface"` attribute to the logout button and updating the JavaScript selector to only target elements with this attribute. This prevents user-generated content from hijacking the logout button functionality.
*   The vulnerability was introduced with the change that turned the logout link into a POST API call.
*   The patch consists of changes to `includes/skins/BaseTemplate.php`, `includes/skins/SkinTemplate.php` and `resources/src/mediawiki.page.ready/ready.js`.
