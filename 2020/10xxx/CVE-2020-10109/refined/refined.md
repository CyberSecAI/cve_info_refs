Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-10109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Twisted Web handles HTTP requests when both a `Content-Length` header and a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header are present. According to HTTP specifications, `Transfer-Encoding` should take precedence, but Twisted Web incorrectly prioritizes `Content-Length`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTTP Request Smuggling:** The primary weakness is the improper handling of the `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers. This leads to an HTTP request smuggling vulnerability, where an attacker can embed a second HTTP request within the body of the first.
- **Header Handling:** Twisted Web does not correctly follow RFC 7230 guidelines related to how to process Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers in the same request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **HTTP Request Splitting/Smuggling:** An attacker can inject a secondary HTTP request which is treated as a separate request by the vulnerable server, this can lead to cache poisoning, session hijacking via socket poisoning, and security filter bypasses. The impact can vary based on how Twisted is deployed and the infrastructure it's part of.
- **Data exfiltration:** It can expose authorization headers and cookies when following cross-origin redirects (this is also related to CVE-2022-21712)

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over HTTP, allowing attackers to send crafted requests.
- **Pipelined Requests:** The vulnerability allows attackers to send pipelined requests by exploiting the server's incorrect parsing of the headers and content length.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server running a vulnerable version of Twisted.
- **Crafted HTTP Requests:** Attackers need to craft specific HTTP requests that contain both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` headers, exploiting the parsing vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- When both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` are present, Twisted Web incorrectly uses the value provided in the Content-Length header for request processing and interprets the remainder of the request body as a pipelined request.
- The issue can be triggered using a single TCP connection, by sending a crafted HTTP request and then smuggling a second request, by manipulating the `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Twisted version 20.3.0 or later, where the vulnerability is fixed by correctly prioritizing the `Transfer-Encoding` header over `Content-Length`.
- When Twisted is used as backend, use separate network connections from front-end components.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability exists in the `twisted.web` component of the Twisted framework.
- The vulnerability is not present in the core twisted packages, only in the web component.
- The vulnerability can be present both in a backend or frontend server, if they use the twisted web component.
- The vulnerability is often related with the presence of proxies, firewalls or other components that correctly process HTTP requests, since the vulnerability is in the request parsing of the twisted web component.
