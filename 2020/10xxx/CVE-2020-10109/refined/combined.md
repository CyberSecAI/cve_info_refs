## Details

it was discovered that Twisted incorrectly validated or sanitized certain

URIs or HTTP methods. A remote attacker could use this issue to inject

invalid characters and possibly perform header injection attacks.

([CVE-2019-12387](/security/CVE-2019-12387))

It was discovered that Twisted incorrectly verified XMPP TLS certificates.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack and obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-12855](/security/CVE-2019-12855))

It was discovered that Twisted incorrectly handled HTTP/2 connections. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Twisted to hang or

consume resources, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 19.10. ([CVE-2019-9512](/security/CVE-2019-9512), [CVE-2019-9514](/security/CVE-2019-9514),

[CVE-2019-9515](/security/CVE-2019-9515))

Jake Miller and ZeddYu Lu discovered that Twisted incorrectly handled

certain content-length headers. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to perform HTTP request splitting attacks. ([CVE-2020-10108](/security/CVE-2020-10108),

[CVE-2020-10109](/security/CVE-2020-10109))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1813439#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-03-13 19:57:29 UTC  ``` In Twisted Web through 19.10.0, there was an HTTP request splitting vulnerability. When presented with two content-length headers, it ignored the first header. When the second content-length value was set to zero, the request body was interpreted as a pipelined request.  Reference: <https://know.bishopfox.com/advisories/twisted-version-19.10.0>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1813439#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-03-13 19:58:00 UTC  ``` Created python-twisted tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-8 [[bug 1813442](show_bug.cgi?id=1813442 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-10108 python-twisted: HTTP request smuggling when presented with two Content-Length headers [epel-8]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1813441](show_bug.cgi?id=1813441 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-10108 python-twisted: HTTP request splitting when presented with two content-length headers [fedora-all]")] Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1813440](show_bug.cgi?id=1813440 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2020-10108 python-twisted: HTTP request smuggling when presented with two Content-Length headers [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1813439#c2)  Summer Long    2020-03-24 04:50:09 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/twisted-20.3.0/NEWS.rst>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1813439#c3)  Summer Long    2020-03-24 04:55:37 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <https://github.com/twisted/twisted/commit/4a7d22e490bb8ff836892cc99a1f54b85ccb0281>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1813439#c6)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-30 14:41:36 UTC  ``` Removed rhel-6/python-twisted-core and rhel-7/python-twisted-core entries from the affect list because those packages do not contain the vulnerable code. The vulnerability is in the web part of the twisted framework.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1813439#c8)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-30 15:21:52 UTC  ``` Function headerReceived() in http.py does not check whether a previous Content-Length header was already parsed, so when an attacker specifies two times the Content-Length, only the last one would be considered. However this is not the right behaviour according to RFC7230, so it can result in an HTTP request smuggling attack in case a proxy/firewall or another not-vulnerable component is placed before/after twisted.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1813439#c10)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-31 15:10:31 UTC  ``` Impact of the flaw set to Important as nowadays it is considered common practice to have a proxy/load-balancer before a web service, so HTTP requests smuggling attacks are more relevant. That said, the kind of impact these flaws can do can vary a lot based on the application, the infrastructure and the configuration.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1813439#c11)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-31 15:16:21 UTC  ``` Twisted can be used both as a back-end and as a front-end (e.g. proxy) and this flaw affects both settings.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1813439#c12)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-31 15:19:58 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  When python-twisted-web is used as the back-end of your infrastructure, you can partially mitigate the problem by ensuring that each request on the front-end component (e.g. proxy) is sent over a separate network connection to the python-twisted-web server. This will prevent interference between different users, but it will not prevent all possible attacks that can be performed, which would vary based on the infrastructure and application in use.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1813439#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-23 14:12:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2020:1561 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1561](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1561)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1813439#c25)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-04-23 16:31:46 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-10108>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1813439#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-29 09:45:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2020:1962 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1962](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1962)   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1813439#c27)  Summer Long    2020-12-18 01:47:13 UTC  ``` Statement:  OpenShift Container Platform 4.3 and later includes `python-twisted` as a dependency of `python-prometheus_client` in Ironic container images, however the affected code is not used.  Red Hat OpenStack Platform packages the flawed code, however python-twisted's web.HTTP functionality is not used in the RHOSP environment. For this reason, the RHOSP impact has been lowered to moderate and no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-twisted package.  Red Hat Satellite uses affected versions of `python-twisted` and  `python-twisted-web` modules in Pulp, however, it is not vulnerable since `http` modal of web implementation is not expose in product. Red Hat Satellite may update `python-twisted` and `python-twisted-web` in future.  This issue affects the version of python-twisted(embedded in calamari-server) shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 2. However, calamari is no longer supported, hence the embedded python-twisted package will not be fixed.   ``` |  |

# Twisted Version 19.10.0

By:
[Jake Miller, Security Researcher](https://bishopfox.com/authors/jake-miller)

![Gauge showing high severity reading](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Images/channels/blog/featured-images/High-Risk-Advisory-Featured.jpg)

## ADVISORY SUMMARY

The following document describes identified vulnerabilities in the Twisted application version 19.10.0.

## Impact

Request smuggling vulnerabilities are often high-risk and can lead to a variety of outcomes, including cache poisoning, session hijacking via socket poisoning, and security filter bypasses. By exploiting inconsistencies in HTTP message parsing, attackers can smuggle complete or partial secondary HTTP messages to a remote server to attack backend services or other users.

In this case, risk is highly contextual, it depends where and why Twisted is deployed in a given environment. The impact will vary depending on the business purpose of the service designed with Twisted.

For more information on the impact of HTTP request splitting vulnerabilities, please refer to the following:

* <https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling>
* <https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn>

## Risk Level

2. Contact with vendor: 12/09/2019
3. Vendor acknowledged vulnerabilities: 12/09/2019
4. Touch-base regarding disclosure; vendor optimistic of 3/9 patch deadline: 02/24/2020
5. Following up on patch status: 03/03/2020
6. Shared assigned CVE IDs with Twisted team: 03/04/2020
7. Coordinated full-disclosure/release timeline: 3/06/2020
8. Vendor released patched version 20.3.0rc1: 3/09/2020
9. Vulnerabilities publicly disclosed: 03/11/2020

This vulnerability is described in the following sections.

## VULNERABILITY

### HTTP REQUEST SPLITTING

Two HTTP request splitting (AKA HTTP request smuggling) vulnerabilities were identified in the latest version of Twisted Web. Both issues arose from deviations from RFC 7230 (HTTP/1.1: Message Syntax and Routing). Request smuggling vulnerabilities are often high-risk and can lead to a variety of outcomes, including cache poisoning, session hijacking via socket poisoning, and security filter bypasses.

To demonstrate the vulnerabilities, `printf` and `netcat` command examples are provided to construct raw HTTP messages as the client. For the server, I started Twisted Web 19.10.0 using `twistd web --path . --port tcp:` (Twisted Framework Python apps that use `twistd.web` are also affected).

| **CVE ID** | **Security Risk** | **Impact** | **Access Vector** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2020-10108](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-10108) | High | HTTP Request Splitting | Remote, Other |

### Instance #1

#### Double Content-Length Headers

When presented with two content-length headers, Twisted Web ignored the first header. When the second content-length was set to zero, it caused Twisted Web to interpret the request body as a pipelined request.

According to [RFC 7230 Section 3.3.3#4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3), if a message is received with multiple content-length headers with differing value, then the server must reject the message with a 400 response.

### **Request**

```
printf 'GET /doesnotexist HTTP/1.1\r\n'\
'Content-Length: 56\r\n'\
'Content-Length: 0\r\n'\
'Host: test.example.com\r\n'\
'\r\n'\
'GET /?opfdii=k58inf HTTP/1.1\r\n'\
'Host: test.example.com\r\n'\
'\r\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 <port
```
### **Response**

```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Server: TwistedWeb/19.10.0
Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2019 17:02:45 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

Hello
```

As shown above, both the `/doesnotexist` and the smuggled request to the base path `[/]` were successfully resolved.

| **CVE ID** | **Security Risk** | **Impact** | **Access Vector** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Instance #2

#### Differing Content-Length/Chunked Encoding

When presented with a content-length and a chunked encoding header, the content-length took precedence and the remainder of the request body was interpreted by Twisted Web as a pipelined request.

According to [RFC 7230 Section 3.3.3#3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3), if a message with both content-length and chunked encoding is accepted, transfer-encoding overrides the content-length.

### **Request**

```
printf 'GET /?nkomd7=8h7pjm HTTP/1.1\r\n'\
'Transfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n'\
'Content-Length: 4\r\n'\
'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n'\
'Host: test.example.com\r\n'\
'\r\n'\
'33\r\n'\
'GET /?ab8c4i=deg3if HTTP/1.1\r\n'\
'Content-Length: 5\r\n'\
'Host: test.example.com\r\n'\
'\r\n'\
'\r\n'\
'0\r\n'\
'\r\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 <port>
```
### **Response**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: TwistedWeb/19.10.0
Date: Mon, 09 Dec 2019 17:04:19 GMT
Accept-Ranges: bytes

As shown above, smuggled requests were interpreted by the Twisted server. The impact of these vulnerabilities can vary depending on the surrounding infrastructure and the purpose of the service implemented with Twisted.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1813447#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-03-13 20:02:33 UTC  ``` In Twisted Web through 19.10.0, there was an HTTP request splitting vulnerability. When presented with a content-length and a chunked encoding header, the content-length took precedence and the remainder of the request body was interpreted as a pipelined request.

The vulnerability is in the web part of the twisted framework.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1813447#c8)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-30 15:18:56 UTC  ``` rhel-6/python-twisted-web is not affected by this flaw because the logic in function headerReceived() is a bit different from the vulnerable version, so even if both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding are specified, the Transfer-Encoding one will have precedence over the Content-Length.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1813447#c10)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-31 15:12:28 UTC  ``` Impact of the flaw set to Important as nowadays it is considered common practice to have a proxy/load-balancer before a web service, so HTTP requests smuggling attacks are more relevant. That said, the kind of impact these flaws can do can vary a lot based on the application, the infrastructure and the configuration.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1813447#c11)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-31 15:16:24 UTC  ``` Twisted can be used both as a back-end and as a front-end (e.g. proxy) and this flaw affects both settings.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1813447#c12)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-31 15:20:03 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  When python-twisted-web is used as the back-end of your infrastructure, you can partially mitigate the problem by ensuring that each request on the front-end component (e.g. proxy) is sent over a separate network connection to the python-twisted-web server. This will prevent interference between different users, but it will not prevent all possible attacks that can be performed, which would vary based on the infrastructure and application in use.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1813447#c14)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-03-31 15:29:29 UTC  ``` First upstream version to introduce this issue is twisted-9.0.0.

Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-10109>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1813447#c24)  Summer Long    2021-01-14 05:29:38 UTC  ``` Statement:  Although Red Hat OpenStack Platform packages the flawed code, python-twisted's web.HTTP functionality is not used in the RHOSP environment.  For this reason, the RHOSP impact has been lowered to moderate and no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-twisted package .  OpenShift Container Platform 4.3 and later includes `python-twisted` as a dependency of `python-prometheus_client` in Ironic container images, however the affected code is not used.  Red Hat Satellite uses affected versions of `python-twisted` and  `python-twisted-web` modules in Pulp, however, it is not vulnerable since `http` modal of web implementation is not expose in product. Red Hat Satellite may update `python-twisted` and `python-twisted-web` in future.  This issue affects the version of python-twisted(embedded in calamari-server) shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 2. However, calamari is no longer supported, hence the embedded python-twisted package will not be fixed.   ``` |  |

Package        : twisted
Version        : 16.6.0-2+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-10108 CVE-2020-10109 CVE-2022-21712
Debian Bug     : 953950

It was discovered that Twisted, a Python event-based framework for
internet applications, is affected by HTTP request splitting
vulnerabilities, and may expose sensitive data when following
redirects. An attacker may bypass validation checks and retrieve
credentials.

CVE-2020-10108

    HTTP request splitting vulnerability. When presented with two
    content-length headers, it ignored the first header. When the
    second content-length value was set to zero, the request body was
    interpreted as a pipelined request.

CVE-2020-10109

    HTTP request splitting vulnerability. When presented with a
    content-length and a chunked encoding header, the content-length
    took precedence and the remainder of the request body was
    interpreted as a pipelined request.

CVE-2022-21712

    Twisted exposes cookies and authorization headers when following
    cross-origin redirects. This issue is present in the
    `twisted.web.RedirectAgent` and
    `twisted.web.BrowserLikeRedirectAgent` functions.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
16.6.0-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your twisted packages.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
