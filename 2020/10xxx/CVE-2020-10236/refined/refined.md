Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Froxlor installer was using static and predictable filenames in the `/tmp` directory for temporary files. Specifically, it was using `/tmp/userdata.inc.php` and `/tmp/froxlor_backup_[date].sql`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Predictable Filenames:** The use of static or predictable names for temporary files in a shared directory like `/tmp` makes it easier for an attacker to predict the file path and interact with them.
*   **Insecure File Handling:** The installer created files in `/tmp` with specific permissions (e.g., 0440 for `userdata.inc.php`) and potentially manipulated the data within these files, without sufficient protection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Local users could potentially create or modify these files to cause a denial of service.
*   **Data Corruption:** Local users could potentially corrupt configuration or data files owned by the web server user.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local access:** An attacker would need local access to the server to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be a local user on the system where Froxlor is installed.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by using `tempnam()` to generate unpredictable temporary file names.
* The fix was implemented in commit `6b09720ef8a1cc008751dd0ca0140a0597fedce5`
* The vulnerability is present in froxlor before version 0.10.14.
