SSA-305120: Vulnerabilities in SICAM MMU, SICAM T and SICAM
SGU

SUMMARY

SICAM MMU, SICAM T and the discontinued SICAM SGU devices are affected by multiple security
vulnerabilities which could allow an attacker to perform a variety of attacks. This may include unauthen-
ticated ﬁrmware installation, remote code execution and leakage of conﬁdential data like passwords.
Siemens has released updates to introduce authentication to the web application. It is still recommended
to implement further mitigations, as most of the vulnerabilities might not be sufﬁciently mitigated by this.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

SICAM MMU:
All versions < V2.05

SICAM SGU:
All versions

SICAM T:
All versions < V2.18

Update to V2.05 to introduce authentication in the
web application to mitigate some web application
issues.

ps/7KG9663-1AA00-1AA0

For RTU applications, Siemens recommends to
upgrade the discontinued SICAM SGU devices to
SICAM A8000 RTUs.

Update to V2.18 to introduce authentication in the
web application to mitigate some web application
issues.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• The ﬁrmware updates to SICAM T and SICAM MMU introduce authentication to the web application
and remove some unnecessary functionality. The web authentication functionality reduces the risk
of access to the device’s web application for executing administrative commands by unauthenticated
users.

• Due to hardware constraints, encryption is not possible on the devices. Conﬁdential data such as
passwords handled by the devices need to be protected on the network by other means, e.g. by
VPN.

• The risk for remote code execution and unauthenticated ﬁrmware installation can be mitigated by

ensuring encryption and authentication between the user and the device, e.g. by VPN.

• Using a modern and up to date browser while accessing the web application might reduce the risk

of Cross-Site-Scripting attacks.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SICAM T is a digital measurement transducer that allows the measuring of electrical quantities in
electrical networks in a single unit. In industries, power plants and substations, transducers are especially
used for measurand (e.g. current, voltage, power, phase angle, energy or frequency) assignment into
further processing through analog outputs or communication interface for precise control, notiﬁcation or
visualization tasks.

SICAM MMU (Measurement and Monitoring Unit) is a power monitoring device that allows the measuring
of electrical quantities in electrical networks in a single unit. In industries, power plants and substations,
the SICAM MMU is applied to measure and calculate parameters (e.g.current, voltage, power, phase
angle, harmonics and unbalance, energy or frequency) and assign them into further processing and
visualization to control center (SCADA, DMS, EMS etc) through IEC 60870-5-104 or automation system
over MODBUS TCP Protocols.

SICAM SGU (discontinued) was a smart grid remote terminal unit with communication capabilities for
electric utilities and public utility companies. It was intended to be used in particular as an input and
output unit for distributed power generation plants and consumers. Distributed energy resources could be
controlled and monitored by control centers (CC) or Decentralized Energy Management Systems (DEMS)
via the communication interfaces.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
