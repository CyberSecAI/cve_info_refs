Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10989:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the insufficient data validation and sanitization of the "Wifi Name" parameter within the Tenda AC15 AC1900 router's web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the "Wifi Name" field. This injected code is then executed in the victim's browser when they access the dashboard or any page where the WiFi name is displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Persistent XSS:** The injected JavaScript payload becomes persistent, meaning it will be executed every time an authenticated user views the vulnerable page.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By combining this XSS vulnerability with the CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2020-10986), an attacker can create a persistent denial of service condition by triggering the router reboot repeatedly. While a DoS is mentioned, the content primarily focuses on XSS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability through the router's web interface by injecting a malicious JavaScript payload into the "Wifi Name" field.
*   **Victim Interaction:**  The attack requires an authenticated user to access the web interface, which then executes the malicious JavaScript in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to inject the payload. It only requires an authenticated victim to visit the page where the vulnerable field is displayed, which triggers the XSS.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content details several other vulnerabilities in the Tenda AC15 AC1900 router, including a CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2020-10986), hardcoded credentials (CVE-2020-10988), and remote code execution vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-10987 & CVE-2020-15916).
*   The research indicates that Tenda had not patched these vulnerabilities at the time of publication.
*   The content provides a more detailed explanation of the XSS vulnerability (CVE-2020-10989) than the generic placeholder description from the CVE.
