Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-10514

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from the ability of an attacker to modify parameters of RPC (Remote Procedure Call) functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Command Injection:** By manipulating RPC parameters, an attacker can inject and execute malicious commands on the vulnerable device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device.
*   **DDoS Attacks:** The attacker can control the infected device and use it to perform Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **RPC Function Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the ability to modify parameters passed to RPC functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Password Possession:** The attacker needs to have the password for the device.
*   **Network Access** Although not explicitly stated, the attacker must have some level of network access to reach the vulnerable device.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is present in DVR (Digital Video Recorder) firmware.
*   The affected firmware versions are those released before 2020/02.
*   The device does not enforce password changes, which increases the risk as many devices may use default passwords.
*   More than 10 million devices are estimated to be affected in Taiwan.
* The vendor has released patches, and users are advised to contact the vendor for patching and updating.
