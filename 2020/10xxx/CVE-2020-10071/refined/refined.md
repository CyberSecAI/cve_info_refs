Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-10071:

**Summary:** The vulnerability lies in the Zephyr Project's MQTT implementation, specifically related to how it handles the length field of PUBLISH messages. Insufficient validation of this length can lead to a buffer overflow.

**Root Cause:**
- The MQTT parsing code in Zephyr doesn't adequately check the length of PUBLISH messages against the available buffer size before processing the data.
- Specifically, the code calculates the variable header length and compares it against the total message length but doesn't validate if the total length is sufficient.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** Lack of proper validation on the PUBLISH message length field.
- **Buffer Overflow:**  The insufficient validation can lead to a buffer overflow if the provided length is larger than the allocated buffer space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (Potential):** A buffer overflow in the MQTT handling code can potentially allow an attacker to overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A buffer overflow can also cause the device to crash, leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** An attacker can send a specially crafted MQTT PUBLISH message with a malformed length field to a vulnerable Zephyr device.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The attacker doesn't need physical access to the device, but rather can exploit it remotely through the network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send MQTT packets to the vulnerable Zephyr device.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the MQTT protocol structure to craft the malicious PUBLISH message.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content indicates that this vulnerability was addressed by commit `989c4713ba429aa5105fe476b4d629718f3e6082` which included the fix to properly validate the PUBLISH message length field.
- The vulnerability is referenced as NCC-ZEP-031, which is also mentioned in the provided text and refers to an NCC Group security assessment report.
- The fix is included in Zephyr v2.3.0.
