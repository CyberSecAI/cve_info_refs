Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-10111:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Citrix Gateway's inconsistent interpretation of HTTP requests, specifically when invalid or unspecified HTTP protocol versions (HTTP/1.2 to HTTP/1.9) are used in requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (CWE-444):** The Citrix Gateway's caching system does not properly handle requests with non-standard HTTP versions.
  - **Cache Bypass:** The caching mechanism can be bypassed by using requests with HTTP versions such as HTTP/1.2 up to HTTP/1.9.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Cache Poisoning:** While the provided text doesn't explicitly state "cache poisoning" as the impact of using the vulnerable HTTP versions, the text describes that using the vulnerable HTTP versions bypasses a poisoned cache and returns the correct value instead of the poisoned value. This indicates that the vulnerability can also be used to bypass a previously poisoned cache.
  - **Bypassing intended caching behavior:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to bypassing the intended caching behavior of the Citrix Gateway. This may reveal sensitive data or cause unexpected behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **Crafted HTTP Requests:** Attackers can send specially crafted HTTP requests with invalid/non-standard HTTP versions.
  - The vulnerability exists in the handling of HTTP requests to the Citrix Gateway.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Citrix Gateway.
  - **Ability to modify HTTP headers:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests, specifically modifying the HTTP protocol version in the request header (e.g., changing it from `HTTP/1.1` to `HTTP/1.2`).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found in Citrix Gateway versions 11.1, 12.0, and 12.1.
- Citrix did not consider the behavior as a vulnerability.
- A proof of concept is provided demonstrating the bypass of cached content by using an invalid HTTP version.
