Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-10753:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of newline characters within the `ExposeHeader` tag of the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration file in Ceph's RadosGW (Object Gateway). Specifically, the presence of a newline character (`\n` or `\r`) in the `ExposeHeader` value leads to HTTP header injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTTP Header Injection:** By injecting newline characters, an attacker can insert arbitrary HTTP headers into the server's response. This is possible due to insufficient sanitization or validation of the ExposeHeader tag's content.
*   **CORS Misconfiguration:** The root cause is also a misconfiguration or a lack of awareness of the implications of using user-controlled data in the `ExposeHeader` tag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Header Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious HTTP headers, potentially leading to various attacks.
*   **`Set-Cookie` Injection:**  Specifically mentioned in the Red Hat Bugzilla description, the attacker can use this to inject the `Set-Cookie` header and therefore set arbitrary cookies in the victim's browser.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Although not directly stated in the CVE description, header injection can be used to facilitate XSS by setting headers such as `Content-Type` or similar.
*   **Other Potential Impacts**: Other headers can be injected leading to cache poisoning or other malicious actions depending on the specific injected header and the application's behaviour.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CORS Configuration:** The primary attack vector is through a manipulated CORS configuration file where the `ExposeHeader` tag includes newline characters.
*   **S3 API (RadosGW):** The vulnerability specifically affects the RadosGW S3 API.
*   **Publicly Accessible S3 Bucket:** A malicious user could create a publicly accessible S3 bucket with a crafted CORS configuration to trigger the vulnerability when other users access the bucket.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *  The attacker needs to be able to create or modify the CORS configuration of an S3 bucket, which implies having some level of access to the Ceph environment.
    *  The attacker may also be an unauthenticated user that can create a publicly accessible S3 bucket with the malicious CORS configuration.
    *  The user interaction is required for the impact to be triggered, since a victim needs to access the manipulated bucket.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Ceph versions 3.x and 4.x are mentioned to be vulnerable. Specific fixed versions are also mentioned in the provided content.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix for this vulnerability involves sanitizing newlines within the `ExposeHeader` tag, typically by removing or encoding them.
*   **Severity:**  The severity is generally rated as "medium" or "moderate,"
*   **CVSS Metrics:** The CVSS v3 score is consistently given as 5.4 across the provided content.
*   **Multiple Products Affected:** The bug affects several products using Ceph, including various SUSE, Red Hat, and Ubuntu distributions and their related storage and cloud offerings.

In summary, CVE-2020-10753 describes a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers by manipulating the CORS configuration of Ceph's RadosGW. This can lead to a range of attacks. The patch requires proper sanitization of newline characters and is available in the provided updates.
