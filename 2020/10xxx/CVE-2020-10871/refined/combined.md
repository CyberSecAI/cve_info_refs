# luci-base: menu and i18n plays very BADLY with sysauth=false in master #3563

## Description

![@hmh](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23163?u=3904f6ebaa5ec0e6f55dbc86ab5e5b8cb64aeaa6&v=4&size=48)[hmh](https://github.com/hmh)opened [on Jan 25, 2020](https://github.com/openwrt/luci/issues/3563#issue-555144202)

LuCI pages with sysauth=false (e.g. status pages that should work even for an user that is not logged in) are broken on LuCI master.

The symptom is that when you access the page with "sysauth=false" attribute, the menu disappears, as in: not even nodes that are also sysauth=false show up.

What should happen: the menu should list all pages, always, and require authentication if you try to access one of them while lacking the required credentials.

Translations are also broken, and doubly so:

1. They try to XHR something from a node that is below /admin/, even if you are on a node on an entirely different subtree (like say, a /status node that should work unauthenticated and be the first page the user gets when he connects to the modem).
2. Whatever the translation stuff tries to fetch is hiding behind a sysauth=true node, which renders it useless for any sysauth=false page [if the user is unauthenticated]

Maybe the /l10n/ or /i18n/ namespace (or even wherever luci-static ends up) should be used for anything the i18n mechanism needs? It really doesn't make sense to have it tied to /admin/.

On commit r11655-a283b1788a the topmenu "

" is shown while no user logged in.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5218298/74883188-b2d57e80-5370-11ea-9e09-ef416931fdb6.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5218298/74883188-b2d57e80-5370-11ea-9e09-ef416931fdb6.png)

Any idea how to solve this issue?

Thank you.

Recent openwrt builds show the administration menu to unauthenticated guests: an attacker would be able to know the presence of installed packages and services on the box.
