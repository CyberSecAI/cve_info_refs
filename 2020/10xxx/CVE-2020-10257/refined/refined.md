- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ThemeREX Addons plugin registered a REST-API endpoint (`/trx_addons/v2/get/sc_layout`) without proper access controls or nonce checks. The endpoint allowed execution of arbitrary PHP functions due to the use of `function_exists($sc)` with unsanitized user input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Insecure REST API Endpoint**: The `/trx_addons/v2/get/sc_layout` endpoint was accessible to unauthenticated users, lacking capability checks or nonce verification for CSRF protection.
    - **Arbitrary PHP function execution**: The plugin used user-provided input to call PHP functions via `function_exists($sc)` without input sanitization. This allowed attackers to execute any available PHP function.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: Attackers could execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
    - **Privilege Escalation**: By executing functions like `wp_insert_user`, attackers could create new administrative accounts, gaining full control of the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **HTTP GET/POST requests**: Attackers sent malicious requests to the vulnerable REST API endpoint `example.com/wp-json/trx_addons/v2/get/sc_layout` with specific parameters to execute arbitrary PHP functions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **No authentication needed**: Attackers did not need any prior access or user credentials.
    - **Network access**: Attackers only needed network access to send requests to the WordPress site's REST API endpoint.
