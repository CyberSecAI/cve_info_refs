## Description

![@jpadilla](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83319?v=4&size=48)[jpadilla](https://github.com/jpadilla)opened [on Jul 8, 2019](https://github.com/jpadilla/django-rest-framework-jwt/issues/484#issue-465192457)

Hello there,

For a long time now I've honestly thought I'd have the time and energy to come back and work on this project, and I think I still don't. I've not worked on any project recently needing it, which makes it harder to find time to come back.

At some point I also noticed I no longer liked how the project had evolved and that it deserved a fair redesign and there are a few fundamental changes required. Now I'm certain that I wouldn't be able to work on this with the care required for a major version bump.

I'm definitely not proud at how long it has taken me to make this or any update, I recognize that and I'm sorry for not having spoken out sooner.

There's two efforts/projects that I'd like to point out to:

Fork: <https://github.com/Styria-Digital/django-rest-framework-jwt>

Drop-in updated replacement fork. I'm willing to transfer repo, pypi, etc, to keep this going.

Alternative: <https://github.com/davesque/django-rest-framework-simplejwt>

Many of the changes that I've wanted to work on are already done here. This is what I would probably use today.

Learned quite a few things from this. Thanks to everyone, including past collaborators and contributors. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Update:

I've transferred the repository from [@getblimp](https://github.com/getblimp). Neither [@getblimp](https://github.com/getblimp) nor [@gcollazo](https://github.com/gcollazo) are involved with this project anymore.

If you configure an app to allow blacklisting tokens and turn `JWT_ALLOW_REFRESH` on, then you can still operate the refresh endpoint using a blacklisted token, which allows you to side-step the fact that the token is invalidated.
