Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-10594:

**Content Analysis:**

The provided content includes two GitHub issue pages related to `django-rest-framework-jwt` and a non-functional pypi.org page.  The second GitHub page regarding issue #36 in the Styria-Digital fork directly relates to a security vulnerability.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from the fact that blacklisted tokens can still be used to obtain a new token via the refresh endpoint, effectively bypassing the blacklisting mechanism.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core issue is a logic flaw in the token refresh process. It doesn't properly check if a token is blacklisted before issuing a new one. This violates the intended purpose of token blacklisting which is to revoke access.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who has obtained a blacklisted token (e.g., after a user logs out or a token is explicitly invalidated) can still obtain a new, valid token and maintain access. This compromises the security of the system, potentially leading to unauthorized access.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is the `/refresh` endpoint of the API. An attacker needs a blacklisted JWT. 
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to obtain a blacklisted token. This could occur through legitimate user logout or explicit revocation action. The attacker then needs to use the token via a refresh request to the API.

**Summary:**
The content directly relates to a security vulnerability (CVE-2020-10594 according to its description) where a blacklisted token can be used to refresh and gain new valid tokens, thus bypassing the intended revocation mechanism.
