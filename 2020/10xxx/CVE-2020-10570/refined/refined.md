Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-10570:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a conflict between the Telegram application's passcode feature and its popup notification feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The Telegram application for Android (version 5.12 and earlier) fails to properly restrict access to messages when the "Show Popup" notification setting is enabled. This setting allows message content to be displayed in a popup notification, even when the app is locked with a passcode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Passcode Bypass:** A physically proximate attacker can bypass the passcode lock intended to protect user privacy by exploiting the popup notification feature.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can read message content displayed in the popup notifications without unlocking the app.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** The attacker may be able to reply to messages directly from the popup notification, again without unlocking the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Proximity:** The attacker needs to be physically close to the victim's device.
*   **Popup Notification Enabled:** The "Show Popup" setting must be enabled in the Telegram application on the target device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have physical access to the victim's unlocked device.
*   The attacker doesn't need to know the passcode.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Telegram on October 10, 2019.
