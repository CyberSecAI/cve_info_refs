  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2020-10369",
      "description": "Spectra vulnerabilities allow an attacker with code execution on a Bluetooth chip to escalate privileges to the Wi-Fi chip due to insufficient isolation between them. This is possible because of how spectrum coordination is handled between the two chips using hardware based co-existence mechanisms that facilitate data transfer by packet based real-time decisions.",
      "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is the insufficient isolation between wireless chips (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) that share the same spectrum, allowing an attacker to escalate privileges from one chip to the other by exploiting hardware-based co-existence mechanisms.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient isolation between wireless chips",
        "Vulnerabilities in hardware-based co-existence mechanisms"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker with code execution on a Bluetooth chip can escalate privileges to the Wi-Fi chip. This could lead to a lateral denial of service attack, information leakage, or code execution on the target chip. Furthermore, the ability to move from Bluetooth to Wi-Fi bypasses security boundaries which may exist between the Bluetooth and the operating system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Exploitation of co-existence mechanisms via serial interfaces",
        "Code execution on Bluetooth chip"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the Bluetooth chip. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth part of the operating system.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability affects devices using combination chips from Broadcom and Cypress including iPhones, MacBooks, Samsung Galaxy S series, Raspberry Pis, and fitness trackers. The issue resides in the hardware and is difficult to mitigate without severe performance penalties."
