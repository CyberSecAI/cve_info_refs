Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors:
    - A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Microsoft Teams chat functionality, specifically within user "mentions".
    - Bypasses of AngularJS expression injection protections, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
    - Abusing Microsoft Teams APIs to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The `displayName` parameter within the mentions functionality is vulnerable to stored XSS. Specifically, it allows injection of AngularJS expressions.
*   **AngularJS Sandbox Escape:** The injected AngularJS expressions can bypass the intended sandbox restrictions using a null byte character (`\u0000`) and other techniques, which allows arbitrary JavaScript execution.
*   **CSP Bypass:** The AngularJS sandbox escape can be used to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions.
*   **Insecure API Usage:** The exploit leverages Microsoft Teams APIs, specifically `desktopFileDownload` and `allowWindowOpenUrl`, to download a malicious file and use it as a preload for a webview, effectively achieving RCE.
*   **ElectronJS security bypass**: Bypasses restrictions like `remote-require` being disabled, `nodeIntegration` being `false`, and webview creation filtering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine (Windows, macOS, Linux) without user interaction.
*   **SSO Token Stealing:** Attackers can steal SSO tokens stored in the browser's local storage, potentially gaining access to other Microsoft services (Office365, Outlook, etc.).
*   **Data Theft/Exposure:** Attackers can access private conversations, files, call logs, and other sensitive information within MS Teams.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability could be used to escalate privileges to an MS Teams organization administrator.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality and Integrity:** Full access to the victim's machine, internal network, and personal data, both within and outside of MS Teams.
*   **Wormable:** The vulnerability can be used to create a worm that spreads automatically to other users and organizations, including guest users.
*   **Microphone/Camera Access:** Via XSS, attackers can potentially access a user's microphone and camera, at least on web versions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Chat Message:** The attack is triggered by sending or editing a chat message containing a specially crafted mention.
*   **No User Interaction:** The exploit is executed when a victim views the malicious chat message, without any further action required from their end.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Teams User:** The attacker needs to be a member of a Microsoft Teams organization or a guest in an organization.
*   **Message Sending/Editing:** The attacker needs to be able to send or edit chat messages to the target user or channel.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft, who initially rated it as "Important, Spoofing", which the researcher considered inadequate given the severity of the impact.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by Microsoft at the end of October 2020.
* The report includes example code snippets for achieving both XSS and RCE, including different payloads for different purposes (e.g. local storage exfiltration and RCE via webview).
