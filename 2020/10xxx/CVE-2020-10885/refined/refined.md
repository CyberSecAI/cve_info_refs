- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of DNS responses before further processing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation of DNS responses.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on affected TP-Link Archer A7 AC1750 routers.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, and authentication is not required. The attacker leverages the improper handling of DNS responses in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted DNS response to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required.
