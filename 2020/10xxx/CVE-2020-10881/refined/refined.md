- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of DNS responses.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A fixed-length stack-based buffer is overflowed due to a crafted DNS message.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via crafted DNS messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, indicating that a remote, unauthenticated attacker can trigger it by sending a malicious DNS message.
