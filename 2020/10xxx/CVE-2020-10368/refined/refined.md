  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability, dubbed Spectra, arises from the coordination mechanisms between wireless chips (like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) that share the same spectrum. These coordination mechanisms, often implemented as serial interfaces in hardware, are designed to prevent collisions and improve performance. However, vulnerabilities in these mechanisms can be exploited to cross boundaries between wireless chips.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Vulnerabilities in spectrum coordination mechanisms between wireless chips.",
      "Hardware-level implementation of coordination mechanisms makes it difficult to patch with OS updates.",
      "Manufacturer-specific extensions to coordination mechanisms can allow code execution on other chips.",
       "Lack of proper isolation between Bluetooth and Wi-Fi components on combination chips."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker gaining code execution on a Bluetooth chip can escalate to the Wi-Fi chip and potentially further into the operating system, effectively bypassing traditional security boundaries between wireless technologies. This enables a range of attacks:\n\t* Denial of service: One wireless core can prevent the other from transmitting data.\n\t* Information leakage: One core can extract details about the other core's activities.\n\t* Code execution: One core can execute malicious code on the other core.",
    "attack_vectors": "Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the coexistence mechanisms used by chips that share spectrum, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips. By compromising the Bluetooth chip, an attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to access the Wi-Fi chip. The attack relies on the close proximity of the chips and/or shared antennas, which require precise timing and/or code execution on a wireless core.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs some level of control over one wireless chip (e.g., Bluetooth), either through code execution or by observing precise timing of packet transmissions. The attack is made more difficult by security updates that prevent direct writing to the Bluetooth chip's RAM from the OS, though it does not remove the underlying hardware vulnerabilities."
