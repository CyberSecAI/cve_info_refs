Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-10230

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `term` parameter within the `loader_ajax.php` file, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `term` parameter in `loader_ajax.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection. Both error-based and time-based SQL injection techniques are possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
  - **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
  - **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
  - **Potential System Compromise:** Depending on the database configuration, further system compromise could be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `loader_ajax.php` with a malicious payload in the `term` parameter.
  - Example URLs:
    - Error-Based SQLi: `https://{DOMAIN_NAME}:2031/cwp_{SESSION_HASH}/admin/loader_ajax.php?ajax=dashboard&action=searchIn&term=a' AND (SELECT 1197 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x716b6a7171,(SELECT (ELT(1197=1197,1))),0x71707a7671,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)-- aRuO`
    - Time-Based SQLi: `https://{DOMAIN_NAME}:2031/cwp_{SESSION_HASH}/admin/loader_ajax.php?ajax=dashboard&action=searchIn&term=a' OR SLEEP(5)-- JCpP`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the CWP instance.
- **Authenticated Session:** The attacker needs a valid `cwp_{SESSION_HASH}` to access the vulnerable page (the attack occurs in the admin panel).

**Additional Notes:**

- The exploit information specifies that the vulnerability affects versions v6 and v7 of Centos WebPanel.
- The provided changelog mentions a "[SECURITY] Implementation of anti XSS token for the GUI" in version 0.9.8.651 – 0.9.8.747, and "SECURITY BUG FIXED Prevention of Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Attack" in version 0.9.8.291 – 0.9.8.314. However, it doesn't mention anything about SQL injection, meaning this vulnerability was likely discovered and patched later.
- The exploit-db entry provides specific payloads for both Error-Based and Time-Based SQL injection, demonstrating the concrete nature of the vulnerability.
