- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Badge images were not being proxied.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The lack of proxying for badge images caused mixed content warnings and exposed the user's IP address.
-  **Impact of exploitation**: Leaking the user's IP address.
- **Attack vectors**:  Accessing badge images in GitLab.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker would not need specific access but to simply trigger the loading of badge images on a victim's browser.
