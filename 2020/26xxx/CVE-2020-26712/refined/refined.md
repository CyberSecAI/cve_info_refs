Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection in ToDoList function (CVE-2020-26712)**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `sort` parameter of `redcap_v10.3.4/ToDoList/index.php`. The application directly uses this parameter in a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization, allowing for arbitrary SQL execution.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Spoof identity
    *   Tamper with existing data
    *   Cause repudiation issues (voiding transactions, changing balances)
    *   Disclosure of all data
    *   Data destruction
    *   Gain administrative privileges on the database server
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP GET request to `redcap_v10.3.4/ToDoList/index.php` with a malicious `sort` parameter containing SQL commands.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to craft an HTTP GET request
    *   No special privileges required.

**Vulnerability 2: Reflected XSS in ToDoList function (CVE-2020-26712)**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `sort` parameter of `redcap_v10.3.4/ToDoList/index.php`. The application echoes the parameter back in the HTTP response without proper escaping or encoding.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *  Stealing login session information.
    * Borrowing user rights to perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP GET request to `redcap_v10.3.4/ToDoList/index.php` with a malicious `sort` parameter containing JavaScript.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to craft an HTTP GET request
    *   Ability to trick a user to visit the crafted URL.
