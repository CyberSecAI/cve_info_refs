{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Mesh Provisioning procedure in Bluetooth Mesh Profile Specification versions 1.0 and 1.0.1 is vulnerable when the AuthValue is predictable or has low entropy, allowing brute-force attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Predictable or low-entropy AuthValue in Bluetooth Mesh provisioning.",
      "Lack of proper randomness in AuthValue selection during Mesh Provisioning."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can brute force the AuthValue, authenticate to both the Provisioner and provisioned devices, and conduct a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on future provisioning attempts using the same AuthValue.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker needs to be within wireless range of a Mesh Provisioner.",
       "An attacker must be able to observe or take part in the provisioning process in order to brute force the AuthValue."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to capture provisioning data, including provisioning random and confirmation values and the ability to perform a brute-force attack. An attacker within wireless range of the devices involved in the provisioning is required."
