# SAP Security Patch Day November 2020: SAP Solution Manager Affected Again by Two Serious Vulnerabilities

By:
[Thomas Fritsch](#author)

November 10, 2020

![SAP Security Notes Blog](https://onapsis.com/wp-content/uploads/SAP-Security-Notes-20.jpg)

Highlights of November SAP Security Notes analysis include:

* **November Summary**—19 new and updated SAP security patches released, including six *HotNews* Notes and three *High Priority* notes
* **Contribution of the Onapsis Research Labs**—The Onapsis Research Labs supported SAP in patching two *HotNews* and two *Medium Priority* notes, covering five vulnerabilities in total
* **Critical Chromium Update**—CVSS score of the periodically recurring SAP Security Note #[2622660](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2622660), reflecting the all-time high, was set from 9.8 to 10

SAP has published 19 new and updated Security Notes on its November Patch Day. This number includes six *HotNews* notes and three *High Priority* notes.

SAP Solution Manager (SolMan) remains the focus of this month’s SAP Patch Day, in which SAP has patched two vulnerabilities for this major technical component that is present in each customer’s system landscape—both rated with a CVSS score of 10. While updates of existing notes often contain only some minor extensions and corrections to a note’s text, SAP Security Note #[2890213](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2890213) demonstrates that they can also include additional patches on newly detected vulnerabilities. And, as if two critical patches weren’t enough, among other SAP applications, SAP SolMan is also affected by a Privilege Escalation Vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java.

Another remarkable aspect of SAP’s November Patch Day is the fact that the periodically recurring SAP Security Note for SAP Business Client #[2622660](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2622660) is now tagged with a CVSS score of 10.

More details and a summary of all critical SAP Security Notes can be found in the below sections.

### In Focus: SAP Solution Manager

After contributing to SAP by fixing multiple critical issues in the LM-Service in the past, the Onapsis Research Labs detected another issue with that service affecting Support Package 11 Patch level 2 of the SOLMANDIAG 720 software component. The vulnerability allowed remote authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands in the connected SMDAgents. The corresponding patch was now released with an update of SAP Security Note #[2890213](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2890213) titled, “[CVE-2020-6207] Missing Authentication Check in SAP Solution Manager” and tagged with the highest possible CVSS score of 10.

SAP Security Note #[2985866](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2985866) is also tagged with a CVSS score of 10 and fixes other Missing Authentication issues in the LM-Service software component. These issues have a negative impact to the integrity and availability of this service as well as of four dependent services.

Last but not least, the set of *HotNews* notes affecting SAP SolMan also includes *HotNews* SAP Security Note #[2979062](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2979062), tagged with a CVSS score of 9.1. The Onapsis Research Labs detected this issue some weeks ago and helped SAP in patching the vulnerability. The patch fixes a bug in SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java which allows authenticated users in SAP to escalate to OS commands in the vulnerable system, and therefore lead to a full compromise of every service and piece of information running on top of it. The note fixes the segregation between the OS and the JAVA NetWeaver Web Interface, which is crucial and should be highly isolated. SAP NetWeaver AS Java administrators shouldn’t have access to the OS of the SAP system. SAP NetWeaver AS Java acts as a foundational layer for several products of SAP, such as Solution Manager, SAP Portal, SAP PI/PO and others.

### Further Contribution From the Onapsis Research Labs

Onapsis researcher [Gaston Traberg](https://onapsis.com/blog/author/gaston-traberg) detected multiple vulnerabilities in SAP Commerce Cloud that were also fixed by SAP on this November Patch Day.

*High Priority* note #[2975170](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2975170) patches a Denial of Service vulnerability, tagged with a CVSS score of 7.5, and a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability that is tagged with a CVSS score of 5.3. Both vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated attacker to submit a specially crafted request over the network to a particular SAP Commerce module URL which will be processed without further interaction. While an exploit of the first vulnerability can lead to complete unavailability of the SAP Commerce service, exploiting the second one only results in obtaining access to limited information about the service.

*High Priority* note #[2975189](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2975189), also tagged with a CVSS score of 7.5, addresses an Information Disclosure vulnerability in SAP Commerce Cloud. An attacker can bypass existing authentication and permission checks via a special endpoint in SAP Commerce, hence gaining access to Secure Media folders. These folders could contain sensitive files that result in disclosure of sensitive information and impact system configuration confidentiality.

### Other Critical SAP Security Notes in November

On an average bi-monthly frequency, SAP releases updates for *HotNews* SAP Security Note #[2622660](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2622660), providing a new update of the Chromium version that is shipped with SAP Business Client patch. The related CVSS score is always based on the all-time high of all fixed vulnerabilities. While this value didn’t change for more than a year, it has increased now with the newest patch from 9.8 to 10. The increase seems to be caused by a critical flaw (CVE-2020-15967) in Chrome’s payments component. Following Google’s information, the flaw is a use-after-free vulnerability. Use-after-free is a memory-corruption flaw where an attempt is made to access memory after it has been freed. This can cause various malicious impacts, from causing a program to crash, to potentially leading to execution of arbitrary code. Checking all three references for the latest Chromium update, use-after-free vulnerabilities represent more than 30% of all vulnerabilities—most of them rated as *High Priority*.

*HotNews* SAP Security Note #[2982840](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2982840) fixes a Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVSS 9.8) and a Denial of Service vulnerability (CVSS 7.5) in SAP Data Services. An insufficient input validation allows an unauthenticated attacker to send malicious requests that could result in remote code execution and thus, a complete compromise of system confidentiality, integrity and availability.

The second vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to override access permissions which can completely compromise the availability of the service.

*HotNews* SAP Security Note #[2928635](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2928635), patching a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Knowledge Management and tagged with a CVSS score of 9, was originally released in August 2020. It contains updated correction information for NetWeaver 7.50 SP12.

*High Priority* SAP Security Note #[2984627](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2984627) patches a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability and a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in SAP Fiori Launchpad News Tile Application. The first one is tagged with a CVSS score of 8.6 and allows unauthorized attackers to access confidential data on internal systems behind firewalls. An insufficient encoding of user controlled input allows an exploit of the second vulnerability. An attacker could send malicious code to another end user and can thus gain information that is maintained in this end user’s browser.

### Summary & Conclusions

With 19 SAP Security Notes since SAP’s last Patch Day, including six *HotNews* notes and three *High Priority* notes, this month is above average when looking at the number of critical notes. We have once more seen that Solution Manager will keep security administrators busy, because of its central role in the system landscape and the criticality of the newly detected vulnerabilities. Onapsis recommends that the released patches are applied as soon as possible.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
