{
  "CVE-2020-26811": {
    "Root cause": "The SAP Hybris acceleratorservices module lacks proper authentication checks, allowing arbitrary HTTP requests.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
        "Missing authentication"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can bypass network restrictions to make arbitrary HTTP requests, potentially accessing internal resources. Additionally, a self-referenced request can lead to a denial of service by consuming all memory resources.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can access the vulnerable extension and send custom POST requests to any valid URL.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SAP Hybris instance."
  }
