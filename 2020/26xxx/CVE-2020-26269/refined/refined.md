{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read in the `GetMatchingPaths` function during filesystem glob matching. The `dir_index` variable is incremented unconditionally, leading to an out-of-bounds access when matching directory paths against a globbing pattern.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a crash, potentially leading to a denial of service via a segmentation fault when a specific file system structure is provided during a glob operation.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by using the `tf.io.gfile.glob` function with a specially crafted path, for example, a directory that contains a single file.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `tf.io.gfile.glob` function with a specific file system structure. The attacker needs to have access to the system to create and access file system entries.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the parallel implementation of `GetMatchingPaths` within the tensorflow library.  The fix involves a complete rewrite of the implementation, adding helper functions and documenting invariants and preconditions to validate each major step. The vulnerability impacts master branch and release candidates for TensorFlow version 2.4, but is patched in the 2.4.0 release."
