The provided content is related to CVE-2020-26238.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a Template Injection flaw within the cron-utils library. Specifically, the library was susceptible to arbitrary Java EL expressions being injected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Template Injection: The core vulnerability is a failure to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input when constructing EL expressions.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): This vulnerability allows for unauthenticated Remote Code Execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve unauthenticated Remote Code Execution by injecting malicious Java EL expressions, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing specially crafted cron expressions when using the @Cron annotation for validation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide untrusted cron expressions to the vulnerable application if the @Cron annotation is being used to validate the user-provided input.

**Additional details:**
- The affected versions are those prior to 9.1.3.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 9.1.3.
- The advisory specifies that only projects using the `@Cron` annotation to validate untrusted Cron expressions are affected.
