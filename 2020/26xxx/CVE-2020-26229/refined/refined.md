Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26229:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the processing of XML external entities (XXE) in RSS widgets within the TYPO3 CMS dashboard. Specifically, the RSS widget is susceptible to XXE processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core weakness is the failure to properly sanitize or disable external entity processing when parsing XML data from RSS feeds in the dashboard widgets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure (Low):** While the advisory notes this vulnerability is theoretical and hard to exploit, the potential impact would be information disclosure, although limited. An attacker could potentially read local files or internal resources if they could trigger the processing of malicious external entities.
*   **Denial of Service (Low):** The vulnerability could also lead to a denial of service if an attacker is able to trigger the processing of an external entity that is causing the system to become overloaded.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious RSS Feed:** An attacker could inject malicious XML code with external entity references into an RSS feed.
*   **Dashboard Widget Manipulation:** A logged in backend user needs to add and configure the malicious RSS feed in a dashboard widget to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Backend Access:** The attacker requires a valid backend user account with permissions to add and configure dashboard widgets.
*   **Ability to Inject Malicious XML:** The attacker needs to be able to supply malicious XML content that includes external entity references.
*   **User Interaction:** The backend user needs to configure the RSS widget with the malicious feed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory explicitly states that the vulnerability is theoretical, as it was not reproducible with current PHP versions and *libxml2* version 2.9 which disables XXE processing by default.
*   The fix involves updating to TYPO3 version 10.4.10, which addresses the XXE vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is considered Low severity due to the limited impact and the requirements for successful exploitation.
