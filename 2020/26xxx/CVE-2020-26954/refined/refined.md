{
  "cveId": "CVE-2020-26954",
  "description": "When accepting a malicious intent from other installed apps, Firefox for Android accepted manifests from arbitrary file paths and allowed declaring webapp manifests for other origins. This could be used to gain fullscreen access for UI spoofing and could also lead to cross-origin attacks on targeted websites.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `LauncherActivity` in Fenix (Firefox for Android) is publicly accessible, allowing any application to inject an arbitrary PWA manifest for any origin. This activity receives a `MANIFEST_PATH` key from an incoming intent and stores the specified manifest file to internal manifest database.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Publicly accessible `LauncherActivity` in Fenix allows arbitrary manifest injection.",
       "Lack of validation of manifest file paths."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject a malicious PWA manifest, causing the browser to launch the specified website in full screen without an address bar, enabling UI spoofing and potential cross-origin attacks.",
    "attackVectors": "A malicious application on the same device can send an intent to Firefox for Android specifying an arbitrary manifest file path via the `MANIFEST_PATH` key. The `LauncherActivity` will process the intent and install the provided manifest file."
    ,"requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the user's Android device that can send intents to the Firefox for Android application."
  },
  "affectedProducts": [
    "Firefox for Android"
  ],
  "fixedVersions": [
    "Firefox 83"
  ],
   "additionalNotes": "The issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected."
