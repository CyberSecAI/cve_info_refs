# Cloudera Data Engineering service

Cloudera Data Engineering (CDE) is a serverless service for Cloudera Data Platform that
allows you to submit batch jobs to auto-scaling virtual clusters. CDE enables you to spend more
time on your applications, and less time on infrastructure.

noteCDE is currently available only on Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure.

Cloudera Data Engineering allows you to create, manage, and schedule
Apache Spark jobs without the overhead of creating and maintaining Spark
clusters. With Cloudera Data Engineering, you define virtual clusters with
a range of CPU and memory resources, and the cluster scales up and down as
needed to run your Spark workloads, helping to control your cloud
costs.

The CDE service involves several components:

Environment
A logical subset of your cloud provider account including a specific
virtual network. For more information, see [Environments](https://docs.cloudera.com/management-console/cloud/overview/topics/mc-core-concepts.html).
CDE Service
The long-running Kubernetes cluster and services that manage the
virtual clusters. The CDE service must be enabled on an environment
before you can create any virtual clusters.
Virtual Cluster
An individual auto-scaling cluster with defined CPU and memory
ranges. Virtual Clusters in CDE can be created and deleted on demand.
Jobs are associated with clusters.
Jobs
Application code along with defined configurations and resources.
Jobs can be run on demand or scheduled. An individual job execution is
called a job run.
Resource
A defined collection of files such as a Python file or application
JAR, dependencies, and any other reference files required for a
job.
Job run
An individual job run.

The CDE service differs from a Data Engineering Data Hub cluster in
several ways, including the following:

Table 1. Cloudera Data Engineering Service vs. Data Engineering Data Hub
| Feature | Cloudera Data Engineering | Data Hub DE Template |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud providers | Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure | Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure |
| Compute engines | Apache Spark | Apache Spark, Apache Hive |
| Deployment | Kubernetes | Virtual machines (cloud provider) |
| Resource management | Yunikorn, Kubernetes | YARN |
| Troubleshooting | CDE deep analysis, Spark History Server | Spark History Server |
| Portability | Public/private cloud | Public cloud |
| Job submission | Managed API | Apache Livy |
