Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that ServiceWorker intercepted channels in Firefox did not enforce MIME type restrictions when serving cached responses. Specifically, the MIME type checks that were normally performed by `nsHttpChannel` were not being applied to the channels created for ServiceWorker interceptions. This meant that a script with an incorrect MIME type (e.g., `text/csv` instead of `application/javascript`) could be executed if served through a ServiceWorker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Missing MIME Type Checks:** The primary weakness is the absence of MIME type validation for resources served via ServiceWorker interceptions, bypassing standard security measures.
-  **Incorrect Channel Type:** The issue arose because ServiceWorker interceptions used a different channel type (`HttpBaseChannel`) that did not inherit the MIME type check logic from `nsHttpChannel`.
-  **Bypass of Security Restrictions**: The lack of MIME type checking allowed for bypassing script inclusion security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI):** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject and execute malicious scripts on a website by serving them with incorrect MIME types through a malicious ServiceWorker.
-   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Bypass:** The vulnerability could also bypass Content Security Policy, as the browser would execute scripts that CSP was intended to block.
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution**: By injecting scripts into websites, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the user's browser, leading to various malicious actions.
-  **Data Theft**: Scripts could be used to steal sensitive information, such as cookies, session data, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Service Worker:** An attacker could craft a malicious ServiceWorker that intercepts requests for scripts and serves malicious content with an incorrect MIME type.
-   **Cache Poisoning**: By taking over an existing Service Worker, an attacker can serve malicious scripts from legitimate domains.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Register a Service Worker**: An attacker needs to be able to register a malicious ServiceWorker on a website or compromise a website with a vulnerable Service Worker.
-   **Knowledge of ServiceWorker APIs:** Attackers need to be proficient in using service worker fetch events and other APIs to intercept requests and inject malicious payloads.
-  **Network Access (in some cases):** To inject payloads or modify server responses, attackers may need some level of access to network communications.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability was rated as "sec-moderate".
- The fix involved moving the MIME type check logic from `nsHttpChannel` to the base class `HttpBaseChannel` to ensure consistent application across all channel types.
- The issue was fixed in Firefox 83, ESR 78.5, and Thunderbird 78.5.
- The bug report includes a proof of concept and details the code change.
- The original report of the vulnerability was made by Moti Harmats.

The fix was made by refactoring the MIME type warnings into the base class `HttpBaseChannel`. The security advisory notes that this vulnerability could lead to cross-site scripting inclusion or a Content Security Policy bypass, which is also confirmed in the bug report and the related discussions.
