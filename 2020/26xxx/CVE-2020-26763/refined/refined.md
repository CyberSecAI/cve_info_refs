Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26763:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Rocket.Chat desktop application, specifically version 2.17.11, was vulnerable because it could open external links without requiring any user interaction. This indicates a lack of proper permission handling or security controls related to opening external resources. Additionally, the pull request description mentions "poisoning some preload routines", hinting at a vulnerability in how preload scripts were handled, which might allow malicious injection or modification of these scripts, leading to the ability to open external links without user interaction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Lack of User Interaction Requirement for External Links:** The primary vulnerability is that the application could open external URLs without the user explicitly initiating or approving the action.
2.  **Preload Script Vulnerability:** There's a mention of "poisoning some preload routines," indicating a possible injection or manipulation vulnerability in how the application handles preload scripts.
3.  **Inadequate Context Isolation:** The pull request title and content suggest a lack of proper context isolation between the main application and webviews. This lack of isolation could enable the poisoning of preload routines and unauthorized opening of external links.
4. **`openExternal` Handling:** The pull request specifically mentions issues with the handling of `openExternal`, which is an electron API used to open external URLs in the user's default browser. This is the main vector exploited.
5. **Missing permission handling:** The lack of proper permission request handling allowed the application to open external links without proper authorization from the user

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to:
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Open malicious links that could lead to phishing websites, attempting to steal user credentials or other sensitive information.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Redirect the user to a webpage hosting malware.
*   **Unwanted Redirects:** Redirect users to arbitrary websites.
* **Exfiltration:** Potentially open an external link to an attacker controlled site to exfiltrate information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Rocket.Chat Instance:**  A malicious Rocket.Chat instance could be created by an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Injected/Modified Preload Scripts:** Attackers could potentially inject or modify preload scripts to trigger the vulnerable code.
* **Crafted Messages/Links:** Malicious messages with crafted links embedded within them could be used to initiate the opening of external links without user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to a Rocket.Chat Instance:** The attacker would need the ability to either host or compromise a Rocket.Chat instance.
*  **Ability to send messages/control displayed links**: The attacker needs the ability to control the content that is displayed by the RocketChat application, in order to trigger the external link opening.

**Additional Details:**
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves several steps, including enabling context isolation, handling `openExternal` permission requests, and using a custom session partition for webviews.
*   The pull request associated with this fix was initially marked as a draft due to breaking camera and microphone permissions, which were later addressed.
* The issue was fixed with the merging of the pull request #1710

In summary, CVE-2020-26763 describes a vulnerability in the Rocket.Chat desktop application where it could open external links without user consent, potentially leading to various malicious outcomes like phishing and malware distribution.
