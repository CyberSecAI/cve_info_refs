|  | |

When fuzzing Firefox clipboard API content sanitization on pasting, I found sanitizer bypass with payload `<svg><style><image href=1 onerror=alert(document.domain)>`. When user copy from crafted malicious website, then paste the content, XSS will execute. It leads to universal XSS on latest stable release of Firefox, Firefox 78.3.0esr (64-bit), and Firefox Nightly 82.0a1 (2020-09-20).

## Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to <https://sourc7.appspot.com/bugzilla/0447f4d26c48bd8d0526dce173f57b3ac5235b7b.html>
2. Click Copy Text
3. Go to <https://output.jsbin.com/gocizet/> (TinyMCE Rich Editor form)
4. Paste with Ctrl+V or Right click -> Paste into TinyMCE form
5. XSS will execute [pop alert(document.domain)]

Not sure what should be done here (Edit: because it seems the handler is not directly called by tree builder). Pinging Henri who suggested the previous solution:

Without testing, my guess is that we remove element children of SVG `style` but since disconnected image nodes load their `src` for compat with Netscape <= 4.x, we end up loading processing the loading for the empty-string `src` and running the `onerror` handler.

Perhaps we need to change node removal in the sanitizer to iterate over the subtree rooted at the node being removed and remove all attributes in it.

HTML `img` element loading (at least per the HTML standard) does an active document check. It seems we should do a similar check for SVG `image` elements. It seems that only fixing this at the sanitizer level would still make us execute script as part of `XMLHttpRequest` or `DOMParser` or some such, right?

(Also, would fixing this at the sanitizer level prevent all network activity?)

Somehow this does not call onerror:

The attached patch so far implements only the attribute removal hack, not Anne's suggestion of a document marked as "loaded as data".

Per <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/c2e3ac11be4837718c2604e58085fbc8252b69dd/editor/libeditor/HTMLEditorDataTransfer.cpp#3241> , we parse using the document that is being edited as the owner document for the nodes during the node creation. Other than performance, would there be downsides to parsing with a distinct throw-away document marked as "loaded as data"?

(In reply to Kagami :saschanaz from [comment #8](/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - XSS via paste and Clipboard API and SVG + image onerror handler"))

> Somehow this does not call onerror:

That's because `DOMParser` parses into a document marked as "loaded as data".

The attached patch is sufficient for fixing the reported problem from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - XSS via paste and Clipboard API and SVG + image onerror handler"), though.

Hmm. While a "loaded as data" document might be nice as a defense-in-depth mechanism, it won't help `innerHTML` in chrome, unless we also de-optimize `innerHTML` in chrome not to parser directly into the target document.

[Bug 1666300](/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300 "VERIFIED FIXED - XSS via paste and Clipboard API and SVG + image onerror handler") part 1 - Remove attributes from descendants when setting sanitized style.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Very easily from part 1; less so from part 2. (If we really wanted to, we could defer part 1.) Note that while this bug is sec-moderate, this is relates to [bug 1667113](/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113 "VERIFIED FIXED - mXSS payload (combined svg, style, title element) lead to HTML Sanitizer Bypass and XSS via Clipboard API (paste)"), which is sec-high and should land together. However, I consider this one more severe than the other one, because the other one is itself about a defense-in-depth mechanism and is already mitigated by *another* defense-in-depth mechanism.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: Yes
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: all
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: No
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: Either the same patch applies or it will be a mechanical rebase
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Not very likely: Regressions are likely to break the entire mochitest test harness (and did during development), so now that the harness works again, I expect things to be OK.

Arturo, do you know if we're sending a private mode cookie (?) when downloading?

I guess this means we'd be leaking PB mode to the site, not sure what impact that has though.

On ac, we don't manage cookies when downloading, GeckoView owns the cookies. I'm not sure how it manages cookies internally :owlish could help us to clarify. What I'm aware of it's that [we are not indicating](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/200fcd74905eff3f9b1672e96b1b0216634d9fe7/components/browser/engine-gecko-nightly/src/main/java/mozilla/components/browser/engine/gecko/fetch/GeckoViewFetchClient.kt#L57) to the `GeckoWebExecutor` (the piece that does the download) that we are on a private mode. I can see a flag [FETCH\_FLAGS\_PRIVATE](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/geckoview/src/main/java/org/mozilla/geckoview/GeckoWebExecutor.java#97) but it's package private.

Another thing is that we are on the middle of moving away from this api see [AC #8312](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/8312). I'm not aware either how cookies are manage with this new api.

I'm not familiar with the internal architecture but the HTTP request of `<a href download>` from Fenix has `MozacFetch` in `User-Agent` header (see the attached gif image in detail).

It seems the request is sent from the downloads feature of android-component.

Yes, it's initiated from `android-component` but the underneath api that it is performing the download it's part of GeckoView [see](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/200fcd74905eff3f9b1672e96b1b0216634d9fe7/components/browser/engine-gecko-nightly/src/main/java/mozilla/components/browser/engine/gecko/fetch/GeckoViewFetchClient.kt#L64) and [GeckoWebExecutor](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/geckoview/src/main/java/org/mozilla/geckoview/GeckoWebExecutor.java).

Re: cookies. I am not clear what the question is exactly, Arturo, can you clarify? Also, I'd need some explanation on "private mode cookies", as I am not aware what they are. Is that how browsing mode works in Fenix?

Also, and this is a bit unrelated, but since this bug is about cookies, it would be nice to see the actual cookie exchange for the requests (I only see the requests' method, URIs and response status on the attached gif, and I don't see any other information) - like a HAR file, for example. At the moment, it's not clear to me what is going on.

Oh, I just accidentally scrolled down on the gif and saw the rest of the info in the gif. Apparently, we're talking about `user=priv` cookie? I am still not clear what that cookie or what sets it.

The way GV API works, the API users are supposed to set the `FETCH_FLAGS_ANONYMOUS` flag on the download. With that flag, the cookies are not supposed to be passed. Am I understanding the bug correctly that the flag is set but the cookies are still being passed?

Looking at the source code, I see the flag is set [of CookiePolicy.OMIT flag is set](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/200fcd74905eff3f9b1672e96b1b0216634d9fe7/components/browser/engine-gecko-nightly/src/main/java/mozilla/components/browser/engine/gecko/fetch/GeckoViewFetchClient.kt#L64) but I can't trace where `CookiePolicy.OMIT` is set. Where is it being set, Arturo?

Also, Arturo, does the bug reproduce in the latest GVE? Does it reproduce in GVE at all? And clarification on the question and the browsing mode cookies is still needed :)

The issue is that the user is navigating in private session, and as a result of downloading a file, a cookie get written (`user=priv`). This cookie must be only available on private browsing but it's getting shared with normal sessions. As if the download were performed on a normal session.

Ok, that is the issue, we are not passing this flag, when downloading that is causing the issue. We have to fix that.

I'm no sure we have to tests on it. Do you know if with the new GV API is aware of the type of session (private/nomal) where download is performed? Or from ac we have to do something special?

On the new API you wouldn't have to do anything special, it should work automatically. You have to set these WebExecutor flags now because now you have to perform a separate request for the downloads. With the new API, the need in the second request is eliminated, and the info on the browsing mode should already be in the channel by the time the download starts.

I agree with the `sec-moderate` rating Andrew gave it earlier.

> The way GV API works, the API users are supposed to set the FETCH\_FLAGS\_ANONYMOUS flag on the download. With that flag, the cookies are not supposed to be passed. Am I understanding the bug correctly that the flag is set but the cookies are still being passed?

That doesn't sound right. A download might require a cookie to work and ANONYMOUS would break that. Private Browsing isn't about not having cookies at all (web sites break!), it's about *not saving* the cookies to disk and *not mixing* them with your "normal" cookies. There are a *lot* of things tied up in Private Browsing that you won't be able to emulate from the front end. It's a "mode" that has to be supported in APIs (usually hung off a browsing context) from GeckoView through Android Components to the front end.

Private Browsing is implemented similarly to "Containers" in Gecko [kinda, for some things] so if you have to change APIs keep that in mind because it would be killer to be able to support Containers in a mobile browser.

That is exactly why we have just replaced that API with the new one, that doesn't require the second request.

So we are passing the `private` flag from the session to `DownloadState` so that we can control out fetch flags, which will set `FETCH\_FLAGS\_ANONYMOUS` for requests on behalf of a private tab when using `GeckoWebExecutor`. That sounds good to me. r+
But I do wonder if we have a related (for a new bug to file) problem here: If I am in a private tab and perform a download request, that we didn't get via the new API (e.g. for "save as", or when retrying a download) then we have no way of linking it to an existing, private `GeckoSession` to make use of the cookies available to that session. Is this something we would want to make possible or should at least discuss further in a separate bug?

        } else {
            Request.CookiePolicy.INCLUDE

```

I don't know the Fenix code, but "OMIT" sounds like no cookies at all rather than "use cookies from the PRIVATE cookie jar". That's certainly better than leaking the non-private cookies! But I'm pretty sure that's not web-compatible with some sites.

I agree, we should improve the name, I filed the issue [#8430](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/8430) on AC for it. On ac `Request.CookiePolicy.OMIT` [gets translated](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/a1a5c582c28386a55f9dcc50f10f4a3011dd3742/components/browser/engine-gecko-nightly/src/main/java/mozilla/components/browser/engine/gecko/fetch/GeckoViewFetchClient.kt#L59) to GV as [GeckoWebExecutor.FETCH\_FLAGS\_ANONYMOUS](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/geckoview/src/main/java/org/mozilla/geckoview/GeckoWebExecutor.java#76), I think ideally we should be using something like [GeckoWebExecutor.FETCH\_FLAGS\_PRIVATE](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/geckoview/src/main/java/org/mozilla/geckoview/GeckoWebExecutor.java#97) but we don't have access from AC as it's package private on GV.

Verified this by comparing Beta 83.0 with RC 82.1.1:

After downloading the test file in private mode there is a "user: priv" cookie set.

Going to normal mode, just by loading the test page on RC 82 you can see that cookie already set, while on Beta 83 the cookie is not showing up on the page request in normal mode.

When you download the file in normal mode (with or without having set cookies in private mode), the cookie created has the same name so it is hard to tell if it's being transferred or is a different one, but I suppose that is expected. @Arturo, can you confirm?

Otherwise, this looks like it is fixed on Fenix 83.0 Beta.

Yes, it could be a bit confusing. As the site is not aware in which mode we are it just writes the cookie when the file is downloaded.

I tested on [Fenix 83 Beta](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/releases/tag/v83.0.0-beta.1) and I wasn't able to simulated the issue. If you would like to retest, one way to know that you are starting in clean state is by **Deleting the browsing data** or **Clearing the app storage** both should have the same effect as both clean all the data of Fenix.

If you need any additional help just let me know, happy to help :)

Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2020-51

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 78.5

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 78.5

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

##### References

* [Bug 1667113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1642028](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1642028)

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

##### References

* [Bug 1656741](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

##### References

* [Bug 1666300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300)

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1669466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

##### References

* [Bug 1672223](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672223)

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

##### References

* [Bug 1672528](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672528)

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

##### References

* [Bug 1661617](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661617)

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1663571](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571)

#### [#CVE-2020-26968: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 83 and Firefox ESR 78.5](#CVE-2020-26968)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Steve Fink, Jason Kratzer, Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

OS/Firefox version:

Works on Firefox 79.0 (64-bit) using Windows 10 Pro

Works on Nightly 81.0a1 (2020-08-01) (64-bit) using Windows 10 Pro

Works on Firefox 79.0 (64-bit) using macOS Catalina Version 10.15.5

Does *not* work on Firefox 79.0 (64-bit) using Ubuntu 18.04.4 desktop

Repro:

1. Host attached PoC HTML in an HTTP server (localhost will do, if other then make sure its HTTPS)
2. Open the hosted 'letsrepro.html' and click the anchor tag

Result:

Firefox enters full screen mode without the security UI saying you are entering fullscreen appearing.

Expected:

When entering full screen mode, the UI indicating so should always appear to prevent security concerns.

See [Bug 1432856](/show_bug.cgi?id=1432856 "VERIFIED FIXED - Popup window can cover fullscreen security UI")

Other info:

For some reason a WebSocket connection attempt has to happen first for this to work

If I remove 'new WebSocket("ws://nonexistent");' from the PoC, it does not work.

Al, can you take a look at what's going on here? There's some timing involved, I think (I can repro on Windows but not on mac, where we just immediately leave fullscreen again), but not showing the warning is bad.

I also see the symptom of leaving fullscreen immediately on mac and linux.

I can enter the fullscreen and see the warning by clicking the page again.

If I modified the timeout from 260 to 1260, it works fine.

Besides, I don't see any difference between the file with or without 'new WebSocket("ws://nonexistent");'.

```
-			setTimeout(x=>{location='?go#go';}, 260);
+			setTimeout(x=>{location='?go#go';},1260);

```

Hi reporter,

could you try to extend the second timeout and update the result?

Hello triager,

For me the websocket is needed AFAICT. Every time I remove it I stop reproducing. Applying your changes did not result in repro for MacOS.

On MacOS the original repro stopped working but then I modified two things:

```

			setTimeout(()=>{document.body.requestFullscreen({})},106);
			setTimeout(x=>{location='?gfo#go';},200);//<---- lowered the timeout and changed the URL a bit to prevent cache

```

With the above modifications it started working on MacOS and Windows 10 just fine.

My guess is that once you run it, subsequent runs will ruin the timing due to cache. Will work on a more reliable PoC and update if I get one with 100% on all OS. The WebSocket request is probably just adding to the timing aspect, not sure why it is required for me.

I misused the markdown and part of the code above did not show.

```

		new WebSocket("ws://facebook.com");//<----- changed the websocket to an existing domain

			setTimeout(()=>{document.body.requestFullscreen({})},106);
			setTimeout(x=>{location='?gfo#go';},200);//<---- lowered the timeout and changed the URL a bit to prevent cache

(In reply to Abdulrahman Alqabandi from [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Entering fullscreen without UI message showing"))

> Repro:

In the first trial, I test it on a localhost. (<http://localhost:8000>)

The result is in [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - Entering fullscreen without UI message showing").

If I modified the file based on [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - Entering fullscreen without UI message showing") and [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - Entering fullscreen without UI message showing"), I still saw the same symptom.

The symptom is leaving fullscreen immediately on mac and linux.

* changed the websocket to an existing domain
* lowered the timeout (setTimeout(x=>{location='?gfo#go';},200);)

This time I also tried to use "<https://localhost:4443>" to do the test on mac and linux.

In this setup, after clicking the anchor tag, FF won't enter fullscreen with "new WebSocket("ws://facebook.com")" or "new WebSocket("ws://nonexistent");".

If I removed "new WebSocket(...)", the behavior is leaving fullscreen immediately.

I also tried it on Chome. Chome has the same behavior as FF.

:qab, could you also update the behavior of Chome in your setup?

If possible, could you provide the video which can show the problem on your side?

For me, the problem is still unclear.

1. Is the problem related to "new WebSocket()"?
2. Is the problem related to "change the URL right after entering fullscreen"?

:Gijs, is it possible to ask QA to reproduce the symptom?

We need a solid STR to investigate the problem.

I don't think QA have the skills to adapt the testcase to make it 100% reproducible. If they reproduce and you cannot, what's the point?

> We need a solid STR to investigate the problem.

The issue reproduced for me on Windows. (see [comment #1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Entering fullscreen without UI message showing"))

Do you not have access to a Windows machine at all?

I will try to find a windows.

If you can reproduce the problem on windows, could you help to classify these two questions?

In case it makes a difference, I reproduced on Windows by saving the testcase to disk and opening from the file using `file:///`. Of course this means that subsequent requests (on a fast SSD) to the relative `?go#go` link are almost instantaneous.

Without the websocket connection it doesn't reproduce.

Without changing the URL, the warning comes up fine. Also, if you change the relative link to only point to `#go`, the warning comes up fine.

Do we check for the URL/document that requested fullscreen and that actually enters fullscreen somewhere?

I wonder if the websocket connection breaks bfcache, and that causes us to create a different windowglobal, and that probably affects the fullscreen actor. Nika, do you know whether websockets break bfcache and whether this is plausible?

Off the top of my head, I think that an active WebSocket connection would disable bfcache, yeah. You can check if this is caused by that change in behaviour by removing the websocket connection, and instead adding an "unload" event listener on the document, which should also suppress bfcache.

Using `window.addEventListener("unload", console.log)` instead of the web socket seems to work, too (ie causes the warning not to come up while the window still goes into fullscreen).

In the console it says "TypeError: Fullscreen request aborted" when the PoC reproduces successfully. Firefox is definitely getting confused due to the navigation.

I was able to come up with a new PoC which seems to be reliable on all platforms (Windows, Linux and MacOS), at least for me.

By the new Poc, I can reproduce the problem.

Actually, the symptom is FF don't leave the fullscreen normally.

At that time, "aActor.requestOrigin" is undefined.

<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/ab81b8552f4aa9696a2524f97fdfeb59d4dc31c1/browser/base/content/browser-fullScreenAndPointerLock.js#573>

From my experiments, the timing is a big factor.

I can reproduce the problem easily when the timeout is less than 15.

> setTimeout(x=>{location=window.URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([blobContent], { type: "text/html" }));},1);

It looks like Alphen was affected by the layoffs. :-(

I looked at this, but the patch that Alphen pushed to try didn't fix the issue for me.

From local logging, it appears the parent process actor gets a `DOMFullscreen:Request` message, and then we unload the document, and the next thing the parent actor hears is that the actor is being destroyed. Then the parent gets a `MozDOMFullscreen:Entered` event.

The warning is normally generated by the `MozDOMFullscreen:NewOrigin` event (forwarded to the parent by the child), which is never seen by either of the bits of frontend code involved (again, based on logging). It looks like it is dispatched asynchronously at <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/19c23d725f27d0989e4a60f36d64004cebb39736/dom/base/Document.cpp#13444-13449> . I *suspect* that it never fires or is never seen by frontend because presumably the original document is destroyed while the event is queued, and/or we decide we don't need to re-emit it when the document to which we navigate is same-origin.

Olli, does this seem like an accurate diagnosis (if you're not the right person, please forward the needinfo to whoever still knows about our fullscreen code...)? I'm pretty confused, because the code in the PoC invokes `document.body.requestFullscreen` and so I'd have expected that the document being unloaded would mean we would interrupt our entering into fullscreen and abort it using the relevant APIs from the child to the parent, given that the element in question is no longer going to be around... :-\

Can you elaborate on what you mean? The only warning I'm aware of is keyed off this event, it seems.

We could change what we use to show the warning, if that would help?

Steven has been looking into other fullscreen related issues recently and said he could help here. (thanks!)

<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=9177090> helps with the issue here (testing with <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=9169053>)

but I think there is another problematic case if parent gets "DOMFullscreen:Request" and then didDestroy is called, since at that point

this.\_fullscreenWindow is null, I think, and also window.document.documentElement.hasAttribute("inDOMFullscreen") returns false.

Attachment <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=9178482> should fix things as far as I can tell. Alphan's original patch that worked on linux went part of the way, but based on timing (which I found changed drastically between mac and linux) it wouldn't catch all cases. This patch does a lot more checking for actor's being destroyed before attempting to send a msg to transition the child to Fullscreen. I also needed to keep track in the parent when the msg had already been sent so that if the child died before it could reply we would still cleanup.

I have yet to test this on Windows, but I'm decently confident it will fix things based on my tracing/logging/testing of the pieces involved here.

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 83

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

* [Bug 1667113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113)

#### [#CVE-2020-26952: Out of memory handling of JITed, inlined functions could lead to a memory corruption](#CVE-2020-26952)

Reporter
Gary Kwong
Impact
high
##### Description

Incorrect bookkeeping of functions inlined during JIT compilation could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash when handling out-of-memory errors.

##### References

* [Bug 1667685](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667685)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1642028](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1642028)

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

* [Bug 1656741](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741)

#### [#CVE-2020-26954: Local spoofing of web manifests for arbitrary pages in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26954)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When accepting a malicious intent from other installed apps, Firefox for Android accepted manifests from arbitrary file paths and allowed declaring webapp manifests for other origins. This could be used to gain fullscreen access for UI spoofing and could also lead to cross-origin attacks on targeted websites.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1657026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1657026)

#### [#CVE-2020-26955: Cookies set during file downloads are shared between normal and Private Browsing Mode in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26955)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a user downloaded a file in Firefox for Android, if a cookie is set, it would have been re-sent during a subsequent file download operation on the same domain, regardless of whether the original and subsequent request were in private and non-private browsing modes.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1663261](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663261)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

##### References

* [Bug 1666300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300)

#### [#CVE-2020-26957: OneCRL was not working in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26957)

Reporter
Kevin Brosnan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

OneCRL was non-functional in the new Firefox for Android due to a missing service initialization. This could result in a failure to enforce some certificate revocations.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1667179](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667179)

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1669466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

* [Bug 1672223](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672223)

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

* [Bug 1672528](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672528)

#### [#CVE-2020-26962: Cross-origin iframes supported login autofill](#CVE-2020-26962)

Reporter
Paul Stone
Impact
low
##### Description

Cross-origin iframes that contained a login form could have been recognized by the login autofill service, and populated. This could have been used in clickjacking attacks, as well as be read across partitions in dynamic first party isolation.

#### [#CVE-2020-26963: History and Location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser](#CVE-2020-26963)

Reporter
Sachin Raste
Impact
low
##### Description

Repeated calls to the history and location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser. This was addressed by introducing rate-limiting to these API calls.

##### References

* [Bug 1314912](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1314912)

#### [#CVE-2020-26964: Firefox for Android's Remote Debugging via USB could have been abused by untrusted apps on older versions of Android](#CVE-2020-26964)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
low
##### Description

If the Remote Debugging via USB feature was enabled in Firefox for Android on an Android version prior to Android 6.0, untrusted apps could have connected to the feature and operated with the privileges of the browser to read and interact with web content. The feature was implemented as a unix domain socket, protected by the Android SELinux policy; however, SELinux was not enforced for versions prior to 6.0. This was fixed by removing the Remote Debugging via USB feature from affected devices.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1658865](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1658865)

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

##### References

* [Bug 1661617](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661617)

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1663571](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571)

#### [#CVE-2020-26967: Mutation Observers could break or confuse Firefox Screenshots feature](#CVE-2020-26967)

Reporter
Kaizer Soze
Impact
low
##### Description

When listening for page changes with a Mutation Observer, a malicious web page could confuse Firefox Screenshots into interacting with elements other than those that it injected into the page. This would lead to internal errors and unexpected behavior in the Screenshots code.

##### Description

Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Byron Campen, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 78.5

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 78.5

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Thunderbird's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Thunderbird did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Thunderbird this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26968: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 78.5](#CVE-2020-26968)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Steve Fink, Jason Kratzer, Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
