{
  "cveId": "CVE-2020-26956",
  "description": "In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the HTML sanitization process. When sanitizing HTML content during a paste operation, the process removes certain HTML elements but fails to remove associated event handlers, specifically within SVG elements.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The HTML sanitizer does not remove event handlers when removing elements."
    ],
    "impact": "This leads to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable application. This could lead to stealing user credentials, redirecting to malicious sites, or other malicious activities.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "The attack vector involves pasting specially crafted HTML containing SVG elements with malicious event handlers, using manual paste or the Clipboard API."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to copy and paste HTML content into a vulnerable area of the application that uses the sanitizer. No other specific capabilities or privileges are required."
  },
  "affectedSoftware": [
    {
      "name": "Firefox",
      "versions": "All versions prior to the fix"
    }
  ],
  "timeline": {
    "discovery": "The vulnerability was discovered by Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7) while fuzzing Firefox's clipboard API content sanitization on pasting.",
    "fix": "The vulnerability was fixed by removing attributes from descendants when setting sanitized style and parsing into an inert document."
