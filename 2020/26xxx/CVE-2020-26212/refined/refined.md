Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an improper access control implementation within the CalDAV server of GLPI, specifically in how it handles permissions for accessing calendar data. The issue is that authenticated users are granted read-only access to all CalDAV calendars, regardless of their actual permissions or group memberships.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper access control checks in the CalDAV implementation. This allows authenticated users to bypass intended restrictions and gain unauthorized access to other users' and groups' calendar data.
*   **Incorrect Permission Checks**: The code does not correctly verify user permissions when accessing CalDAV calendars leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Exposure:** Any authenticated user can read calendar entries of other users, including administrators, and groups, even those they are not supposed to have access to. This exposure reveals sensitive planning information, potentially impacting personal privacy and organizational security.
*   **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive planning information can be accessed by unauthorized personnel.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality**: Calendar data meant to be private is made accessible to a broad user base.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CalDAV Client Access:** The vulnerability is exploited by using a CalDAV client (e.g., Thunderbird) to connect to the server with a valid user account to access the calendars of other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Credentials:** An attacker needs to have a valid user account on the GLPI instance in order to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to connect to the GLPI server's CalDAV endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue is specific to the CalDAV component of GLPI.
*   The vulnerability is considered to be of "Moderate" severity.
*   The provided commit ([5272803](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/commit/527280358ec78988ac57e9809d2eb21fcd74caf7)) fixes the issue.
*   A workaround is to remove the `caldav.php` file which disables the CalDAV server and prevents exploitation.
