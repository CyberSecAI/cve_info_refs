| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355#c0)• 4 years ago |
|  | |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/85.0.4183.121 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

* Set up a simple web server that responds to /aaa.csv with a csv file (content-type: text/csv)
* Create an HTML page containing <script src='/aaa.csv'></script>
* FF will pop an error (in console) saying "The resource from '/aaa.csv' was blocked due to MIME type (“text/csv”) mismatch". (that's the desired behavior)

In order to bypass this restriction, set up a service worker "proxy" layer. It will serve the content from a local cache. FF will execute the fetched content (despite the content-type which isn't application/javascript) This effectively opens up a class of vulnerabilities, the most notable that comes to my mind is XSSI (Cross Site Script Inclusion).

HTML Code:

<html><body>

<script>navigator.serviceWorker.register('sw.js');</script>

<script src='/intercept'></script>

</body></html>

---

SW Code:

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {

const url = '<http://localhost:8081/aaaafffa.csv?11>';

if(event.request.url.endsWith('/intercept'))

event.respondWith(

caches.match(event.request)

.then((response) => response ||

fetch(url, {

method : 'GET',

mode : 'no-cors',

credentials: 'include',

headers : {'Content-type':'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}

})

)

.catch(() => caches.match('offline')),

);

});

Actual results:

JavaScript execution is possible - bypassing script inclusion security restrictions. (This allows a set of XSSI attacks)

Expected results:

JavaScript execution should be blocked due to mismatching MIME type

The tl;dr is that nsHttpChannel the security checks that should happen happen in nsHttpChannel and are contingent on the "destination" of the fetch being script-like. Because ServiceWorker interception is its own channel type that inherits from HttpBaseChannel, not nsHttpChannel, the intercepted subresource request is not subject to the check. However, if the intercepted FetchEvent's Request instance is passed to fetch() to actually go to the network, the destination will be propagated and the checks will be applied. So in the case of a naive pass-through ServiceWorker or naive caching ServiceWorker, the checks remain in effect.

:valentin (and cc :dragana), do you have thoughts on whether the check logic should be pushed into the HttpBaseChannel common class?

### Detailed Analysis

Based on my understanding of what's going on:

* In the normal window ScriptLoader situation described in the bug:
  + An HTTP channel is created with an internal load type of nsIContentPolicy::TYPE\_INTERNAL\_SCRIPT which corresponds to an external content policy of nsIContentPolicy::TYPE\_SCRIPT and also corresponds to a fetch destination of "script" which is `RequestDestination::Script` for our purposes.
  + nsHttpChannel is responsible for doing any appropriate MIME type checks. In both cases, the check is dependent on the destination of the script.
    1. The "nosniff" case, [fetch 3.4.1](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#should-response-to-request-be-blocked-due-to-nosniff?) seems to be what's being reported here based on the [error message](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/35245411b9e8a911fe3f5adb0632c3394f8b4ccb/dom/locales/en-US/chrome/security/security.properties#79) matching the [nsHttpChannel nosniff check logic](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpChannel.cpp#1590-1599). This depends on the server returning a header of `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
    2. The other check is [fetch 2.9](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#should-response-to-request-be-blocked-due-to-mime-type?) which is implemented by [EnsureMIMEOfScript](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/35245411b9e8a911fe3f5adb0632c3394f8b4ccb/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpChannel.cpp#1615)
* In the Firefox ServiceWorker case:
  + The fetch being issued from the ServiceWorker has no explicit destination so it gets a destination of "" which doesn't induce the check.
  + A naive pass-through `fetch(event.request)` would have the destination and the check would be maintained.
* From a spec perspective:
  + We have the script-loader initiated fetch which will be intercepted in step 3.1 of [4.3 HTTP fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-fetch) by "handle fetch". This will have been called either indirectly by [4.2 Scheme Fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#scheme-fetch) or directly by [4.1 Main Fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#main-fetch) but either way it's in step 5.
  + Both the [nosniff](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#should-response-to-request-be-blocked-due-to-nosniff?) and [due to its MIME type](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#should-response-to-request-be-blocked-due-to-mime-type?) spec checks happen in step 12 of [4.1 Main fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#main-fetch) which gets to consume the results of step 5.

This behavior shouldn't have changed with the introduction of parent intercept.

I think that makes sense., and it's the thing we usually do when we discover some properties of nsHttpChannel also apply to other types of channels 🙂

> Christoph: what other DOM: Security type checks might get bypassed in this path?

I did an anlysis of nsHTTPChannel and ultimately we should move the following security mechanisms from `nsHttpChannel::CallOnStartRequest` in the base channel implementation:

* `EnsureMIMEOfScript` including the `WarnWrongMIMEOfScript`, and
* `ProcessXCTO` which enfoces `x-content-type-options nosniff.

I am not entirely sure about the actual mime type sniffing code surrounded by `if (mLoadFlags & LOAD_CALL_CONTENT_SNIFFERS) {`, that probably needs to be evaluated again, but i could imagine that we want to move that as well.

Per <https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/processes/security-approval.html#on-requesting-sec-approval> and because this is sec-moderate, I am planning to land the fix (not the tests) after the soft freeze ends and to request beta uplift after letting it bake for a few days on nightly. If there's something else I should do, please let me know.

The test that failed was actually incorrect: it had a service worker returning scripts without the `Content-Type` header, so with the patch it failed. Once I added the correct MIME type the test passes. Fixing the test in the same patch as the actual fix might tip off observers about this issue, so I'm not sure what the best course of action here would be. Maybe fix the test in a separate patch?

Thanks for the quick investigation! Yes, that sounds good! If you want to file a bug for that and put the patch up, I can review that quickly. Setting needinfo because I find it more helpful with secbugs.

You mean like we should add a test that scripts lacking the correct MIME type are rejected? That's covered by the enhanced test on this bug (that we can't land yet).

Looks like this grafts cleanly to Beta as-landed. Does this also affect ESR78? If we wanted to uplift there, it'd need a bit of rebasing, however.

This affects ESR78, yes. (If only we'd disabled ServiceWorkers on ESR again![1] ;) I think it would make sense to let it bake for a little more to make sure there's no obvious real-world fallout from this, but it does seem desirable to have the spec-correct behavior on ESR78. :ytausky, do you have cycles to do the rebase and check that the (un-landed) test from this bug passes with the rebased fix applied?

Any uplift will also need to take the fix from <https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D94902> for <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1673748> which is where :ytausky fixed the test that was unhappy and caused this to get backed out the first time. (We landed that separately because otherwise it rather does draw a lot of attention to what's changing, despite this just being sec-med.)

1: This is a joke whose context is that we disabled ServiceWorkers on ESR repeatedly because

The patch landed in nightly and beta is affected.

:asuth, is this bug important enough to require an uplift?

If not please set `status_beta` to `wontfix`.

# Introduction

While fuzzing ContentParent IPC with a slightly modified harness, I came across a very weird crash. Crash happens during xpcom shutdown, possibly due to refcounting a freed instance via a stale pointer.

# Steps

Used fuzzfetch to get latest release fuzzing build to reproduce on stock harness.

```
$ ./m-r-20201005120340-fuzzing-asan-opt/firefox latest-stock-85713

# Speculative Root Cause

Ref counting on a stale reference to `WebRequestService` object during xpcom shutdown. I am not sure if this can be reproduced in a running browser instance and not just the fuzzing harness.

maybe sec-moderate in the worst case? I think the extension process would only shut down at browser shut down which doesn't seem very useful even if this does happen to be exploitable.

It looks that the WebRequestService RefPtr is initially created by a call to `ContentParent::RecvInitStreamFilter` released, after that point no additional references are added to that RefPtr because we are just returning a reference to the `*sWeakWebRequestService`.

When the FuzzerDriver.cpp is exiting here: <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/c2e3ac11be4837718c2604e58085fbc8252b69dd/tools/fuzzing/libfuzzer/FuzzerDriver.cpp#812>, the last reference to the WebRequestService RefPtr is released and right after that the WebRequestService destructor is executed.

The use after free seems to be triggered while executing NS\_ShutdownXPCOM, which is due to ClearOnShutdown:

* in WebRequestService::GetSingleton we are passing to ClearOnshutdown the pointer to the same RefPtr that has been released when the FuzzerDriver.cpp does exit): <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/c2e3ac11be4837718c2604e58085fbc8252b69dd/toolkit/components/extensions/webrequest/WebRequestService.cpp#24>

I have the feeling that this may not be something that would happen outside of the fuzzing harness, I would expect NS\_ShutdownXPCOM to be called before exiting the process in a regular browser instance not running under the fuzzing harness.

Hi Christian Holler (or Tyson or tunnelshade),

does the rationale in [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap use-after-free via ContentParent::RecvInitStreamFilter") make sense from your perspective?

we'll wait your confirmation before setting a severity and priority on this issue.

Besides that, is it possible to reproduce this issue locally? (e.g. is there a doc page to provide guidance on reproducing fuzzing tests locally?)

Yes, this is very much possible and we had similar problems with the ContentParentIPC and other IPC fuzzing targets before.

We do register an at-exit handler because of that `exit` call in libFuzzer here:

<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/819be4899a92213abf121b449779ced662f2ce13/tools/fuzzing/interface/harness/FuzzerRunner.cpp#46>

Do you think that `DeinitXPCOM` method needs a call to `NS_ShutdownXPCOM` ?

Unfortunately I'm not really that much experienced on how xpcom shutdown sequence, and so I should definitely like to double-check it with something that has more direct knowledge about those pieces, but in the meantime I took a look to get an initial picture and if I'm not reading it wrong I think that `DeinitXPCOM` should be already calling `NS_ShutdownXPCOM`.

Would you mind to double-check if any of the following details are not right?

* the ScopedXPCOM class used by InitLibFuzzer is the one defined in FuzzerTestHarness.h here: <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/61728de8273c04fe2417c475fc0637e8b79210d7/tools/fuzzing/interface/harness/FuzzerTestHarness.h#59>
* at-exit FuzzerRunner.cpp calls DeinitXPCOM, which does call InitLibFuzzer.DeinitXPCOM()
* InitLibFuzzer.DeinitXPCOM() does then destroy the ScopedXPCOM instance, which will invoke its destructor
* The FuzzerTestHarness.h's ScopedXPCOM destructor should already be calling NS\_ShutdownXPCOM here: <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/61728de8273c04fe2417c475fc0637e8b79210d7/tools/fuzzing/interface/harness/FuzzerTestHarness.h#106>
* and NS\_ShutdownXPCOM should be executing all the ClearOnShutdown's pointers added to the `sShutdownObservers` list of shutdown observers here: <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/61728de8273c04fe2417c475fc0637e8b79210d7/xpcom/build/XPCOMInit.cpp#656-660>

I did want to also double-check if the pernosco trace linked in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap use-after-free via ContentParent::RecvInitStreamFilter") does confirm that the sequence described above is actually consistent with what is really happening during the fuzzy test shutdown, but I couldn't load successfully the Pernosco trace (I already asked in the Pernosco support channel about the issue I'm having on loading this trace, but I'll try to take another look if I can get access to the trace again).

The pernosco trace linked in [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap use-after-free via ContentParent::RecvInitStreamFilter") has been restored and so I did take another look:

* the sequence described in [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap use-after-free via ContentParent::RecvInitStreamFilter") looks about right: `FuzzerRunner` is definitely calling `NS_ShutdownXPCOM` (and it does call `ClearOnShutdown` as expected, and this is actually where we are triggering the use after free when the fuzz test is exiting).
* the only RefPtr<WebRequestService> reference has got added by the following call stack:

```
fuzzer::FuzzerDriver () at FuzzerDriver.cpp:802
fuzzer::RunOneTest () at FuzzerDriver.cpp:301
  ::Fuzzer::ExecuteCallback () at FuzzerLoop.cpp:562
RunContentParentIPCFuzzing () at content_parent_ipc_libfuzz.cpp:27
mozilla::ipc::FuzzProtocol<> () at ProtocolFuzzer.h:99
  ::PContentParent::OnMessageReceived () at PContentParent.cpp:7978
  ::ContentParent::RecvInitStreamFilter () at ContentParent.cpp:4041
  ::StreamFilterParent::Create () at StreamFilterParent.cpp:116
  ::WebRequestService::GetSingleton () at WebRequestService.cpp:23

```

* `FuzzerDriver` call does exit before `FuzzerRunner` and so the `NS_ShutdownXPCOM` call from the `FuzzerRunner`'s exit handler is being called after the `FuzzerDriver` exit handlers did already release the last (and only) reference to the `RefPtr<WebRequestService>` reference

I did also take a look to the reasons behind that [`static WebRequestService* sWeakWebRequestService`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/61728de8273c04fe2417c475fc0637e8b79210d7/toolkit/components/extensions/webrequest/WebRequestService.cpp#16):

It seems also something to take into account if we do plan to make changes to WebRequestService (in particular to make sure we don't reintroduce the issue that was tracked by [Bug 1396652](/show_bug.cgi?id=1396652 "VERIFIED FIXED - Intermittent toolkit/components/extensions/test/mochitest/test_ext_xhr_capabilities.html | application crashed [@ WebRequestService::ChannelParent::Detach()]")).

Looking into other places in mozilla-central where we are using `ClearOnShutdown`, [as well as looking to the inline comment right above ClearOnShutdown definition here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/61728de8273c04fe2417c475fc0637e8b79210d7/xpcom/base/ClearOnShutdown.h#34-39):

I'm wondering if `static RefPtr<WebRequestService> instance` should actually be changed to `static StaticRefPtr<WebRequestService> instance` (e..g. similarly to what we are doing in [dom/indexedDB/ActorsParentCommon.cpp here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/61728de8273c04fe2417c475fc0637e8b79210d7/dom/indexedDB/ActorsParentCommon.cpp#139-144)), but that is something to double-check (if it would be technically correct and if it would make any actual difference for the issue triggered by the fuzzer test harness) with someone that does have more direct knowledge than me about `CleanOnShutdown` and `StaticRefPtr`, before make any actual plan to make any change to that.

Looking to the mercurial logs maybe :glandium would be able to help on double-checking that.

100% `static RefPtr<>` is not good. We had a discussion recently with Nika about these sort of things. It would seem like we really should do some static analysis on this pattern, because that's not the only place where this is happening.

That said, with a combination of `static StaticRefPtr` and `ClearOnShutdown`, I would still expect things to be able to go wrong. In fact, as far as destructors are concerned, `static RefPtr` shouldn't be different from `static StaticRefPtr` given we don't unload libxul anymore.

Honestly I'm not sure if this can be really (and easily) triggered in a real browser instance and be easily exploitable (I also tried to reproduce it with a small gtest and I wasn't able to trigger it).

I fixed it sooner rather than later mainly because I think that this issue may prevent the fuzzy tests to be able to catch other potential issues (because if this one is triggered the run crash and may miss other ones), and for that I guess that having it on Nightly may be enough.

Nevertheless, (after it did bake a bit on Nightly) I would not be against to uplift it if we want to, the risk of regressions should be low.

Let's see what is :dveditz opinion about uplifting it.

Given the simple fix, that equally clearly announces which object gets prematurely freed, it would be safer to uplift this than not.

[Bug 1669466](/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap use-after-free via ContentParent::RecvInitStreamFilter") - Change WebRequestService singleton to a StaticRefPtr. r=glandium!,mixedpuppy!

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: Security expressed in favor of uplifting it (See <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466#c22>)
* **User impact if declined**: The issue to be leveraged for an exploit (if that turns out to be doable).
* **Fix Landed on Version**: 84
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: risk set to low for the following reasons:

* the actual change is small and trivial (and the code changed and the directly surrounding code didn't change much from the version in Firefox 78, the context and rationale for the change as described in the phabricator comments do also apply unchanged to Firefox 78)
* all the existing tests does pass successfully
* verified fuzzy test failure is fixed on a local build
* the fix did bake on nightly a bit (and we are not aware of any new issue related to this been reported on bugzilla so far)

* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**:

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 78.5

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 78.5

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

##### References

* [Bug 1667113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

##### References

* [Bug 1656741](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

##### References

* [Bug 1666300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300)

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1669466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

* [Bug 1661617](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661617)

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Steve Fink, Jason Kratzer, Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
low
##### Description

If the Remote Debugging via USB feature was enabled in Firefox for Android on an Android version prior to Android 6.0, untrusted apps could have connected to the feature and operated with the privileges of the browser to read and interact with web content. The feature was implemented as a unix domain socket, protected by the Android SELinux policy; however, SELinux was not enforced for versions prior to 6.0. This was fixed by removing the Remote Debugging via USB feature from affected devices.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Thunderbird's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.
