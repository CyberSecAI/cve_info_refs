Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26959:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability occurring during browser shutdown. The `WebRequestService` object, a singleton, is managed by a `RefPtr`. The vulnerability arises because the `RefPtr` is released before the `ClearOnShutdown` mechanism attempts to access it, leading to a use-after-free. Specifically the `WebRequestService` RefPtr is created in `ContentParent::RecvInitStreamFilter` and released when FuzzerDriver exits. However, the `ClearOnShutdown` is called after FuzzerDriver exits during `NS_ShutdownXPCOM`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free, where a pointer is used after the memory it points to has been freed. This occurs in the `WebRequestService` during the shutdown process.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The use-after-free leads to memory corruption.
- **Potential for Exploitable Crash:** The memory corruption can result in an exploitable crash. Although the provided details suggest that this specific UAF is not easily exploitable in non-fuzzing scenarios, the memory corruption introduces the possibility of code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Fuzzing:** The vulnerability was initially discovered and reproduced using a fuzzing harness, specifically targeting the `ContentParent` IPC.
- **WebExtension:** The vulnerability exists in the web extension request handling logic, making it a target for attacks involving web extensions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker would need to somehow trigger the specific sequence of events that leads to the use-after-free during shutdown.
- This vulnerability is more easily triggered within the fuzzing environment, but the potential exists in the browser during shutdown.
- The attacker needs to be able to make use of the `WebRequestService` and control when it's released

**Additional notes:**

*   The bug report mentions that `static RefPtr<>` is not suitable and that `StaticRefPtr` should be used in this case with `ClearOnShutdown` mechanism.
*   The fix implemented changes the `RefPtr` to a `StaticRefPtr` for `WebRequestService` singleton.
*   The fix was applied to Firefox 83, Firefox ESR 78.5 and Thunderbird 78.5.
*   The vulnerability is considered moderate severity, according to the included advisory, though initially it was suggested it might not be exploitable outside of fuzzing scenarios.
*   The bug report details that the `WebRequestService` RefPtr is released during the `FuzzerDriver` exit, while the `ClearOnShutdown` is called after it during `NS_ShutdownXPCOM`, leading to the use-after-free.
