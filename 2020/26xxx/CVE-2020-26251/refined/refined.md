    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy in Open Zaak was configured to allow access from any origin (`CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS=True`), instead of a specific list of trusted origins. This was intended only for development machines running on localhost/127.0.0.1.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper CORS configuration: The application was configured to allow cross-origin requests from any domain.",
          "CORS was enabled when it should have been disabled by default. This exposed the application to potential CSRF."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially run scripts on their own website (evil.com) that perform AJAX calls to Open Zaak installations, and the browser would not block them. This could lead to unauthorized actions or data access if other security measures were not in place.",
      "attack_vectors": "Cross-origin requests initiated from a malicious website.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a website and have a victim access that website with a browser."
