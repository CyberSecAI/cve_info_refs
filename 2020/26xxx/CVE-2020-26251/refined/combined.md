# CORS configuration is possibly vulnerable

Low

[sergei-maertens](/sergei-maertens)
published
GHSA-chhr-gxrg-64x7
Dec 17, 2020

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 1.3.3

## Patched versions

1.3.3

## Description

### Impact

The Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing policy in Open Zaak is currently wide open - every client is allowed.

This allows evil.com to run scripts that perform AJAX calls to known Open Zaak installations, and the browser will not block these. This was intended to only apply to development machines running on localhost/127.0.0.1.

### Patches

Open Zaak 1.3.3 disables CORS by default, while it can be opted-in through environment variables.

### Workarounds

The vulnerability does not actually seem exploitable because:

* The session cookie has a `Same-Site: Lax` policy which prevents it from being sent along in Cross-Origin requests
* All pages that give access to (production) data are login-protected
* `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is set to `false`
* CSRF checks probably block the remote origin, since they're not explicitly added to the trusted allowlist.

### References

* MDN on CORS: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS>
* library used: <https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/>

### For more information

Deze repository bevat broncode en documentatie voor productiewaardige API's voor Zaakgericht Werken (ZGW). Deze API's volgen de standaard van VNG Realisatie "API's voor Zaakgericht Werken".

## Zaakgericht Werken

Zaakgericht werken is een vorm van procesgericht werken die door de Nederlandse gemeenten, en steeds meer landelijke overheden, wordt toegepast om verzoeken van burgers en bedrijven te behandelen. De zaak staat hierbij centraal. Een zaak is een samenhangende hoeveelheid werk met een gedefinieerde aanleiding en een gedefinieerd resultaat waarvan kwaliteit en doorlooptijd bewaakt moeten worden. De API's voor Zaakgericht Werken ondersteunen de registratie van alle metadata en gegevens die komen kijken bij Zaakgericht Werken. Zie ook [Zaakgericht werken in het gemeentelijk gegevenslandschap](https://www.gemmaonline.nl/images/gemmaonline/f/f6/20190620_-_Zaakgericht_werken_in_het_Gemeentelijk_Gegevenslandschap_v101.pdf).

## Standaard "API's voor Zaakgericht Werken"

In het kader van Common Ground heeft VNG Realisatie deze standaard ontwikkeld. Daarbij zijn tegelijk met API-specificaties referentie-implementaties gerealiseerd om aan te tonen dat de specificaties in software kunnen worden geïmplementeerd. De volgende inhoudelijke API's maken onderdeel uit van de standaard:

* Catalogi - voor de registratie van zaaktype-catalogi, zaaktype en alle daarbij horende typen.
* Zaken - voor de registratie van zaken. Zaken kunnen o.a. relaties hebben met documenten, besluiten, contacten. De API biedt functionaliteit voor audit trail en archiveren.
* Documenten - voor de registratie van informatieobjecten, hetgeen zowel documenten als andere informatiedragers zoals foto's en film kunnen zijn.
* Besluiten - voor de registratie van besluiten die in het kader van zaakgericht werken worden genomen.

Daarnaast zijn er een paar generieke API's die nodig om gebruik te maken van deze API's:

* Notificaties - in Common Ground worden gegevens bij de bron geregistreerd en bijgehouden. Consumers krijgen niet vanzelf bericht als er iets is gewijzigd. Hiervoor kunnen ze een abonnement registreren bij de Notificaties API.
* Autorisaties - via de Autorisaties API wordt de toegang van applicaties tot gegevens geregeld.

## Productiewaardige API's

Bij de realisatie van productiewaardige API's is aandacht besteed aan een aantal belangrijke aspecten:

* Beheer: er is een beheerportaal ingericht waarmee de verschillende API's door functioneel beheerders kunnen worden beheerd.
* Performance: er zijn performance-metingen verricht op basis van schattingen van de verwachte belasting door applicaties die eindgebruikers gebruiken. Benodigde verbeteringen zijn doorgevoerd waardoor een belasting door 2000 eindgebruikers geen problemen zou moeten opleveren.
* Documentatie van de componenten, met name van de beheer applicaties. (De inhoudelijke documentatie over de API's is onderdeel van de standaard.)
* Uitrol: Om de uitrol naar servers te vereenvoudigen is er een Docker container beschikbaar. Dit zijn een soort componenten die gemakkelijk kunnen worden uitgerold op een server om ze vervolgens in gebruik te nemen. Hiermee kunnen gemeenten de API’s op eenvoudige wijze (laten) draaien bij een hostingpartij.

## Architectuur van Open Zaak

De architectuur van Open Zaak is gebaseerd op een beperkt aantal componenten. De belangrijkste component is de registratiecomponent die de API's voor ZGW aanbiedt. Daarnaast zijn er de volgende componenten:

* Notificatie-component, noodzakelijk voor de werking van Open Zaak.
* Selectielijst component die wordt gebruikt om de VNG Selectielijst voor archiveren te ontsluiten
* Beheerportaal dat toegang biedt tot de verschillende beheerapps die bij de API's horen

[![Open-Zaak Componenten-overzicht](/open-zaak/open-zaak/raw/main/docs/introduction/_assets/architecture.png)](/open-zaak/open-zaak/blob/main/docs/introduction/_assets/architecture.png)

## Implementatie

Deze repository bevat de broncode voor de API's. Om gebruik te kunnen maken van de API's moeten deze ergens gehost worden als een service. Als onderdeel van de ontwikkelstraat worden bij elke nieuwe versie van Open Zaak een Docker container die direct kunnen worden uitgerold in een Kubernetes cluster.

## Bouw

Deze API's zijn ontwikkeld door [Maykin Media B.V.](https://www.maykinmedia.nl) in opdracht van Amsterdam,
Rotterdam, Utrecht, Tilburg, Arnhem, Haarlem, 's-Hertogenbosch, Delft en een coalitie
van Hoorn, Medemblik, Stede Broec, Drechteland, Enkhuizen (SED), onder regie van [Dimpact](https://www.dimpact.nl).

# Changelog

## 1.17.0 (2025-01-17)

**New features**

* [[open-zaak/open-notificaties#156](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-notificaties/issues/156)] Define kenmerk for Zaak.zaaktype.catalogus

Warning

In order to use this new kenmerk, Open Notificaties must be updated to version 1.x.x (TBD)
and the `src/manage.py register_kanalen` command must be run in Open Zaak to update
the `zaken` kanaal with this new kenmerk

Warning

If you are using `django-setup-configuration` to configure Open Zaak and Open Notificaties,
make sure to add `zaaktype.catalogus` to the filters of the `zaken` kanaal in `notifications_kanalen_config`.

* [#1815] Allow files bigger than 2GB

**Bugfixes and QOL**

* [#1802] fix `CELERY_LOGLEVEL` not working

Warning

`LOG_STDOUT` configuration variable now defaults to `True` instead of `False`

* [[maykinmedia/open-api-framework#66](https://github.com/maykinmedia/open-api-framework/issues/66)] updated commonground-api-common to 2.1.0
* [[maykinmedia/open-api-framework#66](https://github.com/maykinmedia/open-api-framework/issues/66)] updated zgw-consumers to 0.35.1
* [#1830] Fix ZIO.informatieobject filter with external doc with the same host

Warning

Configuring external services is now done through the Service model. This
replaces the APICredential model in the admin interface. A data migration
was added to move to the Service model. It is advised to verify the Service
instances in the admin to check that the data migration was ran as expected.

Additionally, it is advised to check the Selectielijstconfiguratie to see if a service
is configured for it.

**Project maintenance**

* [[maykinmedia/open-api-framework#93](https://github.com/maykinmedia/open-api-framework/issues/93)] install security updates for dependencies
* [[maykinmedia/objects-api#463](https://github.com/maykinmedia/objects-api/issues/463)] Add trivy image scan
* [[maykinmedia/open-api-framework#81](https://github.com/maykinmedia/open-api-framework/issues/81)] change to UV compile

  >   if it does not initially succeed
  > + The amount of retries and exponential backoff parameters can be configured in the
  >   admin
  > + Notification publishing is now async, which requires deploying background task

Warning

Deployment tooling updates required - additional containers needed.

The publishing of notifications by Open Zaak to the Notifications API is now done
via a task queue and background workers. You need to update your deployment tooling
to start (and monitor) these background workers.

An example docker-compose entry (taken from our `docker-compose.yml` in
github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak):

```
# existing containers
# ...

# new container
services:
  celery:
    image: openzaak/open-zaak:latest
    environment: *app-env
    command: /celery_worker.sh
    volumes: *app-volumes
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
```

Warning

Manual intervention required for ADFS/AAD users.

In Open Zaak 1.7.x we replaced the ADFS/Azure AD integration with the generic OIDC
integration. If you are upgrading from an older version, you must first upgrade to
the 1.7.x release series before upgrading to 1.8, and follow the manual intervention
steps in the 1.7 release notes.

After upgrading to 1.8, you can clean up the ADFS database entries by executing the
`bin/uninstall_adfs.sh` script on your infrastructure.

```
.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: single-server

    .. code-block:: bash

        docker exec openzaak-0 ./bin/uninstall_adfs.sh

Warning

Manual intervention required for ADFS/AAD users.

Open Zaak replaces the ADFS/Azure AD integration with the generic OIDC integration.
On update, Open Zaak will attempt to automatically migrate your ADFS configuration,
but this may fail for a number of reasons.

We advise you to:

* back up/write down the ADFS configuration BEFORE updating
* verify the OIDC configuration after updating and correct if needed

Additionally, on the ADFS/Azure AD side of things, you must update the Redirect URIs:
`https://open-zaak.gemeente.nl/adfs/callback` becomes
`https://open-zaak.gemeente.nl/oidc/callback`.

In release 1.8.0 you will be able to finalize the removal by dropping the relevant
tables.

* Removed Kubernetes cluster infrastructure code/playbooks/manifests - this is not the
  scope of Open Zaak (#854)
* Updated CI/test dependencies (#1098)
* Fixed Docker Hub and docs badges

Warning

Manual intervention(s) required!

**Admin panel brute-force protection**

Due to the ugprade of a number of dependencies, there is a new environment variable
`NUM_PROXIES` which defaults to `1` which covers a typical scenario of deploying
Open Zaak behind a single nginx reverse proxy. However, on Kubernetes there is
typically an nginx reverse proxy for file serving AND an ingress operating as reverse
proxy as well, requiring this configuration variable to be set to `2`. Other
deployment layouts/network topologies may also require tweaks.

Failing to specify the correct number may result in:

* login failures/brute-force attempts locking out your entire organization because one
  of the reverse proxies is now IP-banned - this happens if the number is too low.
* brute-force protection may not be operational because the brute-forcer can spoof
  their IP address, this happens if the number is too high.

Please review the documentation for more information about this configuration
parameter.

**Flush the caches**

Because of the Django 2.2 -> 3.2 upgrade in the dependencies, it's likely the
implementation details of the caches have an effect making old cached data
incompatible with the new Django version.

Therefore we recommend flushing the caches and let them rebuild automatically.

On the redis containers, you can do this by getting a shell in the container and
run the command:

```
redis-cli flushall
```

Warning

Manual intervention required!

Open Zaak 1.5.0+ corrected an oversight where the container was running as root. This
is no longer the case, the image from 1.5.0 and newer drops to an unprivileged user
with User ID 1000 and Group ID 1000.

The actions you need to take are documented explicitly in the 1.5
[:ref:`upgrade notes <installation\_reference\_1\_5\_upgrade>`](#id28). Please read these
before attempting the upgrade - we have documented them for the various platforms
and deployment strategies.

## 1.4.0 (2021-04-30)

**New features**

* Updated ADFS-integration support, now Azure AD is properly supported
* Allow selection of internal zaaktypen for related zaaktypen with user friendly
  picker (#910)

* Fixed broken zaaktype export for published zaaktypen (#964)

**Deployment tooling / infrastructure**

* Added configuration parameter to opt-in to use `X-Forwarded-Host` headers to
  determine the canonical domain of a request to Open Zaak. This is particularly useful
  when using Istio sidecars for example. (#916)
* Improved dependency management script
* Added CI check to detect improper version bumping
* Bumped version of Django Debug Toolbar to fix an SQL injection. Safe in production, as
  this dependency is not included in the published Docker images.

Warning

Manual intervention required

If you're upgrading from an *older* version than 1.2.0 of Open Zaak and using NLX,
you need to update to 1.3.5 first, and then update to the 1.4.x series.

In 1.2.0, the configuration of external API's was reworked, migrating from the
nlx-url-rewriter package to zgw-consumers. In 1.4.0, the nlx-url-rewriter package
is dropped and no longer present.

## 1.3.5 (2021-03-25)

1.3.5 is another release focused on bugfixes, performance and quality of life.

**Bugfixes**

* Bumped `cryptography` and `httplib2` versions, which had some vulnerabilities
  (#856, #858, #859)
* Fixed an issue where documents were considered external when the CMIS-adapter is
  enabled (#820)
* Various fixes focused on improving the CMIS-adapter performance (#900, #881, #895)

* Fixed incorrect and unexpected Autorisaties API behaviour for applications that are
  not "ready yet"

  > + applications must have either `heeftAlleAutorisaties` set or have `autorisaties`
  >   related to them (cfr. the standard)
  > + applications not satisfying this requirement are not visible in the API (for read,
  >   write or delete)
  > + applications not satisfying this requirement are flagged in the admin interface and
  >   can be filtered
  > + when (zaak)typen are deleted, they're related autorisaties are too. If this leads
  >   to an application without autorisaties, the application is also deleted as it is
  >   no longer valid
* Fixed serving files for download when using CMIS-adapter and dealing with `BytesIO`
  streams in general (#902)

**Deployment tooling / infrastructure**

* Uses new version of deployment tooling with podman support (alternative to Docker
  runtime)
* Fixed and improved configuration of the Notifications service in the
  `setup_configuration` management command. Generated credentials are now written
  to `stdout` and need to be used to configure Open Notificaties (or alternatives).

## 1.3.3 (2020-12-17)

Security and bugfix release

Warning

this release includes a security fix for [CVE-2020-26251](https://github.com/open-zaak/open-zaak/security/advisories/GHSA-chhr-gxrg-64x7), where Open Zaak
had a possible vulnerable CORS configuration. It is advised to update as soon as
possible. The severity is considered low, since we haven't been able to actually
exploit this due to mitigating additional security configuration in other aspects.

The bugfixes are mostly CMIS-adapter related.

**Bugfixes**

* The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration is now safe by default - no CORS is
  allowed. Environment configuration options are made available to make CORS possible
  to varying degrees, which are all opt-in. This fixes CVE-2020-26251.
* Fixed duplicate `ObjectInformatieObject` instances being created with CMIS enabled
  (#778)
* Fixed stale CMIS queryset cache preventing correct chained filtering (#782)
* Fixed some links being opened in new window/tab without `norel` or `noreferrer`
  set in the `rel` attribute
* Fixed multiple `EnkelvoudigInformatieobject` instances having the same
  `bronorganisatie` and `identificatie` (#768). If you're not using the CMIS-adapter,
  see the manual intervention required below.
* Fixed a bug retrieving `ObjectInformatieObject` collection in the Documenten API
  when CMIS is enabled. This may also have affected the `Gebruiksrechten` resource. (#791)

**Documentation**

* Improved documentation for CMIS services configuration
* Fixed a typo in the Governance document
* Documented environment variable to disable TLS certificate validation. This should
  never be used in production, instead the certificate setup should be fixed.

**Other changes**

* Enabled CMIS-adapter logging in DEBUG mode
* Migrated CI from Travis CI to Github Actions
* Explicitly test PostgreSQL versions 10, 11 and 12 (#716)
* Optimized CI build to re-use Docker image artifacts from previous jobs
* Replaced postman.io mocks subscription with nginx container (#790)
* Avoid some unnecessary queries when CMIS is enabled
* Implemented a (likely) fix to non-deterministic behaviour in the test suite (#798)

Warning

Manual intervention required.

There is a chance that documents have been created in the Documents API with
duplicate `(bronorganisatie, identificatie)` combinations.

We've provided a management command to check and fix these occurrences.

Run `python src/manage.py detect_duplicate_eio --help` in an Open Zaak container
to get the command line options. By default, the command is interactive:

```
.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: single-server

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ docker exec openzaak-0 src/manage.py detect_duplicate_eio
        Checking 30 records ...
        Found no duplicate records.

  .. group-tab:: Kubernetes

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ kubectl get pods
        NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
        cache-79455b996-jxk9r       1/1     Running   0          2d9h

        Checking 30 records ...
        Found no duplicate records.

```

## 1.3.2 (2020-11-09)

Open Zaak 1.3.2 fixes a number of issues discovered in 1.3.1. Note that there are two
manual interventions listed below these patch notes. Please read them before updating.

**Changes**

* Added messages in the admin if the selectielijst configuration is invalid (#698)
* Applied a unique constraint on user e-mail address (if provided) (#589) - see manual
  intervention warning below.
* Upgraded to a newer version of `zgw-consumers`, dropping the extra configuration
  field for services (#710)
* Implemented the upstream API bugfix, adding some zaken list query filters
  ([VNG-Realisatie/gemma-zaken#1686](https://github.com/VNG-Realisatie/gemma-zaken/issues/1686), #732)
* Added Github's code-scanning to detect vulnerable code patterns
* Updated frontend dependencies to secure versions
* Updated backend and deployment dependencies to secure versions (notably
  `cryptography`) (#755, #756)
* [CMIS-adapter] Changed `EnkelvoudigInformatieobject.identificatie` generation. CMIS
  query does not (always) support `LIKE` queries, nor does it support aggregation
  queries (#762)

**Bugfixes**

* Fixed #711 -- changed `Rol.omschrijving` max\_length from 20 -> 100
* Fixed input validation of binary document content (when the client forgets to base64
  encode it) (#608)
* Fixed primary keys being localized in admin URLs (#587)
* Fixed a crash when trying to download non-existant informatieobjecten (#584)
* Corrected validation of `Eigenschap.lengte`. API and admin are now consistent, and
  decimals are now correctly interpreted (comma instead of dot) (#685)
* Fixed the `register_kanaal` management command auth-issue (#738)
* Fixed a bug where deleted zaaktypen had dangling `Autorisatie` records (#713) - see
  manual intervention warning below.
* Updated to [CMIS adapter 1.1.1](https://github.com/open-zaak/cmis-adapter/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst) to fix some bugs (#760)

**Documentation**

* Update `Governance.md` after a number of steering group meetings
* Clarified that Ansible Galaxy roles and collections need to be installed separately
* Added a (technical) roadmap draft
* Drafted code style/code architecture principles
* Fixed a mix-up between authorizations/authentications API (#722)
* Docker image badge now points to Docker Hub
* Removed mention of Klantinteractie-API's - it's unclear what's being done with these
  API's
* Started documentation entries for developers of client/consumer applications

Warning

Manual intervention required.

E-mail addresses are used for logging in to the admin environment, which had no
unique constraint. This is corrected in a database migration, which will crash if
there are users with duplicate e-mail addresses. You should fix the duplicate
addresses **BEFORE** updating.

Warning

Manual intervention required.

Some cleanup is required because of a synchronization bug. You need to run
the following `sync_autorisaties` management command.

```
.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: single-server

    .. code-block:: bash

        docker exec openzaak-0 src/manage.py sync_autorisaties

  .. group-tab:: Kubernetes

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ kubectl get pods
        NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
        cache-79455b996-jxk9r       1/1     Running   0          2d9h
        nginx-8579d9dfbd-gdtbf      1/1     Running   0          2d9h
        nginx-8579d9dfbd-wz6wn      1/1     Running   0          2d9h
        openzaak-7b696c8fd5-hchbq   1/1     Running   0          2d9h
        openzaak-7b696c8fd5-kz2pb   1/1     Running   0          2d9h

        $ kubectl exec openzaak-7b696c8fd5-hchbq -- src/manage.py sync_autorisaties

```

specs!

* Included playbooks for NLX deployment
* Added communication channels to the docs (i.e. - how to find/contact us!)
* Added ADFS support (i.e. you can now log in to the admin with ADFS)
* Fixed some deployment tooling

## 1.0.4 (2020-03-05)

Improved support for integration with other APIs, most notably BAG/BRT APIs from the
kadaster (see <https://www.pdok.nl>). This increases the usability of ZaakObject relations.

* Added api-test.nl badge - proves that Open Zaak is compliant with the
  *API's voor zaakgericht werken* standard
* Added small documentation improvements
* Updated notification setup instructions
* Added support for API authentication with a simple *API key* (such as BAG or BRT)
* Added support for URL transformation so that data-fetching is forced over NLX

## 1.0.3 (2020-02-25)

|  |  |  |
|  |  | Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) |
|  |  | ==================================== |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Some clients develop against Open Zaak using single-page-application technology that |
|  |  | runs completely in the browser, such as React, Angular or other frameworks. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Open Zaak must be deployed with an appropriate CORS-configuration for this. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | .. note:: We always recommend using an API gateway/own backend to communicate with Open |
|  |  | Zaak. It's simpler because you don't have to deal with CORS, and there's less risk |
|  |  | of credentials/secrets leaking. You should \*\*never\*\* store client ID/secret in your |
|  |  | dist bundle(s). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Production-grade settings |
|  |  | ------------------------- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In production-like environments, we recommend using an explicit allow-list for the |
|  |  | trusted origins. This requires deploying Open Zaak with |
|  |  | ``CORS\_ALLOWED\_ORIGINS=https://my-app.example.com``, where ``https://my-app.example.com`` |
|  |  | is the domain where the application is deployed. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Development/experimental configuration |
|  |  | -------------------------------------- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If you're running Open Zaak locally or on an environment with dummy data for |
|  |  | development purposes, you can grant CORS access to every possible client using |
|  |  | ``CORS\_ALLOW\_ALL\_ORIGINS=True`` in the Open Zaak deployment. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Separation of administrative interface and API |
|  |  | ---------------------------------------------- |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The administrative interface authenticates using session cookies, while the APIs use |
|  |  | the ``Authorization`` header with bearer tokens. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The session cookies are never sent on cross-domain requests, and the CORS configuration |
|  |  | is configured to not allow credentials (which are typically session cookies). The API |
|  |  | with the ``Authorization`` header is not affected by this policy. |

|  |  |  |
|  |  | The following parameters control the CORS policy. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* `CORS\_ALLOW\_ALL\_ORIGINS`: allow cross-domain access from any client. Defaults to `False`. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* `CORS\_ALLOWED\_ORIGINS`: explicitly list the allowed origins for cross-domain requests. |
|  |  | Defaults to an empty list. Example: `http://localhost:3000,https://some-app.gemeente.nl`. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \* `CORS\_ALLOWED\_ORIGIN\_REGEXES`: same as `CORS\_ALLOWED\_ORIGINS`, but supports regular |

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing).

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.
