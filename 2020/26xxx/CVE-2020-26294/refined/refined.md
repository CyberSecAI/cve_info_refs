Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26294:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `env` and `expandenv` functions from the `Masterminds/sprig` library within Vela pipeline templates. These functions allow access to environment variables, which could include sensitive server configurations (e.g., `VELA_SOURCE_CLIENT`, `VELA_SECRET`) if not properly restricted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted Access to Environment Variables:** The pipeline template functionality did not prevent users from accessing environment variables.
- **Use of `env` and `expandenv` Functions:**  The `sprig` library functions `env` and `expandenv` were available in the template rendering context, allowing access to sensitive environment variables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Server Configuration:** Attackers could potentially leak sensitive server configurations by crafting a malicious pipeline template to expose these configurations.
- **Data Breach:** Exposed secrets, such as those related to server-worker communication or OAuth client IDs, could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Pipeline Templates:** Attackers could exploit this by crafting malicious Vela pipeline templates that use the `env` or `expandenv` function to print out the values of environment variables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create/Modify Pipeline Templates:** The attacker would need the ability to create or modify pipeline templates within the Vela system.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves removing the `env` and `expandenv` functions from the `sprig` template function map used when rendering pipeline templates, as demonstrated in the provided commit.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version `0.6.1` of the `go-vela/compiler` package.
- The provided github content includes the commit that fixes this vulnerability as well as a security advisory for the vulnerability
- The security advisory also recommends rotating secrets.
