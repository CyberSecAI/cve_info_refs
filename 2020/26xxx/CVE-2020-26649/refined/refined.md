{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `admin/dump.php` script in AtomXCMS-2 does not perform any input validation or sanitization on the `id` parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary file deletion vulnerability",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can delete any file on the server that the webserver has permissions to access, potentially leading to complete website compromise or denial of service by deleting essential configuration or data files. As stated by the report, a hacker can delete installed detection document.",
     "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `admin/dump.php` with the `ac=delete` parameter and specifying a file path in the `id` parameter, an attacker can trigger arbitrary file deletion.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the affected server, and must know or guess the path to the vulnerable `dump.php` file and the location of the file they wish to delete."
