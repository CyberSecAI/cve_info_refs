The provided content is related to a commit in the WordPress plugin "WP Courses LMS" which introduces options to enable or disable the REST API for courses, modules, lessons and teachers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit introduces options to control REST API access to course content, which were previously always enabled. The default setting disables REST API access for courses, modules, lessons, and teachers. If enabled, sensitive content that is supposed to be restricted via other means can be exposed through the REST API.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** If the REST API is enabled for Courses, Lessons, Modules or Teachers, content intended to be restricted or accessible to specific users can be accessed by anyone with access to the REST API endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized access to course content:** Users could bypass the normal content restriction mechanisms and access course materials, lessons, module information or teacher information without proper authorization.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct REST API requests:** An attacker would make direct requests to the REST API endpoints provided by the WordPress plugin when the "show_in_rest" parameter is set to true for these post types.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Basic knowledge of REST API usage:** An attacker needs to understand how to send HTTP requests to the appropriate REST API endpoints.
- **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the WordPress site.
- **No authentication is required:** If the REST API is enabled, no authentication would be necessary to access the content via the REST API endpoints.
