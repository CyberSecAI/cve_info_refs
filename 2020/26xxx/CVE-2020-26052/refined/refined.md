{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database, and it doesn't sanitize the data when it's retrieved and displayed on the web page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. This script will then be executed when other users access the affected pages, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the vulnerable input fields of the registration form.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to submit a registration form with malicious input. No special privileges required."
