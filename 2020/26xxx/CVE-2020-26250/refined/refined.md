Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26250:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly map the deprecated configuration option `c.Authenticator.whitelist` to the new configuration option `c.Authenticator.allowed_users` in `oauthenticator` when used with JupyterHub 1.2 and OAuthenticator versions 0.12.0-0.12.1. This resulted in the whitelist being ignored.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incorrect Handling of Deprecated Configuration:** The code failed to correctly map a deprecated configuration setting to its replacement.
-   **Authorization Bypass:** The primary weakness is that, when `c.Authenticator.whitelist` was used as the sole mechanism for restricting access, the misconfiguration allowed any authenticated user to gain access to the JupyterHub instance, bypassing intended restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Unauthorized Access:** If `c.Authenticator.whitelist` was the only restriction in place, any user who could authenticate with the configured authentication provider would be granted access.
-   **Data Exposure:** This vulnerability could lead to the exposure of sensitive data within the JupyterHub environment to unauthorized users.
-   **Resource Abuse:** Attackers could use the compromised access to abuse system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Configuration Misuse:** The attack vector is a configuration error: using the deprecated `c.Authenticator.whitelist` setting in `jupyterhub_config.py` with affected versions of `oauthenticator` and JupyterHub 1.2.
-   **Authentication Provider:**  Any valid account on the configured authentication provider (e.g., GitHub, Google) can be used to exploit this vulnerability, if no other authorization mechanisms are in place.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account with the authentication provider configured for JupyterHub.
-   **No other access controls:** The attacker only succeeds if no other access restrictions are configured (e.g. group/team restrictions).

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to `oauthenticator` versions 0.12.0 and 0.12.1 when used with JupyterHub 1.2.
*   The fix involves updating `oauthenticator` to version 0.12.2, or using `c.Authenticator.allowed_users` instead of `c.Authenticator.whitelist`.
*   The vulnerability was assigned the GitHub Security Advisory identifier **GHSA-384w-5v3f-q499**
*   The advisory provides workarounds, including modifying the `jupyterhub_config.py` configuration or using the `hub.extraConfig` setting in the JupyterHub Helm chart.
*   The content details how to properly configure `Authenticator.allowed_users` and `Authenticator.admin_users`.
* The fix was implemented in commit `a4aac191c16cf6281f3d346615aefa75702b02d7`
