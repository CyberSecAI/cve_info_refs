The provided content describes a vulnerability in Leostream Connection Broker version 8.2.37.0, which is not the specific version related to CVE-2020-26574. However, the provided content does offer useful vulnerability information.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input before being stored in the database and later displayed on the web platform. Specifically, the application saves data from HTTP headers, such as the User-Agent, without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User-controlled data is stored in the database without proper sanitization and later rendered on the web page, allowing for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Insecure URL Digest:** The URL protection mechanism relies on a digest generated from URL parameters, but the digest is not sufficiently strong and can be manipulated by using iframes.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly escape single quotes or other special characters when saving user-provided input into the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the stored XSS vulnerability and combining it with the ability to upload third-party components (webshells), attackers can achieve remote code execution on the server with root privileges.
*   **Full System Compromise:** As the vulnerable application runs with root privileges, an attacker can gain full control over the system.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** With root access, attackers can exfiltrate sensitive data, such as database credentials, user information, and other configurations.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Attackers could potentially use the compromised system as a pivot point to move laterally within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Header Injection:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript into the User-Agent header to trigger the stored XSS.
*   **Browser Manipulation:** Attackers use crafted HTML and JavaScript with iframes to manipulate the application workflow, bypass the URL digest protection, and upload malicious third-party components.
*   **Multipart Form Abuse:** Attackers craft specific multipart form requests to upload arbitrary Perl code that is then executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Leostream Connection Broker web interface.
*   **Basic HTTP/Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP, web requests, and HTML/JavaScript to craft the malicious payload.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The initial XSS vulnerability can be triggered without authentication, giving attackers an easy entry point.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The Leostream platform is built using Perl scripts.
*   Perl modules are encrypted with AES-256 in CBC mode, using a key derived with PBKDF2 and a hardcoded password.
*   The decryption process involves a custom "source filter" implemented in a shared object.
*   Attackers can reverse engineer the decryption process and decrypt the source code to understand how the application works.
*   The vulnerability was present in version 8.2.37.0, but may exist in other versions, although later versions use a different approach for encryption of the Perl Modules.
