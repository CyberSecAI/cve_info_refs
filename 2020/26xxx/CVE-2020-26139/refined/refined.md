Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-26139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in the handling of EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN) frames by certain Wi-Fi implementations, including Linux's mac80211 when operating in Access Point (AP) mode. Specifically, the AP forwards EAPOL frames from a client to other connected clients even if the sending client has not yet been successfully authenticated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication:** The AP forwards EAPOL frames from unauthenticated senders.
*   **EAPOL Forwarding:** The vulnerability stems from the AP forwarding EAPOL frames before verifying the sender's authentication status.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can inject EAPOL frames into the network which can cause DoS.
*   **Aid to Exploiting Other Vulnerabilities**:  This can facilitate the exploitation of other vulnerabilities in connected clients, as attackers could leverage this to inject traffic into the network prior to any authentication on the user side.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wireless Proximity:** Attackers need to be within Wi-Fi range of the vulnerable network.
*   **EAPOL Injection**: The attacker sends crafted EAPOL frames to the AP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** Attackers must be within the Wi-Fi range of the targeted network.
*   **Wireless Access**: Ability to send wireless traffic, and specifically crafted EAPOL frames, to the targeted AP.
*   **No Authentication Needed:**  The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user of the network.

**Additional Notes:**
*   Multiple sources mention that the Linux kernel's mac80211 implementation is vulnerable to this issue.
*   Some vendors state that they are not affected by this CVE, this is likely due to differences in their specific implementations or whether the product supports the AP role.
*   This vulnerability is related to the "FragAttacks" suite of Wi-Fi vulnerabilities.
*   Some vendors list workarounds, but a full resolution requires a software update.
