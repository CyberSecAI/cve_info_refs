  "CVE-2020-26259": {
    "description": "XStream is vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Deletion on the local host when unmarshalling as long as the executing process has sufficient rights.",
    "affected_versions": "All versions until and including version 1.4.14 are affected running in a Java environment containing the JAX-WS runtime, if using the version out of the box.",
    "root_cause": "The processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information. An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that result in the deletion of a file on the local host.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Arbitrary File Deletion"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can delete arbitrary files on the host as long as the executing process has sufficient rights only by manipulating the processed input stream.",
    "attack_vector": "By manipulating the processed input stream during unmarshalling.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker with the ability to manipulate the input stream being unmarshalled by XStream.",
     "workarounds": [
      "Use XStream's security framework to implement a whitelist for the allowed types.",
      "Users of XStream 1.4.14 who insist to use XStream default blacklist can simply add the following lines to XStream's setup code: xstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ \"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\" }); xstream.denyTypesByRegExp(new String[]{ \".*\\\\.ReadAllStream\\\\$FileStream\" });",
       "Users of XStream 1.4.13 who want to use XStream default blacklist can simply add the following three lines to XStream's setup code: xstream.denyTypes(new String[]{ \"javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter\", \"jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString\" }); xstream.denyTypes(new Class[]{ java.lang.ProcessBuilder.class }); xstream.denyTypesByRegExp(new String[]{ \".*\\\\.ReadAllStream\\\\$FileStream\" });",
        "Users of XStream 1.4.12 to 1.4.7 who want to use XStream with a blacklist will have to setup such a list from scratch and deny at least the following types: *javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter*, *java.beans.EventHandler*, *java.lang.ProcessBuilder*, *jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString*,  *java.lang.Void* and *void* and deny several types by name pattern.",
        "Users of XStream 1.4.6 or below can register an own converter to prevent the unmarshalling of the currently know critical types of the Java runtime. It is in fact an updated version of the workaround for CVE-2013-7285:"
