Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 83

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

##### References

* [Bug 1667113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113)

#### [#CVE-2020-26952: Out of memory handling of JITed, inlined functions could lead to a memory corruption](#CVE-2020-26952)

Reporter
Gary Kwong
Impact
high
##### Description

Incorrect bookkeeping of functions inlined during JIT compilation could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash when handling out-of-memory errors.

##### References

* [Bug 1667685](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667685)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1642028](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1642028)

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

##### References

* [Bug 1656741](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741)

#### [#CVE-2020-26954: Local spoofing of web manifests for arbitrary pages in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26954)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When accepting a malicious intent from other installed apps, Firefox for Android accepted manifests from arbitrary file paths and allowed declaring webapp manifests for other origins. This could be used to gain fullscreen access for UI spoofing and could also lead to cross-origin attacks on targeted websites.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1657026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1657026)

#### [#CVE-2020-26955: Cookies set during file downloads are shared between normal and Private Browsing Mode in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26955)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a user downloaded a file in Firefox for Android, if a cookie is set, it would have been re-sent during a subsequent file download operation on the same domain, regardless of whether the original and subsequent request were in private and non-private browsing modes.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1663261](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663261)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

##### References

* [Bug 1666300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300)

#### [#CVE-2020-26957: OneCRL was not working in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26957)

Reporter
Kevin Brosnan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

OneCRL was non-functional in the new Firefox for Android due to a missing service initialization. This could result in a failure to enforce some certificate revocations.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1667179](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667179)

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1669466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

##### References

* [Bug 1672223](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672223)

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

* [Bug 1672528](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672528)

#### [#CVE-2020-26962: Cross-origin iframes supported login autofill](#CVE-2020-26962)

Reporter
Paul Stone
Impact
low
##### Description

Cross-origin iframes that contained a login form could have been recognized by the login autofill service, and populated. This could have been used in clickjacking attacks, as well as be read across partitions in dynamic first party isolation.

##### References

* [Bug 610997](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=610997)

#### [#CVE-2020-26963: History and Location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser](#CVE-2020-26963)

Reporter
Sachin Raste
Impact
low
##### Description

Repeated calls to the history and location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser. This was addressed by introducing rate-limiting to these API calls.

##### References

* [Bug 1314912](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1314912)

#### [#CVE-2020-26964: Firefox for Android's Remote Debugging via USB could have been abused by untrusted apps on older versions of Android](#CVE-2020-26964)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
low
##### Description

If the Remote Debugging via USB feature was enabled in Firefox for Android on an Android version prior to Android 6.0, untrusted apps could have connected to the feature and operated with the privileges of the browser to read and interact with web content. The feature was implemented as a unix domain socket, protected by the Android SELinux policy; however, SELinux was not enforced for versions prior to 6.0. This was fixed by removing the Remote Debugging via USB feature from affected devices.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1658865](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1658865)

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

##### References

* [Bug 1661617](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661617)

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1663571](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571)

#### [#CVE-2020-26967: Mutation Observers could break or confuse Firefox Screenshots feature](#CVE-2020-26967)

Reporter
Kaizer Soze
Impact
low
##### Description

When listening for page changes with a Mutation Observer, a malicious web page could confuse Firefox Screenshots into interacting with elements other than those that it injected into the page. This would lead to internal errors and unexpected behavior in the Screenshots code.

Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Byron Campen, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

Filing this for kaisersoze, WIP for a screenshot bug. Currently if you take a screenshot of the testcase page using one of the two buttons in the top right (whole page or visible window) it will throw an exception in the extension itself. Seems to be trying to grab the screenshot iframe and getting there too early, but could be close to something like a priv-esc into the extension context if he gets the timing right.

Here is a revised testcase, that shows in web console that the contents of the screenshot extension become accessible. It's working for me locally on release, right now the screenshot extension doesn't even load for me in nightly.

To see it work, right click choose screenshot, and then open the web console.

If I would have had time, I planned on hijacking the event listeners possibly gaining access to the browser part of the extension. From there we would see. I believe i may not have the time though.

This only accesses the content that is injected into the page, right? Unfortunately there's no way for extensions to do better so they can't really trust their stuff once it's in the page. See [bug 1340930](/show_bug.cgi?id=1340930 "NEW - Add secure overlay API").

Of course, if the extension trusts it's injected content *unwisely* that can certainly lead to a security bug, but simply accessing the DOM bits aren't that.

[Sidenote: if possible, it would help if your testcases had basic instructions in them. Like in this revised testcase there's a button that says "Click me" but clicking it is not part of the test. If it were part of the test it is not clear if it was to be clicked before or after the screenshot, or really that screenshotting is involved at all.]

I've cc'd you on [bug 1414937](/show_bug.cgi?id=1414937 "RESOLVED FIXED") that results from that because it seems similar to what you've done here. Also on [bug 1389707](/show_bug.cgi?id=1389707 "RESOLVED FIXED") which is a spoof built on top of it. Those are known issues. A novel result would be getting the extension code itself to do something unexpected, or injecting script into the extension context (not content scripts).

The button and elements are there for the fact that the preview iframe will not initialize unless it has something to preview(ie elements).

I'll do more on this if it's not a security issue, then leave it as be and I will follow up and prove it. There's also two other possible attack vectors but I'll leave those for the future.

Let me clarify, IMHO patching this would be proof of violation of defense in depth. If this was not to be patched(I think that's what I prefer) then I'm sure with more time I can access the execution scope of the extension itself. The two other iframes contain a final check to verify that in fact they have properly loaded the extension URL, the preview iframe does not include this check for some reason(not sure why).

Either way is fine with me, I have a lot going on but will get back to this ASAP. You guys just let me know.

Some follow up notes, might help people understand what is going on here. A mutation observer is being used to detect when iframes are added to a page for screenshots(nothing new). After this the preview iframe is being selected because for some reason it lacks a final check that the correct extension URI is loaded, then the srcdoc property of that iframe is being set to "<html></html>" which provides a blank document as the extension expects.

When srcdoc and the src of an iframe are both set, srcdoc overwrites the src attribute, and loads the about:srcdoc URL into the window. The window remains content accessible. After this is done to the screenshot preview iframe, it lacks a final check to see that in fact it is at the expected extension URL(which the selection and preselection iframes both have). If in fact there are visible elements in the content page to preview, it initializes the preview iframe, and injects it's content into it, which in this case is completely accessible by content.

What appeared to be the timing issue from before was actually caused by the lack of visible elements. Sorry for the button that says click me, copy pasta rushing through work.

So I'm confused - the execution scope of the extension is mostly in a different process. Short of the extension using `eval` or similar, I don't see how you'd do this? Even the same-process bits (which do exist, just... there's less of it, and communication is via message passing) I'd expect to be insulated via the usual JS context and wrapper machinery.

It'd surprise me less if you could use this to cajole the extension into creating the "wrong" screenshot, or something. And that's not great, but isn't really the same as accessing the execution scope of the extension, right? Can you elaborate?

> The two other iframes contain a final check to verify that in fact they have properly loaded the extension URL, the preview iframe does not include this check for some reason(not sure why).

I agree this is odd.

Once you have access to the elements, there's always a possibility of code execution within the context based on the fact that there is a lot going on, that depends on text interaction on the elements(style changes considerably). I was aiming for elements that have event listeners, not they're vulnerable per say. I just had a hunch this could be much bigger.

There's @SubstitutedCSS and a few others things that get directly inlaid to HTML(given I have not confirmed they're able to be influenced externally, or apply to the preview iframe.)

There's more there, just not for me at the moment. Take this as is for now. I'll see what I can do in the meantime.

I have in fact looked over and understood the event listeners being mapped with a sort of wrapper function and SendEvent being used to communicate messages. Take it and work on it as is, as my current situation is less than encouraging especially with everything else going on in the world.

Sorry if anything is off there. sendEvent substitutedCss etc. I was working from memory, back into the code some now. I can now confirm this also works on nightly, but I assume you already knew that. I will follow up with any updates.

I'm not seeing a way to exploit this right now, but I do see a patch to put in place for this particular case. Simple one liner. Gijs, do you know who maintains this? I need to ask if there's a reason for using an onload handler on the preview iframe with iframe.onload instead of using addEventListener?

The use of assertIsBlankDocument, and using addEventListener instead of iframe.onload would lock down anything I could see to grasp at. I can do the patch, just give me a little time to see if it breaks things(will be later).

Also, is there a reason that assertIsTrusted is using macro expansion on an untrusted event? As in

const exc = new Error(`Received untrusted event (type: ${event.type})`);

Since the event isn't trusted, then the type *might* not be what is normally expected.

I don't know, off-hand I wouldn't have thought so. Equally, I'd expect both the onload setter and calls to addEventListener to be protected by wrapper handling (but I haven't checked). You could manually invoke the onload function, maybe, but then you could also manually dispatch an event with `dispatchEvent` (and write a custom `class MyEvent extends Event { get type() { /* evil things here */ } }` ) if so inclined, right?

But both `event.isTrusted` and `event.type` are properties on the DOM event so wrappers should get us the "real" DOM event property instead of any potential shadowing from a "fake" event. From a quick, non-screenshots-related test, this appears to work correctly from a chrome-privileged calling context and a non-chrome-privileged event dispatcher. It's possible that if the extension's interactions with the page happen in a scope that doesn't have a different privilege level (so same principal associated) that then there's no wrapper protection - but equally, in that case "hijacking" the extension script gives no greater power than what the page script could do itself anyway.

Ah, hm, so I guess the onload setter means that you can then directly invoke the handler via `node.onload("foo")` with arbitrary arguments, whereas `dispatchEvent` enforces that the object you pass is an Event, which gets the relevant wrapper.

Though again, I'd expect that wrappers for the different principals enforce that the relevant object we get passed have to be structured-clonable, so custom getters get lost?

This is in fact the case, or at least the function is a wrapper denying all access. I'm just wondering about the choice to use iframe.onload for the preview iframe where the selection, and pre-selection iframes use addEventListener? Is it necessary for screenshots to function properly?

It's sad to say that I am not up on Phabricator, or a properly integrating eslint editor. I am attempting to prepare a patch to stop this specific case here. I will see if I have time to test the difference in event handlers.

As a side note, I'm always weary of anything that involves Error, or an exception as sometimes they're are given to confusion between real objects and wrappers.

Sorry Gijs, I'm more than a bit out of touch with all the changes that have been made in recent times. More testing is needed from my end.

This needs a sec-rating before landing. Going with sec-low as per a quick skim and Gijs' suggestion.

Nice find, though!

Could someone put a sec-bounty flag on this. I know it's a low, but it's good work IMHO.

1. open <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=9176739> ("revision" testcase from this bug)
2. click the "click me" button
3. open the devtools web console
4. clear the console
5. in the page action menu, click "Take a Screenshot"
6. wait a few seconds
7. there should *not* be a console log statement that looks like this:

> HTMLAllCollection { 0: html, 1: head, 2: link, 3: style, 4: title, 5: body, 6: div.preview-overlay, 7: div.preview-image, 8: div.preview-buttons, 9: button.highlight-button-cancel, … }

Thank you for the steps.

What I'm seeing now on the latest Firefox Nightly is a shorter array HTMLAllCollection { 0: html, 1: head, 2: body, length: 3 } and the security error appears in the console after canceling the screenshot. (please see the screenshot attached, on the left is Firefox Nightly 82.0a1 (2020-09-18) and on the right is the latest Nightly)

I'm not sure if this the expected behaviour here.

Sorry for the delay - yes, this is expected behaviour - the difference is that the screenshots UI has not injected anything into the dummy document created by the exploit/testcase

The other thing you can/should check is that the following error appears in the browser console (need to have "show content messages" turned on):

> Error: iframe URL does not match expected blank.html

which also indicates the fix is working.

I'm not sure for the error received in the console (See attachment from [comment 32](/show_bug.cgi?id=1665820#c32 "VERIFIED FIXED - Screenshot exception with mutation observers")) where should I see if "show content messages" is turned on?

This error is in the browser console (open with ctrl/cmd-shift-j), not the regular devtools console. In the browser console there's a "cog"/gear icon in the top right which brings up a menu that has an option to "show content messages".

When you search "WillBeLeakedString" directly in the inbox, the Firefox will send the mDNS "willbeleakedstring.local" packet and bordcast to the local area network.

I have tested in the LAN and I can monitor what my colleagues have searched in the Firefox inbox.

I can also monitor in the VMWare what I have searched in the Host Machine(see the poc.gif).

The result is that any node in the LAN can monitor what others(Windows10 OS) have searched in the inbox via the Firefox Browser.

This is similar to [bug 1642623](/show_bug.cgi?id=1642623 "NEW - User's search term is accidentally sent to ISP without user's consent.") but the effects are probably worse. There's a hidden pref to turn this off ( introduced in [bug 1642943](/show_bug.cgi?id=1642943 "RESOLVED FIXED - Introduce a pref controlling post-facto dns resolution of single word hosts") ).

The Firefox code that checks whether this is a valid hostname just calls the DNS service's AsyncResolve, and I'd expect either a DNS request or a DNS-over-HTTPS request, but not this.

I can reproduce seeing the mDNS packets on my mac with wireshark while making requests on my Windows box (on the same wifi network). I don't know why this would be the case; I'd expect a direct DNS query from the Windows box to the DNS server (which I don't see in wireshark). Valentin, do we send out the `mDNS` packets ourselves, or is Windows doing that, or...? Is there a way to not do that, and if so, what would the potential negative consequences be?

This seems to be caused by windows due to us calling getaddrinfo.

I've tried it in all browsers, as well as in a python shell using `socket.gethostbyname` and they all trigger a `mdns` query.

I am not very sure about how what the [dns lookups](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/76a83d0a218837ba6937d6a0fac51cb0008c2334/browser/base/content/browser.js#1419-1420) for single word searches is supposed to do, but I assume it's to disambiguate between search and domain that exists on the local network?

In this case we can avoid the automatic mDNS lookup if we turn the hostname into FQDN by appending a `.` at the end. Any users that are actually trying to connect to `something.local` when typing `something` will have to add the `.local` part themselves.

Gijs, what do you think?

Edit: forgot to answer this - yes, that's right. We default to searching, and then do the lookup more or less simultaneously. There's a pref to make the lookup happen first, and recently we added a pref to turn it off altogether (as noted earlier). This is all because Windows DNS is... really slow, for some people / reasons? So otherwise, searching single words takes a lot longer, as we have to resolve the DNS first and wait for that.

Hm. I don't know how common the `.local` case is, maybe Marco has a better feel for it. However, from a quick web search, can we not use `GetAddrInfoEx` and specify we only want DNS, or would that have other drawbacks?

We don't have telemetry about this, thus I can't tell you how much .local is used, or even just expected. My gut feeling is that one should type it explicitly, but it may be worth to check we're not breaking an expected flow; did you test what the other browsers are doing? Chromium is doing an identical dns request for these words, are they also querying for .local?

Good question. We already have [bug 1500863](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1500863) filed, but that is a non-trivial amount of work.

There's another issue that on windows we do a [second DNS query](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/76a83d0a218837ba6937d6a0fac51cb0008c2334/netwerk/dns/GetAddrInfo.cpp#65) just to get the TTL values, that are not available to the usual getaddrinfo call. I seem to remember the reason for doing this is that `DnsQuery_A` is really slow - so we do it later, with a lower priority.

Which is why I'm concerned about just switching to `GetAddrInfoEx`. I really think we should do it, but we might not be able to ship it if it has worse performance.

Yes, I also see a `.local` mdns query in Chrome & Edge too.

If so we may have to put querying .local behind a pref, to avoid breaking expectations (enterprise mostly, I guess?); thus make the default a FQDN request, but allow to revert to the old method through the pref.

Can you link to such reports that are in public bugtrackers (even if the tickets are not publicly accessible - we can contact them out-of-band if we don't have access, but we need some way to reference the ticket) ? We'd like to not 0-day the other vendors with our fixes / release notes etc. if we can avoid it.

Valentin, I have this patch now - but I realized that for DNS requests that happen inside the browser (for "normal" http requests; used for names on the exception list (ie known hostnames) stored in Firefox's prefs, and/or if the user or enterprise has set `browser.fixup.dns_first_for_single_words` to true), the same thing happens. Should we make the same change there somehow? Or would that be more risky?

Sure. So the STR from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Info leak in the local area network when seach string(not domain) directly in the inbox(Windows 10)") are effectively:

1. open firefox
2. type `WillBeLeakedString` in the URL bar
3. hit enter

then you hit the code in browser.js that's modified in the phabricator patch.

if you insert 1b.:

1b. open about:config, set `browser.fixup.dns_first_for_single_words` to true

then you won't hit that code - instead, we'll try to actually navigate to `http://WillBeLeakedString/`, and for that pageload we need to do a dns lookup, and that still uses mDNS for me.

The same situation will happen (without the `dns_first_for_single_words` pref set) if the single word / hostname was already listed as existing. By default just `localhost` is in that list, but when the DNS query in browser.js is successful in finding a host for the input string, it shows a notification bar, and by clicking the button on the notification bar (ie "Yes, I meant to go to [http://<whatever>](http://%EF%BF%BDwhatever%3E)"), we add to the list. It's implemented using boolean prefs on the `browser.fixup.domainwhitelist.` pref prefix, ie `browser.fixup.domainwhitelist.localhost` is set to true by default, and in this case if you set the `browser.fixup.domainwhitelist.willbeleakedstring` pref to true, we'll also skip the search and go straight to navigating to `http://<host>/`.

Aha, I see. Thanks for the detailed explanation. This is a good question.

One option around this would be to turn the single label domain into a FQDN by adding a dot at the end in the DNS code. But that will break resolution of hostnames with a local domain suffix/workgroup, so it probably not what we want.

Another route would be to make the behaviour of `dns_first_for_single_words` be that we first resolve `WillBeLeakedString.` and if that fails we try `WillBeLeakedString`. But the added complexity of doing that for supporting non-default behaviour doesn't seem to be worth it.

In the end I think in the end it might be OK to land your patch and fix the bulk of this issue, and I'll try to implement [bug 1500863](/show_bug.cgi?id=1500863 "NEW - Use GetAddrInfoEx to resolve hosts on windows") ASAP in order to cover `dns_first_for_single_words` and `domainwhitelist` cases.

Right. We'd need to do this inside the http layer (at least, I'm assuming that's currently responsible for the lookups), too, which does make it more complicated.

I'd caveat the "non-default" behaviour though - AIUI, we will hit this case also for non-urlbar requests. That is, if a website has a link to `http://foo/` and the user clicks it and/or we speculatively connect, we'll look up "foo" directly, without regard to the URL bar prefs. Sorry for not being explicit about this in my previous comment... though I suppose this is a less common case (ie far fewer people encounter such links than search from the address bar), and also we don't know how the internal Windows stuff is implemented. That is, if `foo` really exists (more plausible if you regularly use such links), I don't know if Windows internally does the "normal" `nslookup` first, and only resorts to the `mDNS` ones once the DNS server tells it there are no results.

> In the end I think in the end it might be OK to land your patch and fix the bulk of this issue, and I'll try to implement [bug 1500863](/show_bug.cgi?id=1500863 "NEW - Use GetAddrInfoEx to resolve hosts on windows") ASAP in order to cover `dns_first_for_single_words` and `domainwhitelist` cases.

I agree, though I want to doublecheck that the above caveat doesn't change your opinion of whether this strategy is OK. :-)

> I don't know if Windows internally does the "normal" `nslookup` first, and only resorts to the `mDNS` ones once the DNS server tells it there are no results.

I just checked, and yes. that's how it works.

If I put something in the windows version of /etc/hosts and go to `http://something` no mdns queries happen.

Same if I use my computer's hostname. But if I use something else that doesn't exist, I see mdns queries.

> I'd caveat the "non-default" behaviour though - AIUI, we will hit this case also for non-urlbar requests. That is, if a website has a link to `http://foo/` and the user clicks it and/or we speculatively connect, we'll look up "foo" directly,

This is indeed a bit concerning. I wonder if we should disallow speculative dns prefetch & preconnect to single label domains.

I filed [bug 1664822](/show_bug.cgi?id=1664822 "RESOLVED WONTFIX") - I can write the patch if someone points me to the right place to check this in the speculative preconnect/prefetch code...

Do you think just disabling the prefetch will be sufficient to be able to ship this patch, too, and fix the remaining issue (for `dns_first_for_single_words` and navigations) in public [bug 1500863](/show_bug.cgi?id=1500863 "NEW - Use GetAddrInfoEx to resolve hosts on windows")?

> Hm. I don't know how common the `.local` case is, maybe Marco has a better feel for it. However, from a quick web search, can we not use `GetAddrInfoEx` and specify we only want DNS, or would that have other drawbacks? ( <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ws2tcpip/nf-ws2tcpip-getaddrinfoexw> )

So, I have a WIP patch that uses `GetAddrInfoExA` on Windows. Problem is that even if I only specify the `NS_DNS` namespace, it still does mDNS resolution for single label queries.

I've tried to dig into it, to see if there's a way around it and I couldn't find anything. Other that disabling the mDNS service on the machine.

I'm thinking that the fix here really would be to append a `.` to every single label DNS query. Maybe only on windows?

I've checked that it doesn't break hosts defined in `/etc/hosts` or querying the hostname of the machine.

phabbugz is broken but <https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D90240> will likely supersede the patch I attached here. :-)

OK, I will do that.

In fact I have submitted it to Chromium/Microsoft. However MSRC has closed the submition. Maybe I will submit it again to MSRC~

And now I can help to contact chromium team.

Update: it seems resolving single label names with DnsQuery has the unfortunate side effect of not returning a record when resolving the computer name. I'll keep digging for a workaround. It seems this approach works well with respecting DNS suffix settings.

[Bug 1663571](/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571 "VERIFIED FIXED - Info leak in the local area network when seach string(not domain) directly in the inbox(Windows 10)") - Resolve single label DNS queries using DnsQuery\_A r=dragana

### Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

* **User impact if declined**: leak of single word searches to other local network computers via mDNS
* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: No
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: Yes
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: Yes
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**: open wireshark. filter for `dns || mdns`

  do a single word search in the URL bar.

  Check that no mdns search is performed
* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Medium
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Using the new API may change behaviour in unexpected ways.

  We had to make an exception when the key matches the computer's name, and keep calling the old API - there may be other corner cases which are not well documented.

  On the bright side, this is guarded by a pref.
* **String changes made/needed**:

(In reply to tiebuchen from [comment #25](/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571#c25 "VERIFIED FIXED - Info leak in the local area network when seach string(not domain) directly in the inbox(Windows 10)"))

I can't see that bug, but if I look at the chrome bug mentioned in [bug 1642623](/show_bug.cgi?id=1642623 "NEW - User's search term is accidentally sent to ISP without user's consent.") I see that they think the two issues are dupes.

Hi,I don’t think they are dupes.The key part of this issue is the mDNS protocol in the LAN.If If no one points out the mDNS problem, it will not be fixed.In fact the issue of 1642623 has exited for years.

I don't think this is a dupe of [bug 1642623](/show_bug.cgi?id=1642623 "NEW - User's search term is accidentally sent to ISP without user's consent.") and is in fact a new and separate issue.

But :dveditz is the one who can make the call if it qualifies for a bug bounty.

Hi,

The chromium team set my report as a dupe and public it at first because of the misunderstanding of this vulnerability.

However they changed their minds after communication.

If chromium are still restricting their bug and have unduped, I think we should probably keep this hidden too, so gonna go ahead and re-add the sec group. My understanding is that this leak is to the local area LAN (so e.g. your coworkers could know what you searched for, but your ISP won't, from the mDNS query) whereas [bug 1642623](/show_bug.cgi?id=1642623 "NEW - User's search term is accidentally sent to ISP without user's consent.") is about your ISP finding out (but not your coworkers, as the "regular" DNS queries do not go to their machine). I'm sure Dan can/will revert if he feels strongly that this should remain unhidden.

It seems this fix breaks too many workflows.

I'm considering my new approach to detect whether the computer is on a public network, and only use the new API for those.

I took this off our bounty submission list when I thought it was a duplicate. Thanks for pointing that out and I've restored the nomination. However, bugs with a `sec-low` severity rating rarely qualify for a bounty. This will be evaluated by our bounty committee.

I have a WIP patch that works, but I'm unsure if it might also cause regressions.

Do you think we could land [attachment 9174804](/attachment.cgi?id=9174804 "Bug 1663571, r?mak") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=9174804&action=edit "Bug 1663571, r?mak") instead? That should fix the majority of single label domain leaks.

How would we feel about landing the front-end patch in soft freeze? It already had r+...

I'm aware that there were previously regressions, but also AFAICT the trailing dot thing shouldn't break netbios resolution like before (cf. <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1677806#c6> ).

Either we land this now, or early in the next release cycle and uplift to beta. Either way it will be in Firefox 92. I am leaning toward landing now.

Btw, if I understand the code correctly, this would only fixup `keyword` to `keyword.` in the URL bar, but wouldn't turn `http://word` to `http://word.`, right?

Hi,

@Valentin, should I verify the Nightly 92 fix by following the same steps from [comment 35](/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571#c35 "VERIFIED FIXED - Info leak in the local area network when seach string(not domain) directly in the inbox(Windows 10)"), are those steps still valid in order to verify this?

Thanks!

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**:
* **User impact if declined**: Single word inputs to the URL bar will be broadcast to the local network via mDNS in the attempt to determine if that word is the name of a computer on the network.

  This is a builtin behaviour of getaddrinfo on Windows. This fix works around that by appending a `.` to the name, turning it into a FQDN, which prevents the mDNS request from happening.
* **Fix Landed on Version**: 92
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Chrome has shipped a similar fix to this problem, so the risk is low here.

  As opposed to the previous attempted fix, fixing the issue in the URL bar ensures we only change the behaviour when one searches for a word, not when someone attempts to load `http://oneword`.

  This change is also guarded by a pref which we can disable through normandy if we see any problems.
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**:
