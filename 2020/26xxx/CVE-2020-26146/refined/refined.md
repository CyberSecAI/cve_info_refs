Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-26146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the improper handling of packet numbers during the reassembly of encrypted fragments in Wi-Fi communications. Specifically, vulnerable implementations do not enforce that packet numbers within fragmented frames are consecutive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Fragment Reassembly:** The primary vulnerability is that devices accept and reassemble encrypted fragments even if their packet numbers are not sequential. This violates the expected order and allows for manipulation of the reassembled data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** By injecting fragments with specific packet numbers, an attacker can potentially extract selected data fragments from a victim's communication.
*   **Traffic Manipulation:** Combined with other vulnerabilities or attack techniques, this could lead to the injection of malicious payloads and manipulation of network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Network:** The attacker must be within the range of the vulnerable Wi-Fi network to intercept and manipulate the wireless traffic.
*   **Multi-channel machine-in-the-middle (MitM):** A more reliable exploit of this vulnerability relies on an attacker performing a multi-channel machine-in-the-middle attack by cloning an AP on another channel to manipulate and inject frames.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within the range of the target Wi-Fi network to intercept and manipulate wireless communications.
*   **MitM Capability:**  A multi-channel machine-in-the-middle position is required. This involves creating a malicious access point that lures the victim into connecting.
*   **Traffic Monitoring:** The attacker must be able to monitor the wireless communication between a client and the access point to identify fragmented frames and craft malicious injections.
*   **Packet Injection:** The attacker must be able to send crafted packets to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected protocols:** The vulnerability affects WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 protocols.
*   **Common implementation flaw:** The vulnerability stems from a common implementation flaw where developers did not properly check the sequence of packet numbers during reassembly.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is not easy to mitigate, and the root cause must be addressed for full protection.
*   **Theoretical and practical implications:** The attack is considered hard to exploit and it relies on the attacker performing a multi-channel MitM position to reliably inject fragmented packets.

**In summary, CVE-2020-26146 is a vulnerability caused by the lack of sequence number verification during the reassembly of fragmented Wi-Fi packets. An attacker leveraging this vulnerability, especially using a MitM attack, can potentially inject and exfiltrate selected data, although this attack requires specific conditions, and it is hard to abuse on its own.**
