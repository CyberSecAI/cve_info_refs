The provided content is related to a security advisory for a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability, which aligns with the nature of CVE descriptions. While the advisory doesn't mention a CVE ID directly, it provides details about a specific vulnerability (PSV-2020-0036) affecting several NETGEAR Orbi WiFi system models. It includes a CVSS score, affected products and firmware versions, and mitigation instructions (firmware upgrade).

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The advisory mentions a "sensitive information disclosure security vulnerability" without providing the technical root cause.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Sensitive Information Disclosure

**Impact of exploitation:**
The advisory states, "The sensitive information disclosure vulnerability remains if you do not complete all recommended steps." This implies that exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. The impact is further qualified by CVSS metrics:
* Confidentiality: High (C:H)
* Integrity: High (I:H)
* Availability: Low (A:L)
This shows that the vulnerability has a severe impact on data confidentiality and integrity and a low impact on availability.

**Attack vectors:**
The CVSS vector string indicates that the attack vector is "Adjacent" (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network or within the same broadcast domain as the affected device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The CVSS vector string shows that no special privileges are required (PR:N) and no user interaction is needed (UI:N). An attacker on the same network can exploit the vulnerability without credentials.

**Affected Products and Firmware Versions:**
*   RBK752, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBR750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBS750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBK852, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBR850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBS850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25

**Additional Information:**
* The advisory is identified as PSV-2020-0036.
* The CVSS v3 score is 9.6, which is considered critical.
* The advisory was published on 2020-09-17.
