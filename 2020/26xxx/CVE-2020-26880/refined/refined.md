{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The sympa.conf configuration file, owned by the 'sympa' user, is parsed by the setuid sympa_newaliases-wrapper as root. This wrapper can execute arbitrary commands due to backticks syntax within the configuration file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure file permissions on sympa.conf",
      "Use of setuid executable with insufficient input sanitization",
      "Arbitrary command execution through backticks"
    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation from the 'sympa' user to full root shell access.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access to the system where sympa is installed.",
    "required_capabilities": "Compromise of the 'sympa' user account, allowing modification of the sympa.conf file."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "mitigation": "Replacing sympa_newaliases-wrapper with an alternate alias manager.",
    "credits": "Credits to @lightsey for discovering the vulnerability."
