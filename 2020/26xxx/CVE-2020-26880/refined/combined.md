**Note by admin: this issue is dedicated to measures against [CVE-2020-26880](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26880).**

---

## Version

any

## Installation method

any

## Expected behavior

user 'sympa' only execute specific tasks as root and cannot gain more privileges, following the principles of privileges separation

## Actual behavior

user 'sympa' can obtain full root shell access

## Additional information

Following up on [#943 (comment)](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/943#issuecomment-704779420)

> A more concrete vulnerability you document in your patch, is that sympa.conf (as well as its entire directory) is owned by user 'sympa', so an attacker who compromised [the 'sympa' user] can directly edit the main [sympa.conf] and escalate to root.

Given that the configuration file is parsed as root through the setuid sympa\_newaliases-wrapper, and can execute arbitrary commands through its backticks syntax, there is an unintentional privilege escalation from sympa to full root shell access.

The information is public in the aforementioned thread hence this bug introduce no confidential information and is reported publicly as well.

(This also allows for CVE assignment for small projects without a CNA able to run a full embargo procedure.)

Mitigations include replacing sympa\_newaliases-wrapper by an alternate alias manager, see e.g. <https://tribut.de/blog/sympa-and-postfix> .

Package        : sympa
Version        : 6.2.16~dfsg-3+deb9u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1000671 CVE-2020-26880
Debian Bug     : 908165 972189

A privilege escalation was discovered in Sympa, a modern mailing list
manager. It is fixed when Sympa is used in conjunction with common
MTAs (such as Exim or Postfix) by disabling a setuid executable,
although no fix is currently available for all environments (such as
sendmail).  Additionally, an open-redirect vulnerability was
discovered and fixed.

CVE-2020-26880

    Sympa allows a local privilege escalation from the sympa user
    account to full root access by modifying the sympa.conf
    configuration file (which is owned by sympa) and parsing it
    through the setuid sympa_newaliases-wrapper executable.

CVE-2018-1000671

    Sympa contains a CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open
    Redirect') vulnerability in The "referer" parameter of the
    wwsympa.fcgi login action. that can result in Open redirection and
    reflected XSS via data URIs.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
6.2.16~dfsg-3+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your sympa packages.

For the detailed security status of sympa please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/sympa>

#### #2583 Request for a mini mass rebuild to update systemd scriptlets in packages Closed: Accepted 3 years ago by cverna. Opened 3 years ago by zbyszek.

Closed: Accepted
Reopen Issue

I pushed systemd-248-rc1 which has updated scriptlets and transfiletriggers to implement <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Restart_services_at_end_of_rpm_transaction>. But this is not effective without actually rebuilding packages which use those rpm macros. Obviously this should have been pushed before the mass rebuild, but the code went through many iterations and wasn't ready then ;(

The change in macros is the following:

```
 %systemd_postun_with_restart() \
 %{expand:%%{?__systemd_someargs_%#:%%__systemd_someargs_%# systemd_postun_with_restart}} \
 if [ $1 -ge 1 ] && [ -x @bindir@/systemctl ]; then \
         # Package upgrade, not uninstall \
-        @bindir@/systemctl try-restart %{?*} || : \
+        for unit in %{?*}; do \
+                @bindir@/systemctl set-property $unit Markers=+needs-restart || : \
+        done \
 fi \
 %{nil}

```

As packages are rebuilt for other reasons, new version of the macro will be used anyway. But I think having the new macro in some packages and some in old will be annoying. Also, since this fixes a long-standing annoying issue, I think it'd be better to rebuild with this rather than wait for packages to be rebuilt for other reasons.

Thus, I'd like to do a "mini mass rebuild" with no changes except a release bump for relevant packages. I think `dnf repoquery --qf '%{sourcerpm}' --whatprovides '/usr/lib/systemd/system/*service'`, which yield 781 entries, is the right query. I'd like to do the rebuild after beta freeze ends. I'd do it myself.

EDIT: the goal is to do this in `branched`. But `rawhide` could be done too. It would probably make sense to do `rawhide` first, and then do `branched` after the beta freeze ends.

Bumping the spec files in branched only might confuse some packagers. I'd bumpspec in rawhide and for packages that are not diverged yet I'd merge to f34.

I rebuilt the packages in rawhide yesterday. 495 were successful, 23 FTBFS (for unrelated reasons).

If the sky doesn't come down in rawhide, I'll build for `f34` later this week.

In general just the sad state of package rebuildability in Fedora.

I fixed `bluez`: <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/bluez/c/fdda690e478cc1581c12265af16d043c757758dd?branch=rawhide>.

`postgresql` was some serialization failure on s390x in tests, looks like an upstream arch-specific bug.

I didn't look at the other ones, but it seems to be arch-specific stuff, s390x quite often.

`pesign` and `fwupd` just need to be tagged by someone with appropriate privileges. [@kevin](https://pagure.io/user/kevin) can you handle that?

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 34 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GNUToolchain](/wiki/Changes/GNUToolchain "Changes/GNUToolchain")
* [F34Boost175](/wiki/Changes/F34Boost175 "Changes/F34Boost175")
* [F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F34MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [golang1.16](/wiki/Changes/golang1.16 "Changes/golang1.16")
* [Remove\_make\_from\_BuildRoot](/wiki/Changes/Remove_make_from_BuildRoot "Changes/Remove make from BuildRoot")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, Januar 20th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

### Remove make from BuildRoot

*koji block-group-pkg f34-rebuild build make*

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f34
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f34. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f34 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f34
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-01-20 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

## Description

![@Beuc](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/980977?u=ebd1a7b491cae0a6c408db9296b6739bd5c423ad&v=4&size=48)[Beuc](https://github.com/Beuc)opened [on Oct 7, 2020](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/1009#issue-716636662)

**Note by admin: this issue is dedicated to measures against [CVE-2020-26880](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26880).**

---

## Version

any

## Installation method

any

## Expected behavior

user 'sympa' only execute specific tasks as root and cannot gain more privileges, following the principles of privileges separation

## Actual behavior

user 'sympa' can obtain full root shell access

## Additional information

Following up on [#943 (comment)](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa/issues/943#issuecomment-704779420)

> A more concrete vulnerability you document in your patch, is that sympa.conf (as well as its entire directory) is owned by user 'sympa', so an attacker who compromised [the 'sympa' user] can directly edit the main [sympa.conf] and escalate to root.

Given that the configuration file is parsed as root through the setuid sympa\_newaliases-wrapper, and can execute arbitrary commands through its backticks syntax, there is an unintentional privilege escalation from sympa to full root shell access.

The information is public in the aforementioned thread hence this bug introduce no confidential information and is reported publicly as well.

(This also allows for CVE assignment for small projects without a CNA able to run a full embargo procedure.)

Mitigations include replacing sympa\_newaliases-wrapper by an alternate alias manager, see e.g. <https://tribut.de/blog/sympa-and-postfix> .

Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 32 on 2021-05-25. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '32'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 32 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1886232#c3)  Fedora Update System    2021-04-30 16:42:48 UTC  ``` FEDORA-EPEL-2021-3f4ec3ba2a has been submitted as an update to Fedora EPEL 7. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-EPEL-2021-3f4ec3ba2a>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1886232#c4)  Fedora Update System    2021-04-30 16:42:49 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2021-a309986711 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 33. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-a309986711>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1886232#c5)  Fedora Update System    2021-04-30 16:42:50 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2021-aa993dd633 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 32. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-aa993dd633>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1886232#c6)  Fedora Update System    2021-05-01 02:05:31 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2021-af8fa074ad has been pushed to the Fedora 34 testing repository.
