This may be privacy issue, I file as sec bug at first.

Actually, software keyboard type depends on current `type` attribute of `input` element. If type is password, we change to password layout. So if `type` attribute is changed, keyboard layout is also changed. This is managed by `IMEStateManager` to using `type` and `inputmode`.

But although some web site has "Show password' icon not to mask password input, the following issue occurs.

### Env

Fenix with GBoard. I guess that this occurs on Windows tablet.

### Step

1. Access to [www.google.com](http://www.google.com)
2. Enter google account email address.
3. Focus password field.
4. Click "Show password" icon.

### Actual Result

Keyboard layout is changed to non-password style.

### Actual Google Chrome Result

Even if tapping "Show password" icon, keyboard layout isn't changed. Although I heard from Googler that they consider this situation to keep keyboard layout for password.

I think that Chrome's way is better for password field. Although most software keyboard leans input history if not password layout, "Show password" causes that software keyboard learns inputted password even if this is password field as web site.

Even if focus is moved back again? And even if "Show password" is tapped before getting focus?

(FYI: In the future, [this should be solved without changing the `type` attribute](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2495#issuecomment-380397331).)

Set focus then tap "unmask password" icon.

Only in the case we need to support, we can make `IMEStateManager` cache the **first** `type` value when setting IME context.

I think we have a `hasBeenTypePassword` property (webidl attribute) on input elements that can help fix this.

[Bug 1661617](/show_bug.cgi?id=1661617 "RESOLVED FIXED - Changing to <input type=password> to <input type=text> causes software keyboard type is changed to non-password style") - Use password hint for software keyboard.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: This is a kind of privacy issue. When using some web sites such as Google's login page, password field can change to non-masked input when clicking eye icon. Then, inputting password on this situation causes that software keyboard/IME learns input history unfortunately even if it is password. So, attacher have to access physical device to get password that is inputted.

Attacker knows that we set password style layout on some additional conditions from this fix, but it is no way to get password without accessing physical device.

* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: all
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**:
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: If text field was password type, and this field is re-used for other thing such as user name, the layout of software keyboard may keep password style.

  But I think that this is too rare case and this new behavior is same as Chrome for Android. So if regression occurs, Chrome will have also same issue.

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: This is privacy issue. IME might learn password input that text box was password box. (Ex. Google's login form can change non-masked input form for password.)
* **User impact if declined**: This is a kind of privacy issue. When using some web sites such as Google's login page, password field can change to non-masked input when clicking eye icon. Then, inputting password on this situation causes that software keyboard/IME learns input history unfortunately even if it is password. So, attacker have to access physical device to get password that is inputted.
* **Fix Landed on Version**: 83
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Low risk for most users. Most users don't use IME and this uses on Windows/Linux IME only.
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**: no

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9174314&action=edit)

When you search "WillBeLeakedString" directly in the inbox, the Firefox will send the mDNS "willbeleakedstring.local" packet and bordcast to the local area network.

I have tested in the LAN and I can monitor what my colleagues have searched in the Firefox inbox.

I can also monitor in the VMWare what I have searched in the Host Machine(see the poc.gif).

The result is that any node in the LAN can monitor what others(Windows10 OS) have searched in the inbox via the Firefox Browser.

This is similar to [bug 1642623](/show_bug.cgi?id=1642623 "NEW - User's search term is accidentally sent to ISP without user's consent.") but the effects are probably worse. There's a hidden pref to turn this off ( introduced in [bug 1642943](/show_bug.cgi?id=1642943 "RESOLVED FIXED - Introduce a pref controlling post-facto dns resolution of single word hosts") ).

The Firefox code that checks whether this is a valid hostname just calls the DNS service's AsyncResolve, and I'd expect either a DNS request or a DNS-over-HTTPS request, but not this.

I can reproduce seeing the mDNS packets on my mac with wireshark while making requests on my Windows box (on the same wifi network). I don't know why this would be the case; I'd expect a direct DNS query from the Windows box to the DNS server (which I don't see in wireshark). Valentin, do we send out the `mDNS` packets ourselves, or is Windows doing that, or...? Is there a way to not do that, and if so, what would the potential negative consequences be?

This seems to be caused by windows due to us calling getaddrinfo.

I've tried it in all browsers, as well as in a python shell using `socket.gethostbyname` and they all trigger a `mdns` query.

I am not very sure about how what the [dns lookups](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/76a83d0a218837ba6937d6a0fac51cb0008c2334/browser/base/content/browser.js#1419-1420) for single word searches is supposed to do, but I assume it's to disambiguate between search and domain that exists on the local network?

In this case we can avoid the automatic mDNS lookup if we turn the hostname into FQDN by appending a `.` at the end. Any users that are actually trying to connect to `something.local` when typing `something` will have to add the `.local` part themselves.

Gijs, what do you think?

Edit: forgot to answer this - yes, that's right. We default to searching, and then do the lookup more or less simultaneously. There's a pref to make the lookup happen first, and recently we added a pref to turn it off altogether (as noted earlier). This is all because Windows DNS is... really slow, for some people / reasons? So otherwise, searching single words takes a lot longer, as we have to resolve the DNS first and wait for that.

Hm. I don't know how common the `.local` case is, maybe Marco has a better feel for it. However, from a quick web search, can we not use `GetAddrInfoEx` and specify we only want DNS, or would that have other drawbacks?

We don't have telemetry about this, thus I can't tell you how much .local is used, or even just expected. My gut feeling is that one should type it explicitly, but it may be worth to check we're not breaking an expected flow; did you test what the other browsers are doing? Chromium is doing an identical dns request for these words, are they also querying for .local?

Good question. We already have [bug 1500863](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1500863) filed, but that is a non-trivial amount of work.

There's another issue that on windows we do a [second DNS query](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/76a83d0a218837ba6937d6a0fac51cb0008c2334/netwerk/dns/GetAddrInfo.cpp#65) just to get the TTL values, that are not available to the usual getaddrinfo call. I seem to remember the reason for doing this is that `DnsQuery_A` is really slow - so we do it later, with a lower priority.

Which is why I'm concerned about just switching to `GetAddrInfoEx`. I really think we should do it, but we might not be able to ship it if it has worse performance.

If so we may have to put querying .local behind a pref, to avoid breaking expectations (enterprise mostly, I guess?); thus make the default a FQDN request, but allow to revert to the old method through the pref.

Can you link to such reports that are in public bugtrackers (even if the tickets are not publicly accessible - we can contact them out-of-band if we don't have access, but we need some way to reference the ticket) ? We'd like to not 0-day the other vendors with our fixes / release notes etc. if we can avoid it.

Valentin, I have this patch now - but I realized that for DNS requests that happen inside the browser (for "normal" http requests; used for names on the exception list (ie known hostnames) stored in Firefox's prefs, and/or if the user or enterprise has set `browser.fixup.dns_first_for_single_words` to true), the same thing happens. Should we make the same change there somehow? Or would that be more risky?

Sure. So the STR from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Info leak in the local area network when seach string(not domain) directly in the inbox(Windows 10)") are effectively:

1. open firefox
2. type `WillBeLeakedString` in the URL bar
3. hit enter

then you hit the code in browser.js that's modified in the phabricator patch.

if you insert 1b.:

1b. open about:config, set `browser.fixup.dns_first_for_single_words` to true

then you won't hit that code - instead, we'll try to actually navigate to `http://WillBeLeakedString/`, and for that pageload we need to do a dns lookup, and that still uses mDNS for me.

The same situation will happen (without the `dns_first_for_single_words` pref set) if the single word / hostname was already listed as existing. By default just `localhost` is in that list, but when the DNS query in browser.js is successful in finding a host for the input string, it shows a notification bar, and by clicking the button on the notification bar (ie "Yes, I meant to go to [http://<whatever>](http://%EF%BF%BDwhatever%3E)"), we add to the list. It's implemented using boolean prefs on the `browser.fixup.domainwhitelist.` pref prefix, ie `browser.fixup.domainwhitelist.localhost` is set to true by default, and in this case if you set the `browser.fixup.domainwhitelist.willbeleakedstring` pref to true, we'll also skip the search and go straight to navigating to `http://<host>/`.

Aha, I see. Thanks for the detailed explanation. This is a good question.

One option around this would be to turn the single label domain into a FQDN by adding a dot at the end in the DNS code. But that will break resolution of hostnames with a local domain suffix/workgroup, so it probably not what we want.

Another route would be to make the behaviour of `dns_first_for_single_words` be that we first resolve `WillBeLeakedString.` and if that fails we try `WillBeLeakedString`. But the added complexity of doing that for supporting non-default behaviour doesn't seem to be worth it.

In the end I think in the end it might be OK to land your patch and fix the bulk of this issue, and I'll try to implement [bug 1500863](/show_bug.cgi?id=1500863 "NEW - Use GetAddrInfoEx to resolve hosts on windows") ASAP in order to cover `dns_first_for_single_words` and `domainwhitelist` cases.

Right. We'd need to do this inside the http layer (at least, I'm assuming that's currently responsible for the lookups), too, which does make it more complicated.

I'd caveat the "non-default" behaviour though - AIUI, we will hit this case also for non-urlbar requests. That is, if a website has a link to `http://foo/` and the user clicks it and/or we speculatively connect, we'll look up "foo" directly, without regard to the URL bar prefs. Sorry for not being explicit about this in my previous comment... though I suppose this is a less common case (ie far fewer people encounter such links than search from the address bar), and also we don't know how the internal Windows stuff is implemented. That is, if `foo` really exists (more plausible if you regularly use such links), I don't know if Windows internally does the "normal" `nslookup` first, and only resorts to the `mDNS` ones once the DNS server tells it there are no results.

> In the end I think in the end it might be OK to land your patch and fix the bulk of this issue, and I'll try to implement [bug 1500863](/show_bug.cgi?id=1500863 "NEW - Use GetAddrInfoEx to resolve hosts on windows") ASAP in order to cover `dns_first_for_single_words` and `domainwhitelist` cases.

I agree, though I want to doublecheck that the above caveat doesn't change your opinion of whether this strategy is OK. :-)

I just checked, and yes. that's how it works.

If I put something in the windows version of /etc/hosts and go to `http://something` no mdns queries happen.

Same if I use my computer's hostname. But if I use something else that doesn't exist, I see mdns queries.

This is indeed a bit concerning. I wonder if we should disallow speculative dns prefetch & preconnect to single label domains.

( <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ws2tcpip/nf-ws2tcpip-getaddrinfoexw> )

So, I have a WIP patch that uses `GetAddrInfoExA` on Windows. Problem is that even if I only specify the `NS_DNS` namespace, it still does mDNS resolution for single label queries.

I've tried to dig into it, to see if there's a way around it and I couldn't find anything. Other that disabling the mDNS service on the machine.

I'm thinking that the fix here really would be to append a `.` to every single label DNS query. Maybe only on windows?

I've checked that it doesn't break hosts defined in `/etc/hosts` or querying the hostname of the machine.

Update: it seems resolving single label names with DnsQuery has the unfortunate side effect of not returning a record when resolving the computer name. I'll keep digging for a workaround. It seems this approach works well with respecting DNS suffix settings.

Flags: needinfo?(jstutte)

Yes it is. I was considering to land it this week, but Chrome doesn't have a patch ready yet, so I was thinking to land it next week and uplift it to beta instead.

### Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

* **User impact if declined**: leak of single word searches to other local network computers via mDNS
* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: No
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: Yes
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: Yes
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**: open wireshark. filter for `dns || mdns`

  do a single word search in the URL bar.

  Check that no mdns search is performed
* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Medium
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Using the new API may change behaviour in unexpected ways.

  We had to make an exception when the key matches the computer's name, and keep calling the old API - there may be other corner cases which are not well documented.

  On the bright side, this is guarded by a pref.
* **String changes made/needed**:

Reproduced the initial issue in Beta 83.0b7 using Windows 10 and wireshark tool, following the steps from [comment 35](/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571#c35 "VERIFIED FIXED - Info leak in the local area network when seach string(not domain) directly in the inbox(Windows 10)"). There are both DNS and mDNS displayed using the "dns or mdns" filter in the Protocol column.

Verified - Fixed in latest Nightly 84.0a1 (build id: 20201102095541) on Windows 10. There is no mDNS displayed using the same "dns or mdns" filter after performing a single word search.

I can't see that bug, but if I look at the chrome bug mentioned in [bug 1642623](/show_bug.cgi?id=1642623 "NEW - User's search term is accidentally sent to ISP without user's consent.") I see that they think the two issues are dupes.

Hi,I don’t think they are dupes.The key part of this issue is the mDNS protocol in the LAN.If If no one points out the mDNS problem, it will not be fixed.In fact the issue of 1642623 has exited for years.

I don't think this is a dupe of [bug 1642623](/show_bug.cgi?id=1642623 "NEW - User's search term is accidentally sent to ISP without user's consent.") and is in fact a new and separate issue.

Hi,

The chromium team set my report as a dupe and public it at first because of the misunderstanding of this vulnerability.

However they changed their minds after communication.

If chromium are still restricting their bug and have unduped, I think we should probably keep this hidden too, so gonna go ahead and re-add the sec group. My understanding is that this leak is to the local area LAN (so e.g. your coworkers could know what you searched for, but your ISP won't, from the mDNS query) whereas [bug 1642623](/show_bug.cgi?id=1642623 "NEW - User's search term is accidentally sent to ISP without user's consent.") is about your ISP finding out (but not your coworkers, as the "regular" DNS queries do not go to their machine). I'm sure Dan can/will revert if he feels strongly that this should remain unhidden.

It seems this fix breaks too many workflows.

I'm considering my new approach to detect whether the computer is on a public network, and only use the new API for those.

How would we feel about landing the front-end patch in soft freeze? It already had r+...

I'm aware that there were previously regressions, but also AFAICT the trailing dot thing shouldn't break netbios resolution like before (cf. <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1677806#c6> ).

Either we land this now, or early in the next release cycle and uplift to beta. Either way it will be in Firefox 92. I am leaning toward landing now.

Btw, if I understand the code correctly, this would only fixup `keyword` to `keyword.` in the URL bar, but wouldn't turn `http://word` to `http://word.`, right?

Hi,

@Valentin, should I verify the Nightly 92 fix by following the same steps from [comment 35](/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571#c35 "VERIFIED FIXED - Info leak in the local area network when seach string(not domain) directly in the inbox(Windows 10)"), are those steps still valid in order to verify this?

Thanks!

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**:
* **User impact if declined**: Single word inputs to the URL bar will be broadcast to the local network via mDNS in the attempt to determine if that word is the name of a computer on the network.

  This is a builtin behaviour of getaddrinfo on Windows. This fix works around that by appending a `.` to the name, turning it into a FQDN, which prevents the mDNS request from happening.
* **Fix Landed on Version**: 92
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Chrome has shipped a similar fix to this problem, so the risk is low here.

  As opposed to the previous attempted fix, fixing the issue in the URL bar ensures we only change the behaviour when one searches for a word, not when someone attempts to load `http://oneword`.

  This change is also guarded by a pref which we can disable through normandy if we see any problems.
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**:

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2020-52

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 78.5

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 78.5

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Thunderbird's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Thunderbird did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

Reporter

Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

Reporter

Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Thunderbird this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Steve Fink, Jason Kratzer, Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2020-51

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 78.5

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 78.5

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

##### References

* [Bug 1667113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1642028](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1642028)

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

##### References

* [Bug 1656741](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

##### References

* [Bug 1666300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300)

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1669466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

##### References

* [Bug 1672223](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672223)

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

##### References

* [Bug 1672528](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672528)

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

##### References

* [Bug 1661617](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661617)

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1663571](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571)

#### [#CVE-2020-26968: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 83 and Firefox ESR 78.5](#CVE-2020-26968)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Steve Fink, Jason Kratzer, Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

Impact
high
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 83

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

* [Bug 1667113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113)

#### [#CVE-2020-26952: Out of memory handling of JITed, inlined functions could lead to a memory corruption](#CVE-2020-26952)

Reporter
Gary Kwong
Impact
high
##### Description

Incorrect bookkeeping of functions inlined during JIT compilation could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash when handling out-of-memory errors.

##### References

* [Bug 1667685](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667685)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

* [Bug 1642028](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1642028)

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

* [Bug 1656741](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741)

#### [#CVE-2020-26954: Local spoofing of web manifests for arbitrary pages in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26954)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When accepting a malicious intent from other installed apps, Firefox for Android accepted manifests from arbitrary file paths and allowed declaring webapp manifests for other origins. This could be used to gain fullscreen access for UI spoofing and could also lead to cross-origin attacks on targeted websites.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1657026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1657026)

#### [#CVE-2020-26955: Cookies set during file downloads are shared between normal and Private Browsing Mode in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26955)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a user downloaded a file in Firefox for Android, if a cookie is set, it would have been re-sent during a subsequent file download operation on the same domain, regardless of whether the original and subsequent request were in private and non-private browsing modes.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1663261](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663261)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

##### References

* [Bug 1666300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300)

#### [#CVE-2020-26957: OneCRL was not working in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26957)

Reporter
Kevin Brosnan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

OneCRL was non-functional in the new Firefox for Android due to a missing service initialization. This could result in a failure to enforce some certificate revocations.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1667179](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667179)

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1669466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

* [Bug 1672223](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672223)

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

* [Bug 1672528](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672528)

#### [#CVE-2020-26962: Cross-origin iframes supported login autofill](#CVE-2020-26962)

Reporter
Paul Stone
Impact
low
##### Description

Cross-origin iframes that contained a login form could have been recognized by the login autofill service, and populated. This could have been used in clickjacking attacks, as well as be read across partitions in dynamic first party isolation.

* [Bug 610997](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=610997)

#### [#CVE-2020-26963: History and Location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser](#CVE-2020-26963)

Reporter
Sachin Raste
Impact
low
##### Description

Repeated calls to the history and location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser. This was addressed by introducing rate-limiting to these API calls.

##### References

* [Bug 1314912](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1314912)

#### [#CVE-2020-26964: Firefox for Android's Remote Debugging via USB could have been abused by untrusted apps on older versions of Android](#CVE-2020-26964)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
low
##### Description

If the Remote Debugging via USB feature was enabled in Firefox for Android on an Android version prior to Android 6.0, untrusted apps could have connected to the feature and operated with the privileges of the browser to read and interact with web content. The feature was implemented as a unix domain socket, protected by the Android SELinux policy; however, SELinux was not enforced for versions prior to 6.0. This was fixed by removing the Remote Debugging via USB feature from affected devices.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1658865](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1658865)

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

* [Bug 1661617](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661617)

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1663571](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571)

#### [#CVE-2020-26967: Mutation Observers could break or confuse Firefox Screenshots feature](#CVE-2020-26967)

Reporter
Kaizer Soze
Impact
low
##### Description

When listening for page changes with a Mutation Observer, a malicious web page could confuse Firefox Screenshots into interacting with elements other than those that it injected into the page. This would lead to internal errors and unexpected behavior in the Screenshots code.

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Byron Campen, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
