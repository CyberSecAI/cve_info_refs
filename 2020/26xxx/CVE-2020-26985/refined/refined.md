Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-26985:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing RGB and SGI files within Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  The lack of input validation leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when copying user-supplied data into a heap-allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Application Crash:**  The vulnerability can also cause the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Files:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted malicious RGB or SGI file using the vulnerable software.
*   **Malicious Pages:** The user can also be targeted by directing them to a malicious page, likely exploiting the software's ability to process these file types, although the content specifically mentions 'malicious file' as a more direct attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker requires user interaction to be successful. The user has to either open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify RGB/SGI files with malicious data to trigger the overflow.
*  **Local Access (as per CVSS score):** The CVSS score indicates Local access (AV:L) is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability although the description mentions the attack as remote. This can be confusing and may require further clarification if one wants to align this with the CVSS score.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that Siemens has released updates to correct this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-CAN-11986 and ZDI-CAN-11994 by the Zero Day Initiative.
*   The affected products are Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization, all versions prior to V13.1.0.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow)
