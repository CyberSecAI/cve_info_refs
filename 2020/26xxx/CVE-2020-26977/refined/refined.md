Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26977:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability occurs in Firefox for Android when attempting to connect to a website using an unresponsive port. Due to the way the browser handles the initial URL load and subsequent errors, the URL bar can display the original domain while the tab's content is controlled by the attacker. This happens when a new window (tab) is opened, and the URL of the new tab is immediately set to the attacker-specified URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **URL Spoofing:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to spoof the URL displayed in the address bar. While the tab's content is controlled by the attacker, the URL bar displays the original, legitimate domain, misleading the user about the site they are visiting.
*   **Incorrect Handling of Initial URL:** The browser was incorrectly trusting the initial URL passed during a new tab creation. It was not waiting for the actual content to load before updating the URL bar.
*   **Suppression of about:blank:** Firefox was suppressing the display of `about:blank` during initial tab load to avoid a perceived UI glitch. This action inadvertently hid the correct URL during the attempted connection to the invalid port.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing and Deception:** Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to create convincing phishing pages, as the displayed URL in the address bar will be the legitimate one, making users more likely to interact with the malicious content.
*   **Data Theft:** Users might enter sensitive information on what appears to be a trusted site (due to the spoofed URL) without knowing that the content is actually controlled by an attacker.
*  **Malware Distribution:** A malicious website could use the spoofed address bar to trick users into downloading and installing malicious applications or files, under the assumption they are dealing with a legitimate site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Website with Malicious Link:** An attacker could host a webpage with a link that, when clicked, opens a new tab and attempts to connect to a given domain on an invalid port. This triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Javascript/setTimeout:** The attack relies on the ability to open a new tab and then initiate a connection to a non-responsive port, while the original tab still has some control. The initial URL for the new tab is set by the attacker, not the site itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Website Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a website or be able to inject a malicious link on a webpage visited by the target.
*   **JavaScript knowledge:** The attack is achieved through JavaScript to open the new tab and set the initial URL along with the invalid port.
*   **Target Device:** The user needs to be using Firefox for Android.

**Additional Details from Bugzilla:**

*   The issue was fixed by removing the immediate setting of the URL for a new tab, which was caused by trusting a URL passed in by the opener tab. Instead the browser now waits for the `onLocationChange` callback to update the URL.
*   The vulnerability was specific to Firefox for Android and was not reproducible on desktop versions or on Chrome for Android.
*   The fix involved changes in the Android Components `WindowFeature.kt` file as well as a fix to not suppress the display of about:blank for parent sessions.
*   The fix was implemented in Firefox versions 84 and 85, with Firefox 83 being marked as wontfix.
*   The bug report contains a testcase in the form of an html file that demonstrates the issue.
*   This bug was classified as "sec-moderate"

In summary, CVE-2020-26977 allowed attackers to spoof the URL in the address bar of Firefox for Android by exploiting a vulnerability in the browser's handling of new tab URLs and connections to non-responsive ports, which made it possible to trick users into believing they are interacting with a legitimate site.
