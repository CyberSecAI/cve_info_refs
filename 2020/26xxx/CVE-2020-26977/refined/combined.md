Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 84

Announced
December 15, 2020
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 84

Reporter
AndrÃ© Bargull
Impact
critical
##### Description

When a BigInt was right-shifted the backing store was not properly cleared, allowing uninitialized memory to be read.

##### References

* [Bug 1679003](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1679003)

#### [#CVE-2020-26971: Heap buffer overflow in WebGL](#CVE-2020-26971)

Reporter
Omair, Abraruddin Khan
Impact
high
##### Description

Certain blit values provided by the user were not properly constrained leading to a heap buffer overflow on some video drivers.

##### References

* [Bug 1663466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26972: Use-After-Free in WebGL](#CVE-2020-26972)

Reporter
Brian Carpenter via the ASAN Nightly project
Impact
high
##### Description

The lifecycle of IPC Actors allows managed actors to outlive their manager actors; and the former must ensure that they are not attempting to use a dead actor they have a reference to. Such a check was omitted in WebGL, resulting in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1671382](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1671382)

#### [#CVE-2020-26973: CSS Sanitizer performed incorrect sanitization](#CVE-2020-26973)

Reporter
Kai Engert
Impact
high
##### Description

Certain input to the CSS Sanitizer confused it, resulting in incorrect components being removed. This could have been used as a sanitizer bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1680084](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1680084)

#### [#CVE-2020-26974: Incorrect cast of StyleGenericFlexBasis resulted in a heap use-after-free](#CVE-2020-26974)

Reporter
Pham Bao of VinCSS (Member of Vingroup)
Impact
high
##### Description

When `flex-basis` was used on a table wrapper, a `StyleGenericFlexBasis` object could have been incorrectly cast to the wrong type. This resulted in a heap user-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1681022](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1681022)

#### [#CVE-2020-26975: Malicious applications on Android could have induced Firefox for Android into sending arbitrary attacker-specified headers](#CVE-2020-26975)

Reporter
Pedro Oliveira
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a malicious application installed on the user's device broadcast an Intent to Firefox for Android, arbitrary headers could have been specified, leading to attacks such as abusing ambient authority or session fixation. This was resolved by only allowing certain safe-listed headers.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1661071](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661071)

#### [#CVE-2020-26976: HTTPS pages could have been intercepted by a registered service worker when they should not have been](#CVE-2020-26976)

Reporter
Andrew Sutherland
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a HTTPS pages was embedded in a HTTP page, and there was a service worker registered for the former, the service worker could have intercepted the request for the secure page despite the iframe not being a secure context due to the (insecure) framing.

 *Note: This issue only affects Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1676311](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1676311)

#### [#CVE-2020-26978: Internal network hosts could have been probed by a malicious webpage](#CVE-2020-26978)

Reporter
Samy Kamkar, Ben Seri, and Gregory Vishnepolsky
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Using techniques that built on the slipstream research, a malicious webpage could have exposed both an internal network's hosts as well as services running on the user's local machine.

##### References

* [Bug 1677047](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1677047)

#### [#CVE-2020-26979: When entering an address in the address or search bars, a website could have redirected the user before they were navigated to the intended url](#CVE-2020-26979)

Reporter
David SchÃ¼tz
Impact
low
##### Description

When a user typed a URL in the address bar or the search bar and quickly hit the enter key, a website could sometimes capture that event and then redirect the user before navigation occurred to the desired, entered address. To construct a convincing spoof the attacker would have had to guess what the user was typing, perhaps by suggesting it.

##### References

* [Bug 1641287, 1673299](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=1641287%2C1673299)

#### [#CVE-2020-35111: The proxy.onRequest API did not catch view-source URLs](#CVE-2020-35111)

Reporter
Yassine Tioual
Impact
low
##### Description

When an extension with the proxy permission registered to receive `<all_urls>`, the proxy.onRequest callback was not triggered for view-source URLs. While web content cannot navigate to such URLs, a user opening View Source could have inadvertently leaked their IP address.

##### References

* [Bug 1657916](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1657916)

#### [#CVE-2020-35112: Opening an extension-less download may have inadvertently launched an executable instead](#CVE-2020-35112)

Reporter
Samuel Attard via the Chrome Security Team
Impact
low
##### Description

If a user downloaded a file lacking an extension on Windows, and then "Open"-ed it from the downloads panel, if there was an executable file in the downloads directory with the same name but with an executable extension (such as .bat or .exe) that executable would have been launched instead.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1661365](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661365)

#### [#CVE-2020-35113: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 84 and Firefox ESR 78.6](#CVE-2020-35113)

Reporter
Christian Holler
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developer Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 83 and Firefox ESR 78.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

I can't reproduce this on GVE, and in fact we never get a `facebook.com` URL at all in `onLocationChange()`. It's critical that Fenix *only* displays URLs delivered via `onLocationChange()` in the toolbar.

Sorry, we do eventually get a `https://www.facebook.com:1234/` in `onLocationChange()` once the connection times out and we get an error. That's expected.

First, we are getting an OPEN `WindowRequest`, which adds a new tab and dispatches an `AddTabAction` through the `SessionManager`. The `AddTabAction` uses `toTabSessionState` which codifies the initial URL (the Facebook URL) as the tab truth in the `ContentState`.

It then selects that tab, and since the tab has been selected and state changed, the `ToolbarPresenter` renders the new URL.

I propose removing the Android-Components `Session` `initialUrl` argument altogether, because it sounds like we should never be trusting URLs we pass in from our side. We should trust the `onLocationChange` callbacks after attempting a load of the initial URL.

Adding Sebastian from AC for feedback.

This seems to be related to us hiding the initial load of `about:blank`, that Gecko does:

<https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/master/components/browser/engine-gecko-nightly/src/main/java/mozilla/components/browser/engine/gecko/GeckoEngineSession.kt#L436-L441>

We did this to workaround issues with `about:blank` appearing briefly in the toolbar, looking like a UI glitch.

In this situation here, the page actually injects content into that `about:blank` page and the load of `facebook.com:1234` takes quite a while to timeout. If we'd stop suppressing the `about:blank` update then Fenix would behave like desktop and we'd display `about:blank` in the URL bar until the timeout, where we switch to `facebook.com:1234` and show the error page. However that would potentially re-introduce the UI glitch. Unfortunately we do not seem to be able to distinguish between the initial `about:blank` load and the state where there's actually content getting injected. As a potential workaround for this we could try disabling the `about:blank` check for sessions that have a parent. That may be the smallest possible patch?

(In reply to Emily Kager [:ekager] from [comment #7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1676311#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Spoof URL by connecting to an invalid port with a setTimeout call in the originating tab"))

> I propose removing the Android-Components `Session` `initialUrl` argument altogether, because it sounds like we should never be trusting URLs we pass in from our side. We should trust the `onLocationChange` callbacks after attempting a load of the initial URL.

Separating the "initial url to load" from the "content url" is an option too. But it will have a ripple effect on a lot of things and potentially cause regressions. I would like to look at all the options before this "heart surgery". :)

I started to look into Fennec source.. it doesn't reproduce in Fennec *and* we always have a URL for the tab - without the UI glitch happening afaik. Curious how this was solved there.

There are some edge cases where this does introduce other undesired behaviors (like showing `about:blank` when manually entering a URL and staying on `about:blank` when stopping the load).

There might be an easier solution after all. This problem only exists when opening a new window (link with a target), where we set the URL of the new tab to the given URL immediately. There's absolutely no need to do this, since we are not initiating the load - Gecko(View) does it.

Related code:

<https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/master/components/feature/tabs/src/main/java/mozilla/components/feature/tabs/WindowFeature.kt#L46-L62>

Christian wrote WindowFeature and we looked at the various scenarios and this seems to be a viable option. I'll attach a patch for discussion.

I forgot to enable interception for non-secure contexts if the `dom.serviceWorkers.testing.enabled` pref is enabled.

If I'm reading the blame correctly, this is a regression from [bug 1629882](/show_bug.cgi?id=1629882 "RESOLVED FIXED - COEP requires a secure context")? If so, do we need to backport this to ESR78 also?

It's not related, as far as I can tell. I think it was there all along until a tweet brought this to our attention. We should backport it, I'll check if it applies cleanly to ESR78.

What ever happened to this? Did it apply cleanly? Was it fixed? not fixed but should be? Turned out to not affect ESR78?
