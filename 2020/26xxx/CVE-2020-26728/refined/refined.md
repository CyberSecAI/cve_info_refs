Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the Tenda router's web server (httpd). Specifically, the `guestuser` parameter in a POST request to `/goform/SetSambaCfg` is directly passed to the `doSystem` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The direct passing of user-supplied input to `doSystem` allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands on the router.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The web server fails to sanitize or validate the `guestuser` parameter, which is a critical security flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router, potentially gaining full control.
- **Device Compromise:** This allows for a range of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, botnet recruitment, and modification of device configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specifically crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/SetSambaCfg` endpoint.
- **`guestuser` Parameter:** The malicious command is injected through the `guestuser` parameter in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface. This typically means being on the same local network or having the router exposed to the internet.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs a valid `password` cookie to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- **HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests with specific parameters.

**Additional Details:**
- The attacker needs to send at least two requests. The first one sets the `guestuser` parameter, and the second one triggers the command execution using the previously set value.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) uses `wget` to demonstrate command execution, but any shell command could potentially be executed.
- The vulnerability affects Tenda AC9, AC15, and AC18 routers, specifically versions V15.03.06.42\_multi(AC9), V15.03.05.19(6318)\_CN(AC9), and earlier.
