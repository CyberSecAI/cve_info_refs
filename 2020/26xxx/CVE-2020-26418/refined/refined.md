Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-26418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is a memory leak within the Kafka dissector of Wireshark. This leak occurs due to improper validation of the decompression size when decoding Kafka packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Memory leak: The Kafka dissector fails to properly manage memory during decompression.
- Improper validation: The dissector does not adequately check the size of decompressed data, leading to excessive memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): A remote attacker can exploit the memory leak by sending specially crafted Kafka packets, either via a captured pcap file or through network traffic, that, when processed, cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources and crash.
- Excessive CPU usage: Malformed packets can lead to Wireshark consuming a large amount of CPU resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Malformed network packets: Attacker injects malformed Kafka packets onto the network that is being captured by Wireshark.
- Malformed packet trace files:  Attacker convinces someone to open a malicious packet capture file (pcap).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to inject specifically crafted packets into a network that is being analyzed by Wireshark.
- Alternatively, the attacker could convince someone to open a maliciously crafted packet capture file.
- No specific privileges are required to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue is specifically related to the Apache Kafka dissector within Wireshark.
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 3.4.0 and 3.2.0 through 3.2.8.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Wireshark versions 3.4.1 and 3.2.9.
- The fix includes a check on the decompression size to prevent excessive memory allocation. A maximum decompression size of 50 MB is introduced, triggering an error if it's exceeded.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 are not affected as they don't include the vulnerable Kafka dissector.
