{
  "CVE-2020-26164": {
    "Description": "In kdeconnect-kde (aka KDE Connect) before 20.08.2, an attacker on the local network could send crafted packets that trigger use of large amounts of CPU, memory, or network connection slots, aka a Denial of Service attack.",
    "Root cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities related to handling network packets and connections without proper limits or validation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input validation on received data, leading to excessive resource consumption.",
      "No limits on the number of TCP connections, allowing for connection exhaustion.",
      "No limits on processed UDP broadcasts, leading to memory exhaustion.",
       "Vulnerable to amplification attacks by sending forged IP addresses in UDP broadcasts.",
      "Unprotected pairing process allowing for session hijacking and denial of service.",
      "Improper handling of SSL verification errors during initial connections."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive CPU, memory, and network resource usage.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted UDP broadcast packets sent on the local network.",
      "Crafted TCP packets sent to the target system.",
      "Establishing multiple TCP connections to the target system.",
      "Hijacking of the pairing process."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Attacker must be on the same local network as the target device.",
      "Attacker can send and receive network packets on the local network."
    ],
    "Additional Information": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted network packets or by establishing a high number of connections.",
      "The vulnerabilities can lead to 100% CPU usage, high memory allocation and network resource exhaustion.",
       "The pairing process is vulnerable, allowing attackers to interrupt or hijack connections.",
      "Self-signed certificates used by kdeconnect are not properly validated during initial connections.",
       "The 'deviceName' field of 'kdeconnect.identity' messages leaks usernames and hostnames.",
       "The issue was fixed in kdeconnect-kde version 20.08.2",
       "Multiple commits from the KDE project address the different vulnerabilities (listed in the original report)"
    ]
