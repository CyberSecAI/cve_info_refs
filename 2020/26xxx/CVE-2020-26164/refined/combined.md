This is our aim as security team. We are currently still discussing with
the community how to achieve a good solution that removes the attack
surface by default but enables interested users to easily access the
application.

Well put. Exactly my thinking.

From KDE Community Wiki

This is the community page for **KDE Connect**. Feel free to edit it! It should contain useful and up-to-date resources for both users and developers.

## What is KDE Connect?

**KDE Connect** is a project that enables all your devices to communicate with each other. Here are a few things **KDE Connect** can do:

* Receive your phone notifications on your desktop computer and reply to messages
* Control music playing on your desktop from your phone
* Use your phone as a remote control for your desktop
* Run predefined commands on your PC from connected devices. See the list of [example commands](https://userbase.kde.org/KDE_Connect/Tutorials/Useful_commands) for more details.
* Check your phones battery level from the desktop
* Ring your phone to help finding it
* Share files and links between devices
* Browse your phone from the desktop
* Control the desktop's volume from the phone

To achieve this, **KDE Connect**:

* implements a secure communication protocol over the network, and allows any developer to create plugins on top of it.
* Has a component that you install on your desktop.
* Has a KDE Connect client app you run on your phone.

This video from 2013 demonstrates some other cool features: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkCFngNmsh0>

More info at [Albert Vaka's](http://albertvaka.wordpress.com) or [Nico's](http://nicolasfella.wordpress.com) blog.

## Installation and Usage

Please see the **KDE Connect** [Userbase page](https://userbase.kde.org/KDEConnect) for detailed information on the different ways **KDE Connect** can be installed and used.

## Build KDE Connect from source

KDE Connect is a free/ libre open source software, being developed for over 8 years now.

### Linux Desktop

**KDE Connect** can be built directly from source using CMake and system-installed dependencies.

Alternatively, you may use a meta-build system like [kdesrc-build](https://kdesrc-build.kde.org/) or [Craft](https://community.kde.org/Craft/),
both of which have the added benefit of leaving your linux installation unaffected and containing the dev files to a single directory.

#### Using a meta-build system

* Craft is a cross-platform meta-build system that works quite well on Windows and Linux for KDE Connect devel.
  + Set up Craft using [this link](https://community.kde.org/Craft/Linux/), and then visit [here](https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect/Build_Craft) for instructions to use Craft to build KDE Connect.
* kdesrc-build is a meta-build system that is used by many long-term KDE developers as their daily driver for KDE devel on Linux. See [here](https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect/Build_kdesrc-build) for comprehensive build instructions.

#### Without a meta-build system

KDE Connect uses CMake as its build system, which will tell you if you are missing any dependencies.
See [here](https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect/Build_Linux) for build instructions.

### Windows

KDE Connect is officially supported on Windows.
See [here](https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect/Build_Windows) for build instructions.

### Android

The most convenient dev-flow way is to pass the [project URL](https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-android) to **Android Studio**, build the app and install it to your phone.
Remember to uninstall any already-installed KDE Connect app from your target Android device.
You can also build the android app through CLI using gradle.

You can also run the app in an emulated Android device for devel. See [/Android\_Emulator/ here] for instructions.

### iOS

Since [KDE Connect iOS](https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-ios) is being developed in native frameworks, a recent version of Xcode is required to build the app. However, due to the special entitlements used in the complete version of KDE Connect, it can only be signed by the KDE e.V. development team. A wiki page is currently being written with information on how building and distribution would work and the possible resources available to contributors without macOS access.

### MacOS

**KDE Connect** works fairly well on macOS, however there is no official version as of yet. See [here](https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect/Build_MacOS) for build instructions.

You can get the Nightly Build from the [Binary Factory](https://binary-factory.kde.org/view/MacOS/job/kdeconnect-kde_Nightly_macos/).

### Special Mentions

Special instructions for specfic topics.

#### Plasmoid Development

You can use `plasmawindowed` to easily run the Plasmoid (even on non-KDE environments).

Set up your dev environment as above, then run `make install`, then run `plasmawindowed org.kde.kdeconnect` to launch the Plasmoid and see your changes.

#### Mobile-Friendly QML App

The kdeconnect-app component of the desktop version is suitable for mobile Linux environments, too.

#### Desktop SMS Messaging App

**KDE Connect** has an SMS messaging app which lets you type and view SMS messages from your computer.
It supports basic features and works correctly most of the time.
If you are interested in trying or developing it, you can build it from source.
It is automatically built as part of the rest of **KDE Connect** and is output as 'kdeconnect-sms'.

## Development

**KDE Connect** is a perfect project to start contributing to KDE. You'll need a basic understanding of programming concepts, the rest can be learned by doing. Experience with Android or Qt is beneficial, but not needed.

We have a group to discuss development. You can access it from [Matrix](https://go.kde.org/matrix/#/#kdeconnect:kde.org) or [Libera IRC network](https://libera.chat) (#kdeconnect). If you cannot find the correct room on Matrix, it might help if you first join the [KDE Matrix Space](https://go.kde.org/matrix/#/!OTxETzuhBDbnPqBqbP:kde.org). You can read more about KDE's use of Matrix [here](https://community.kde.org/Matrix) Feel free to ask any development-related questions there. We also have a [mailing list](https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kdeconnect).

All patches are submitted on Gitlab. The Android repository is [here](https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-android) and the C++ Desktop repository is [here](https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-kde). Be sure to select the most relevant template. You don't need to assign any reviewers, the developers are subscribed to notifications. Should this be your first patch, it's good to know that it might take some time before your patch is reviewed (we all work on **KDE Connect** in our free time), and you'll probably have to make some changes a couple of times. That's not because you're new, that's what happens for all reviews (even for long-time contributors).

There are a couple of tasks marked as Junior Jobs on our [workboard](https://phabricator.kde.org/project/board/159/). Those have some extra information on how to approach them that help you get started.

### Setting up KDE Connect Repository for Development

**KDE Connect** is actually composed of two repositories; one for the Android implementation and one for the C++ (Desktop) implementation. You can have a local clone of both on your computer and the steps to set them up are the same. For these directions, I will use the C++ repository, but if you want the Android repository, just replace every instance of 'kdeconnect-kde' with 'kdeconnect-android'

1. Fork the repository
   * With your web browser, open the Web GUI to KDE Connect's GitLab: <https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-kde>
   * If you are not already, sign in with your KDE identity by clicking the "Sign In" button in the top left
   * Click the "Fork" button, near the top right
   * Wait for the forking to complete
2. Clone your fork
   * Open your new fork in the GitLab web GUI
   * Click the "Clone" button in the top right
   * Select the method of cloning
     + I recommend SSH. This will require you add an SSH public key to your KDE GitLab account.
     + An HTTPS clone will require you to log in with your KDE Identity credentials to push changes.
   * In the folder you want to clone, do 'git clone <cloning path from above>'

You are all set up! See the optional steps for ways to make life easier.

#### Set up second remote (Optional)

Having a second remote allows you to have your local 'master' branch track the upstream kdeconnect-kde master branch, so you can easily get all the latest changes.

These steps assume you are using command-line git. If you are using a GUI tool, the steps will be different, but the ideas will be the same.

1. On the command line, change to your local repository clone
2. Execute:

```
# Note that we use HTTPS cloning here so that you don't need a verified account to pull changes!
git remote add upstream https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-kde.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b upstream-master --track upstream/master

```

1. Now whenever there are new changes upstream, simply pull the upstream-master branch, then merge or rebase your local branches onto those changes!

### Development tips

#### Restarting the daemon

Whenever you do a change to KDE Connect you need to restart the daemon for the change to take effect.

```
killall kdeconnectd
build/bin/kdeconnectd

```
#### Debug Logging

By default, most Linux distributions tell Qt to restrict what logging you will see. You can control this using the QT\_LOGGING\_RULES variable. Running something like the below command will show most all logging.

```
export QT_LOGGING_RULES="*.debug=true; qt.*.debug=false"

```
#### DBus inspection

The daemon communicates with various UI components (Plasmoid, CLI, Indicator etc.) over DBus. QDbusViewer allows inspecting the DBus interface provided by the daemon which can be incredibly useful for debugging.

### Running KDE Connect on an emulator

How to setup running **KDE Connect** on an emulator is described here [Android\_Emulator](/KDEConnect/Android_Emulator "KDEConnect/Android Emulator")

## Release Process

The following sections describe how to release a new version KDE Connect

### C++ Application

#### Tarballs

Tarball releases are handled automatically through KDE's release process. These are typically consumed by downstream distros in their release process.

#### Windows Store

1. This should ideally be done at the same time as the .exe upload, using the build from the same version.
2. Do some QA on a build you would like to release. Navigate to the [repository pipelines](https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-kde/-/pipelines), grab the latest signed \*-sideload.appx of a release (not master) build you would like to test, and put it through the paces. Make sure all the plugins work, and make sure the UI elements look right.
3. Use the microsoftstore pipeline step to upload the .appx to the Microsoft store.
4. Open the [Microsoft Store partner center](https://aka.ms/submitwindowsapp) and login with your `@kdeev.onmicrosoft.com` credentials. If you don't have access to the partner center, you need to file a sysadmin ticket, as described [here](https://develop.kde.org/docs/packaging/windows/microsoftstore/publishing/).
5. Update the release notes for the new submissions. (Store listing -> Languages -> English)
6. Approve the new release.

#### Windows EXE

1. This should ideally be done at the same time as the Windows Store upload, using the build from the same version.
2. Grab the \*.exe and the \*.exe.sha256 from the build. Install it, test that it works.
3. Upload the .exe, .exe.sha256, -dbg.7z, and -dbg.7z.sha256 to the release network, as described here: <https://community.kde.org/ReleasingSoftware#Uploading_the_Tar>
4. File a sysadmin ticket, and request that the .exe and -dbg.7z files from the build you tested be uploaded to the stable download path, like <https://download.kde.org/stable/release-service/23.08.0/windows/>
5. Once the download files are in the mirror network, update the appstream data like <https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-kde/-/commit/5639905b8dc3c36675bd8c042db7e2849023f6dc>
6. Follow the steps here to upload to the mirror network: <https://community.kde.org/ReleasingSoftware#Uploading_the_Tar>

### Android

Before making an Android release we have to:

* Bump the version name and number in the [AndroidManifest.xml file](https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-android/-/blob/master/AndroidManifest.xml).
* Create an annotated version tag on git (the name should start with "v").

#### Google Play Store

We build and sign the APK packages for the Play Store ourselves (we don't use Google's App Bundles which get signed by Google). To release on the Play Store you need two things:

* Access to the KDE organization on the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console).
* The KDE Connect signing key and passphrase.

We build an APK from a git version tag using Android Studio (Build > Generate Signed Bundle/APK and then select APK) and upload it to the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console) through the web UI.

#### FDroid

The [FDroid package](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp/) is not built by us. It is built and signed by the FDroid build server. Version information is stored in a [metadata file on FDroid’s Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/blob/master/metadata/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp.yml). We don't update the metadata file manually for new releases, though.

FDroid periodically (every 2-3 days) scans our git repo and if there's a new version tagged it will update the metadata and trigger a build automatically. Each build attempt produces logs which can be checked to debug issues.

The FDroid community is quite active and they usually reply fast when we open an issue or a MR (eg: to update the app description or some other metadata).

Thank you for your work on this, and for publishing so much detail!

Will kdeconnectd no longer be active by default in openSUSE?  I hope so.
Merely fixing the known issues doesn't address the fact that this poses
unjustified risk for most people.

Don't brute-force reading the socket

The package will arrive eventually, and dataReceived will be emitted.
Otherwise we just end up calling dataReceived to no end.

Thanks Matthias Gerstner <mgerstner@suse.de> for reporting this.

 issues in kdeconnectd network daemon

Hi,

On Tue, Oct 13, 2020 at 02:29:12PM +0200, Matthias Gerstner wrote:
> following is a security review report concerning kdeconnect [1].

this is an amendment to my original report. Upstream wanted to keep this
private until they had something to address it. Originally I raised the
following additional concern:

    ## General Observations and Recommendations

    ### Pairing Procedure

    The pairing procedure currently seems lacking. The GUI component only presents
    the friendly 'deviceName' to identify peer devices, which is completely under
    attacker control. Furthermore the 'deviceName' is transmitted in cleartext in
    UDP broadcast messages for all other nodes in the network segment to see.
    Therefore malicious devices can attempt to confuse users by requesting a
    pairing under the same 'deviceName' to gain access to a system.

    I strongly suggest to introduce a secure procedure here, like displaying the
    certificate fingerprint to the user.

Upstream addresses this now [1]. A sha256 fingerprint of the
concatenated public keys of the two involved certificates is displayed.
I'm not completely happy with the chosen solution, because in the
initial popup only a prefix of 8 hex digits of the fingerprint is
displayed. The full fingerprint is only reachable via an additional
"view key" button. There are no additional instructions for the end user
and no explanation about the severity of trusting a device. At least in
theory it is now possible to do a proper peer device verification.

Other discussed approaches to make the verification more user friendly
and/or more secure would have been:

- displaying a randomart image in the fashion of ssh-keygen.
- scanning a QR code displayed on the PC end using the kdeconnect
  Android app.
- requiring the user to enter (at least part of) the fingerprint on the
  PC end to force proper user interaction. Since the pairing procedure
  should not occur very often and given the importance of verifying
  device identity this would have been justified.

Please - Do not talk to other people about this unless they're involved in fixing the issue - Do not make this bug public - Do not submit this into OBS (e.g. fix Leap) until this bug becomes public (e.g. no EMBARGOED tag on the header) - Consult security team if you think that the issue is public and the bug is still Embargoed - Please be aware that the SUSE:SLE-15-SP3:GA codestream is available via OBS. This means that you can't submit security fixes for embargoed issues to this GA codestream under development until they become public. In doubt please talk to us on IRC (#security), RocketChat (#security) or send us an e-mail. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1176268#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-09-08 11:43:34 UTC  ``` Internal CRD: 2020-12-07 preliminary ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1176268#c3)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-09-08 11:47:54 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 841471](attachment.cgi?id=841471) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=841471&action=edit) tarball containing reproducer script ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1176268#c5)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-09-28 10:59:40 UTC  ``` The preliminary publication date for these issues as communicated by upstream will be 2020-10-03.

Please - Do not talk to other people about this unless they're involved in fixing the issue - Do not make this bug public - Do not submit this into OBS (e.g. fix Leap) until this bug becomes public (e.g. no EMBARGOED tag on the header) - Consult security team if you think that the issue is public and the bug is still Embargoed - Please be aware that the SUSE:SLE-15-SP3:GA codestream is available via OBS. This means that you can't submit security fixes for embargoed issues to this GA codestream under development until they become public. In doubt please talk to us on IRC (#security), RocketChat (#security) or send us an e-mail. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1176268#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-09-08 11:43:34 UTC  ``` Internal CRD: 2020-12-07 preliminary ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1176268#c3)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-09-08 11:47:54 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 841471](attachment.cgi?id=841471) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=841471&action=edit) tarball containing reproducer script ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1176268#c5)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-09-28 10:59:40 UTC  ``` The preliminary publication date for these issues as communicated by upstream will be 2020-10-03.

KDE Project Security Advisory
=============================
Title: KDE Connect: packet manipulation can be exploited in a Denial of Service attack
Risk Rating: Important
CVE: CVE-2020-26164
Versions: kdeconnect <= 20.08.1
Author: Albert Vaca Cintora
Date: 2 October 2020
Overview
========
An attacker on your local network could send maliciously crafted packets to other hosts running
kdeconnect on the network, causing them to use large amounts of CPU, memory or network
connections, which could be used in a Denial of Service attack within the network.
Impact
======
Computers that run kdeconnect are susceptible to DoS attacks from the local network.
Workaround
==========
We advise you to stop KDE Connect when on untrusted networks like those on airports or conferences.
Since kdeconnect is dbus activated it is relatively hard to make sure it stays stopped so the brute
force approach is to uninstall the kdeconnect package from your system and then run
kquitapp5 kdeconnectd
Just install the package again once you're back in a trusted network.
Solution
========
KDE Connect 20.08.2 patches several code paths that could result in a DoS.
You can apply these patches on top of 20.08.1:

Subject: kdeconnect: CVE-2020-26164: multiple security issues in kdeconnectd
 network daemon

Hello list,

following is a security review report concerning kdeconnect [1].

[1]: <https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect>

# 1) Introduction

The SUSE security team noticed that a new network service service
`kdeconnectd` was active by default  in openSUSE Leap 15.2 listening on TCP
and UDP port 1716. `kdeconnectd` is started automatically in the context of
any KDE session and runs with the privileges of the logged in user.

`kdeconnectd` talks to an Android smartphone app. The use cases are, among
others:

- sharing the PC clipboard with the smartphone
- controlling the PC from the smartphone (running commands, controlling input)

I conducted an in-depth source code review to make sure that this new
application doesn't introduce remote security issues in default installations.
I looked into kdeconnect version 20.08.0. Any source code references stated in
this report relate to this version of the code base.

I only looked into the ethernet networking logic rooted in the source code
class `LanLinkProvider`. There is also a `BluetoothLinkProvider` that might be
affected by similar or additional issues as discussed in this report.

Unfortunately at the moment only the single CVE mentioned in the subject has
been assigned by upstream cumulatively for all the issues mentioned in this
report.

The upstream fixes meantioned in this report and in the upstream security
advisory [2] are available in the upstream version kdeconnect 20.08.2.

[2]: <https://kde.org/info/security/advisory-20201002-1.txt>

# 2) The `kdeconnect` Network Protocol

This section is only for readers that aren't already familiar with the
basics of the kdeconnect network protocol. Others may skip over to section 3.

`kdeconnectd` operates both on UDP port 1716 and on TCP port 1716 (possibly
also other TCP port numbers, see section 2.b for details) as a client and as a
server. The UDP port is used to send and receive broadcasts announcing
kdeconnect enabled nodes in the network segment. The TCP port is used to
establish individual node-to-node connections over which the actual
application logic is carried out.

As data exchange format JSON data structures are used.

## a) The UDP Broadcast Protocol

Upon startup `kdeconnectd` sends out a single cleartext broadcast datagram on
UDP port 1716 containing a JSON datastructure of type 'kdeconnect.identity'
resembling this one:

```
{
 'body': {'deviceId': '_bd5ad7ad_43d1_434b_ae3a_5b5af224a513_',
          'deviceName': 'user@...t',
          'deviceType': 'desktop',
          'incomingCapabilities': ['kdeconnect.lock',
                                   'kdeconnect.mousepad.request',
                                   <...>
                                   'kdeconnect.mpris'],
          'outgoingCapabilities': ['kdeconnect.notification.action',
                                   <...>
                                   'kdeconnect.mpris'],
          'protocolVersion': 7,
          'tcpPort': 1716},
 'id': '1599051054076',
 'type': 'kdeconnect.identity'
}
```

This broadcast message also contains a tcp port number (by default 1716)
announcing at which TCP port `kdeconnectd` is reachable for the main
application protocol.

When `kdeconnectd` receives a broadcast like this from another node on the
network it actively attempts to connect to this node on the announced TCP
port (lanlinkprovider.cpp:236).

## b) The TCP Application Protocol

`kdeconnectd` listens for incoming TCP connections on port 1716. In
case this port is already in use, the daemon attempts to find a higher free
port number in the range [1716, 1764], which is probably also the reason why
the actual port number used is announced in the UDP broadcast messages.

Furthermore the daemon actively connects to the TCP ports announced by other
devices in the network via UDP broadcasts.

The initiator of the TCP connection (client side) initially sends a cleartext
message containing a JSON datastructure of type 'kdeconnect.identity', just
like the one transmitted via UDP broadcasts as described in the previous
section. Afterwards an SSL connection is established (lanlinkprovider.cpp:393
ff for the server side, lanlinkprovider.cpp:282 ff for the client side).

The SSL connection is based on untrusted, self-signed certificates used on
both ends. For yet unknown peers `kdeconnectd` ignores any SSL validation
errors and establishes the SSL connection nonetheless. These connections are
treated as untrusted by `kdeconnectd`. Only trusted devices can access the
actual kdeconnect features of the PC host.

To establish trust, a pairing process can be triggered from either side of
the connection. On the PC side untrusted devices are displayed in a list of
the kdeconnect graphical widget. Each device is identified by a free form
string ('deviceName' as used in the 'kdeconnect.identity' message used in
UDP broadcasts). A user can actively trigger a pairing request for any of the
listed untrusted devices. Then `kdeconnectd` will send out a 'kdeconnect.pair'
message to the peer device that looks like this:

```
{'body': {'pair': True}, 'id': '1599053939750', 'type': 'kdeconnect.pair'}
```

There is no further communication or authentication required, the device will
be treated as trusted by `kdeconnectd` from this point on forward.

A remote device can also actively trigger a pairing request by sending a
message of type 'kdeconnect.pair' to the host PC. In this case the trust is
established via an interactive graphical popup that is displayed in the PC
user's session that asks the user whether to authorize or reject the pairing
request. The free form identification string ('deviceName') will be displayed
in the popup. Once the user clicks on "Accept" the device is treated as
trusted from this point on forward.

`kdeconnectd` will store the self-signed SSL certificate of trusted devices in
a local database (landevicelink.cpp:182). When a device using the same
'deviceId' is encountered later on, then the SSL connection is required to
verify against this locally stored certificate (lanlinkprovider.cpp:427,
lanlinkprovider.cpp:293). If this verification succeeds then the device will
be treated as trusted right away.

## 3) Security Issues

For reproducing some of the issues the accompanying script `kdeconnect.py` can
be used.

### a) Information Leak of Username and Hostname

The 'kdeconnect.identity' message is always transmitted in cleartext either in
UDP broadcast messages or as initial TCP message before the SSL handshake is
started. The default 'deviceName' field of this message used by `kdeconnectd`
is of the form `<user>@<host>`, which leaks information about the logged in
user and the local hostname of the machine. This functionality can be used to:

- enumerate all machines in the network segment that have active KDE sessions
- enumerate the usernames of all these sessions
- the knowledge of the username and hostname could be used to attack other
  network services like SSH or to use them in social engineering attacks

#### Upstream Fix

<https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-kde/-/commit/b279c52101d3f7cc30a26086d58de0b5f1c547fa>

### b) Use after Free in LanLinkProvider::connectError()

In lanlinkprovider.cpp:255 an explicit deletion of the socket object is
performed, if an outgoing TCP connection failed:

```
delete socket;
```

The correct way would be to call `QObject::deleteLater()` to cause deferred
deletion. This causes a race condition, because `QSslSocket::connectToHost()`
might not yet have finished running when the socket object is already deleted
in LanLinkProvider::connectError(). This can result in a segmentation fault.
As usual with "use after free" issues, further unspecified impact is possible.

#### Reproducer

```
# this should crash any reachable `kdeconnectd` in the network segment pretty quickly
# specify only a specific host IP instead of 255.255.255.255 if you want to
# avoid affecting the whole network segment.
$ ./kdeconnect.py --send-bcast 255.255.255.255 --deviceid some_new_device --broadcast-DoS
```

#### Upstream Fix

<https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-kde/-/commit/d35b88c1b25fe13715f9170f18674d476ca9acdc>

### c) 100 % CPU loop reachable via SocketLineReader

After an SSL session is established on a TCP connection, the TCP input data
processing is handed over to a type `SocketLineReader`, a member of the
`LanDeviceLink` type (lanlinkprovider.cpp:537).

`SocketLineReader::dataReceived()` contains a bug when a message without
newline termination is sent by the peer:

```
    while (m_socket->canReadLine()) {
        // ...
    }

    //If we still have things to read from the socket, call dataReceived again
    //We do this manually because we do not trust readyRead to be emitted again
    //So we call this method again just in case.
    if (m_socket->bytesAvailable() > 0) {
        QMetaObject::invokeMethod(this, "dataReceived", Qt::QueuedConnection);
        return;
    }
```

This causes an infinite signal processing loop resulting in 100 % CPU load in
`kdeconnectd`. To trigger this, the peer only needs to send some TCP data
without a terminating newline character. This only works after the initial
'kdenetwork.identity' packet has been exchanged and after the SSL handshake
has completed.

#### Reproducer

```
# this will cause the remote `kdeconnectd` to end up with 100 % CPU load.

# add a suitable kdeconnectd remote IP address here
REMOTE_IP=a.b.c.d

### d) Lack of DoS Protection Measures

The `kdeconnectd` code doesn't contain any kind of protection measures against
denial of service attacks:

#### i) No Upper Limit on Message Sizes

There is no upper limit on the size of messages received over TCP, the
`LanLinkProvider` simply tries to read a newline terminated message
(lanlinkprovider.cpp:383). The underyling QTcpSocket implementation infinitely
reads incoming data and appends it to its internal buffer (a maximum buffer
size is not specified).  Thus if an unauthenticated TCP peer is sending a
infinitely long message without a newline byte appearing, the `kdeconnectd`
will continously allocate memory.

##### Reproducer
```
# this will cause the remote `kdeconnectd` to end up with 100 % CPU and
# an increasingly high amount of memory allocation, until an out of memory
# situation occurs.

# add a suitable kdeconnectd remote IP address here
$ REMOTE_IP=a.b.c.d
$ ./kdeconnect.py --connect-tcp $REMOTE_IP --send-overlong-tcp-message
```

##### Upstream Fix

<https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-kde/-/commit/b496e66899e5bc9547b6537a7f44ab44dd0aaf38>

#### ii) No Upper Limit on Parallel TCP Connections

There is no limit on the number of TCP connections accepted in parallel
and no timeout for unresponsive TCP connections. Therefore unauthenticated
clients of `kdeconnectd` can simply open TCP connections without
transmitting any data. This will cause file descriptor exhaustion and also
100 % CPU load in `kdeconnectd`.

##### Reproducer

```
# When this is finished with creating > 1000 TCP connections you should see
# a lot of open socket file descriptors on the host running `kdeconnectd`
# user $ ls -l /proc/`pidof kdeconnectd`/fd
#
# you should also see high CPU load caused by kdeconnectd

# add a suitable kdeconnectd remote IP address here
$ REMOTE_IP=a.b.c.d
$ ./kdeconnect.py --perform-tcp-connect-DoS $REMOTE_IP
```

<https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-kde/-/commit/5310eae85dbdf92fba30375238a2481f2e34943e>

#### iii) No Limit on Processed UDP Broadcasts

Also on the UDP broadcast side there are no limits to processing incoming
'kdeconnect.identity' messages. By using different 'deviceId' values
`kdeconnectd` will make a unique entry in an internal QMap data structure
(red-black tree based) for each broadcast message received and attempt an
outgoing TCP connect. Sending a high amount of broadcast messages will cause
high CPU load, high memory allocation, high amount of TCP traffic and will
finally end in an out of memory situation on the host running `kdeconnectd`.

##### Upstream Fix

<https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-kde/-/commit/66c768aa9e7fba30b119c8b801efd49ed1270b0a>

#### iv) Possible Amplification Attack

`kdeconnectd` actively attempts to establish a TCP connection upon reception
of a UDP broadcast (see section 2.a). This can be used as an amplification
vector to perform a dedicated DoS attack against some other host in the same
network segment. If a larger number of hosts running `kdeconnectd` are
available in the network then a single attacker can send a broadcast message
with a forged IP sender address (IP spoofing). All hosts receiving this
broadcast that run `kdeconnectd` will then attempt to connect to the forged IP
address, causing high load for this IP address. If repeated quickly this can
be used to overload the target host and/or the network segment.

### e) Possibility to Trigger Arbitrary Outgoing TCP Connections in `kdeconnectd`

`kdeconnectd` actively attempts to connect to the TCP ports advertised in UDP
broadcast messages (as explained in section 2.a). This is a bit of a peculiar
behaviour with a high degree of freedom for attackers. Since the UDP broadcast
message is unauthenticated, IP address spoofing can be applied. An
unauthenticated remote attacker can cause `kdeconnectd` to connect to an
arbitrary IP address in the same network segment on an arbitrary TCP port.

`kdeconnectd` will then send the 'kdeconnect.identity' message to this
ip/port. It is difficult to say what the security implications of this are.
The following items come to mind:

- it can confuse other network services on other hosts, possibly create log
  messages there. These other hosts may not even be reachable by the attacker
  due to firewall rules.
- by observing the resulting network traffic an attacker might get knowledge
  about the existence of other hosts or network services on other hosts
  if the host running `kdeconnectd` is treated differently by involved
  firewalls than the attacker.
- if mechanisms like `fail2ban` are used on other hosts in the network then it
  might be possible to add the host running `kdeconnectd` to a blacklist on
  some other machine, by hitting a maximum (connections / per time) limit.

##### Upstream Fix

### f) Pairing DoS

The successfully established pairing of a legitimate device can be interrupted
by another unauthorized party. To do this the attacker only needs to connect
to `kdeconnectd` using the same 'deviceId' as the victim uses. This
information is readily available, because it is broadcasted in cleartext by
the legitimate device upon startup. Now when the attacker presents an
arbitrary mismatching SSL certificate, the `kdeconnectd` will unpair the
victim's device unconditionally (lanlinkprovider.cpp:352).

#### Reproducer

- In one shell perform a successful pairing against a host running `kdeconnectd`:

```
# add a suitable kdeconnectd remote IP address here
REMOTE_IP=a.b.c.d
$ ./kdeconnect.py --connect-tcp $REMOTE_IP --deviceid legit_device
[...]
Do you want to (re-)pair? (y/n)
y
```

- Accept the pairing request on the host running `kdeconnectd` by clicking
  "Accept" in the popup dialog. After this you should receive a pairing
  confirmation message in the shell:

```
{'body': {'pair': True}, 'id': '1599139331920', 'type': 'kdeconnect.pair'}
```

- Now in a second shell emulate an attacking party:

```
$ ./kdeconnect.py --connect-tcp $REMOTE_IP --deviceid legit_device --localcert fakecerts/certificate.pem --privkey fakecerts/privateKey.pem
```

After this you should receive an unpair message in the first shell started
above:

```
{'body': {'pair': False}, 'id': '1599139445990', 'type': 'kdeconnect.pair'}
```

The victim's device will no longer be paired, any active applications within
`kdeconnectd` will be interrupted, upon next connection attempt a new pairing
will become necessary.

### g) SSL Validation Checks are not Applied During Initial Connection

`kdeconnectd` requires the peer SSL certificate's CN (common name) in the
Subject field to match the 'deviceId' transmitted in the 'kdeconnect.identity'
message (lanlinkprovider.cpp:479). The reason for this requirement is unclear
to me since both, the peer's SSL certificate as well as the peer's deviceId
are under attacker control.

When an unpaired device (see pairing process described in section 2.b)
connects to `kdeconnectd` then all SSL verification errors are ignored
(lanlinkprovider.cpp:301,435). An unpaired device can then initiate the
pairing process. If it succeeds and the user accepts the pairing then the same
TCP connection and same SSL session will continue to be used with the peer
now considered to be trusted. No SSL validation will be performed.

Only during a follow-up connection attempt by the device will SSL validation
errors be detected. This might also affect the cipher requirements setup in
`LanLinkProvider::configureSslSocket()`. If this is the case then a weak SSL
connection might be possible for the initial session of a trusted device.

I did not look very deep into this. Some tests I did acting as a QSslSocket
client towards `kdeconnectd` showed that the selection of ciphers set in
`QSslSocket::setCiphers()` has no influence at all on the SSL handshake and
resulting cipher selection. But I might have made a mistake or misunderstood
something about the related Qt API.

Recommendation: After successful pairing a new SSL session should be
established to verify the peer's certificate. Certain SSL errors should also
be handled for untrusted devices (pretty much all errors except the
SelfSignedCertificate error).

### h) Pairing Hijacking is Possible

If a second SSL session is established using the 'deviceId' of an already
connected device, then `kdeconnectd` will replace the existing SSL session by
the new SSL session (lanlinkprovider.cpp:535). As described in section 3.f,
the 'deviceId' is readily available from cleartext broadcast messages sent by
kdeconnect devices.

This situation allows an attacker to 'hijack' an ongoing pairing request. This
works the following way:

- legitimate device A connects via TCP to a host running `kdeconnectd`. The
  SSL session is established.
- device A sends a pairing request message 'kdeconnect.pair'.
- the host running `kdeconnectd` will present a popup to the interactive user
  asking for confirmation for the pairing request. The user will usually
  require at least a couple of seconds to confirm this request.
- malicious device B connects with the same deviceId as device A but using a
  different self-signed SSL certificate. The existing SSL session from
  legitimate device A will replaced by the new SSL session from the malicious
  device.
- the user accepts the pairing request
- `kdeconnectd` will now enter the SSL certificate of the malicious device
  into its local database and mark the malicious device as trusted. The
  interactive user will see no signs of a second device being present.
  `kdeconnectd` will immediately send out sensitive data like the host's
  clipboard contents to the malicious device.
- The malicious device should now also be able to run arbitrary commands on
  the host running `kdeconnectd` (but I did not test this).

#### Reproducer

- i) First start a pairing request in shell A (emulate the legitimate device):

```
# add a suitable kdeconnectd remote IP address here
REMOTE_IP=a.b.c.d
$ ./kdeconnect.py --connect-tcp $REMOTE_IP --deviceid legit_device
[...]
Do you want to (re-)pair? (y/n)
y
```

- ii) You should now see a popup in the hosts KDE session asking for confirmation.
Do *not* accept the pairing yet. Instead connect in shell B (emulate the
malicious device) without request a pairing:

```
$ ./kdeconnect.py --connect-tcp $REMOTE_IP --deviceid legit_device --localcert fakecerts/certificate.pem --privkey fakecerts/privateKey.pem
Do you want to (re-)pair? (y/n)
n
```

- iii) Now you need to confirm the original pairing request triggered in shell A in
the host's popup window. These steps have to be performed in less than 30
seconds, because there is a pairing timeout of 30 seconds implemented in
`kdeconnectd`.

If performed correctly then the connection in shell A should be terminated
with:

```
error occured The remote host closed the connection
```

while in shell B, without sending out a pairing request, a pairing
confirmation and clipboard contents (among other information) should appear:

```
{'body': {'pair': True}, 'id': '1599141347210', 'type': 'kdeconnect.pair'}
[...]
{'body': {'content': 'secret clipboard content', 'timestamp': 0},
 'id': '1599141347461',
 'type': 'kdeconnect.clipboard.connect'}
```
