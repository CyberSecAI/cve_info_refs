## Zammad Security Advisory ZAA-2020-16

This advisory details a medium severity vulnerability affecting Zammad versions 1.0.x up to 3.4.0, fixed in versions 3.4.1 and 3.5.0.

**Vulnerability:** Global search leaks Knowledge Base drafts to Knowledge Base readers.

**Root Cause:** The global search functionality did not properly filter search results based on Knowledge Base permissions.

**Weakness:** Insufficient permission checks on search results.

**Impact:** A logged-in user performing a global search might see Knowledge Base Answers in the search results that are in the "draft" state, even if they should not have permission to view drafts. This could lead to information disclosure.

**Attack Vector:** A user with "Knowledge Base reader" permissions performs a global search.

**Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with at least "Knowledge Base reader" permissions.

**Recommended Resolution:** Upgrade to Zammad version 3.4.1 or 3.5.0, or a later version.
