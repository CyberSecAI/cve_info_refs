Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2020-26995:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing SGI and RGB files. This inadequate validation leads to a write operation beyond the bounds of an allocated data structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: Specifically, the issue is a write past the end of an allocated data structure due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data lengths.
- Heap-based buffer overflow: One of the ZDI advisories mentions a heap-based buffer overflow specifically when processing PCX files, which is related to the same CVE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- Data extraction: In the case of an XML parsing issue, arbitrary files could be disclosed to attackers.
- Application crash: Vulnerabilities in other formats could lead to a crash of the affected applications.
- Information disclosure: One of the advisories indicates a use-after-free vulnerability in SGI file processing that can lead to sensitive information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious files: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted, malicious SGI, RGB or PCX file using the vulnerable software.
- Malicious pages: A user might also be tricked into visiting a webpage that automatically triggers the vulnerability if the browser can load the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and deliver a malicious file or page to the target user.
- User interaction is required, as the target user must either open the malicious file or visit the malicious page.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit this, and the attack can be conducted remotely.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization products.
- Siemens released version 13.1.0 to address this vulnerability, along with other related parsing vulnerabilities.
- The ZDI advisories further detail specific file types and vulnerability types related to this CVE, such as the SGI use-after-free vulnerability (ZDI-21-242) and the PCX file heap-based buffer overflow (ZDI-21-241).

The advisory from Siemens (SSA-622830) groups multiple file parsing vulnerabilities under a single advisory, including several out-of-bounds write, heap-based buffer overflow, and stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities. This is an umbrella advisory for several CVEs affecting multiple file formats.
