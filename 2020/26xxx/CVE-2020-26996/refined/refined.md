Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-26996:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CG4 files in Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: Specifically, the improper validation can lead to a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can potentially execute code within the context of the current process.
- Application crash: Opening a crafted file could lead to an application crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious file: The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted malicious CG4 file using the affected software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- User interaction: The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file.
- Local access:  The attacker needs to have the malicious file available in a location accessible to the targeted user. The CVSS vector indicates that the attack vector is local (AV:L), implying local file access is necessary for this exploit.
