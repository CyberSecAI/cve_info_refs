# FUEL CMS

FUEL CMS is a [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com) based content management system. To learn more about its features visit: <http://www.getfuelcms.com>

### Installation

To install FUEL CMS, copy the contents of this folder to a web accessible folder and browse to the index.php file. Next, follow the directions on the screen.

### Upgrade

If you have a current installation and are wanting to upgrade, there are a few things to be aware of. FUEL 1.4 uses CodeIgniter 3.x which includes a number of changes, the most prominent being the capitalization of controller and model names. Additionally it is more strict on reporting errors. FUEL 1.4 includes a script to help automate most (and maybe all) of the updates that may be required in your own fuel/application and installed advanced module code. It is recommended you run the following command using a different branch to test if you are running on Mac OSX or a Unix flavor operating system and using Git:
`php index.php fuel/installer/update`

### Documentation

To access the documentation, you can visit it [here](http://docs.getfuelcms.com).

### Bugs

## Abstract Advisory Information

An issue was discovered in Zoho Application Control Plus before version 10.0.511.

The Element Configuration feature (to configure elements included in the scope of elements managed by the product) allows an attacker to retrieve the entire list of the IP ranges and subnets configured in the product, and consequently obtain information about the cartography of the internal networks to which the product has access.

## [The Necessity of Cyber Crisis Exercises](https://excellium-services.com/2024/03/18/the-necessity-of-cyber-crisis-exercises/)

## The Expansion of Cyber Crises Today

Cyber crises represent a major challenge for organizations, regardless of their size or industry. The rapid evolution of digitalization in business activities and the increasing dependence on information technologies have contributed to making cyber threats widespread and increasingly sophisticated. These cyberattacks can lead to severe disruptions within the organization, result in the loss of sensitive data, damage its reputation, and generate significant financial costs, thus putting the company in a crisis situation. The consequences of a cyber crisis create significant imbalances that force organizations to operate unusually. These sudden and uncertain disruptions create significant stress and complicate decision-making, while remediation actions must be decided and implemented quickly to limit negative impacts. In such a context, effective crisis management requires careful preparation through the establishment of processes and tools. The goal is to promote a smooth response and to adopt automations that will allow for an effective long-term response while restoring trust within teams and the ecosystem directly or indirectly affected by the incident.

## [Common client-side vulnerabilities of web applications](https://excellium-services.com/2023/12/11/common-client-side-vulnerabilities-web-applications/)

You may be aware of the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/), which is commonly referring to the top 10 web application security risks list from the OWASP. But it’s lessen known that the OWASP published many of these top 10’s such as the one for the [APIs](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/) or the one for the [mobile applications](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/). In the same vein, they published a proposal for a “[Client-Side Security Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-client-side-security-risks/)” top 10 in 2022, focused on web application’s front-end, which can be compared to the mobile one as they both treat client-side security.

This list is not definitive and still under construction, but it is interesting as it highlights some of the most important things to consider for the front-end developers to avoid security mistakes.

In this newsletter, we will go through the 10 elements from the list to explain them and propose solutions to avoid the associated issues. As we will see, some of them are not that straightforward to understand, and some of them even need some interpretation.

## [The meaning of Domain Fronting](https://excellium-services.com/2023/11/27/what-is-the-meaning-domain-fronting/)

The purpose of this article is to talk about Domain Fronting . We will therefore focus on the “Host” header field.

## 1. The HTTP “Host” header, the art of Virtual Hosting

The Host request header specifies the host and port number of the server to which the request is being sent.

In our previous example (“Host: mydomain.xyz”), the host is “mydomain.xyz” and the port is either 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS). The port is usually implicitly enforced by the URL scheme (http:// or <https://>).

However, there is a difference between the host in the URL, and the Host header in the message request. In fact, the URL (<http://mydomain.xyz/>) tells your browser and computer to send the HTTP packets to the IP associated with mydomain.xyz, on port TCP/443……..

## Context and objective of the blog post

In the Intrusion and Application Security team (called **IAS** for the rest of the post), we discover and publish vulnerabilities found in commercial products almost [every year since 2015](https://excellium-services.com/cert-xlm-advisory/). This process is done with the Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) system.

With time, we faced different kinds of issues as well as misunderstandings in the publishing process. Therefore, we decided to create a blog post, in the form of a [FAQ](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/faq), to:

1. Provide a better understanding of the CVE system.
2. Play to [MythBusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters) with some CVE’s related myths.
3. Be transparent and precise about the way we handle a vulnerability that we identify in software (web, mobile, desktop…).

💡 The content of this post is based on our experience and on the [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure) process that we follow, with the previous help of the [Excellium Services’ CSIRT](https://excellium-services.com/services/cert-xlm/).

## [How can domain takeover impact your JavaScript application?](https://excellium-services.com/2023/10/16/how-can-domain-takeover-impact-your-javascript-application/)

## Keywords

* Domain takeover
* JavaScript

* Dependencies

## Abstract

Most JavaScript developers rely on NPM to import dependencies to their applications. These dependencies are sent by other developers. If an attacker is able to gain access to a package’s NPM account, they could potentially update the package by adding a backdoor in the source code. As a result, all the developers using the compromised package will be infected by the backdoor.

If an attacker wants to target an application, they can try to find the dependencies of that application. Then, by doing a domain takeover, they can control an email address associated with one of these dependencies and in turn, take control of the dependency and inject a backdoor.

### Author

## How can domain takeover impact your JavaScript application?

### How are JavaScript applications built?

No matter what framework is used and if it’s a back-end or a front-end application, a JavaScript application is composed like other applications of custom code but also of dependencies.

One of the first famous dependencies was jQuery. That library helped all the JavaScript developers to create better website as it proposes some UI and network helpers. In addition, that library allows to “bypass” some browser restriction or limitation. The developer just needs to call the jQuery function and behind that, depending on the browser, jQuery uses the right native JavaScript function.

At the time, the usage of JavaScript grew and it became mandatory to have a dependency manager to import and manage all the dependencies used by the application. This when  the packet manager, [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) became important.

Everyone can create an account with his email and push some code that could be imported from all other developers of the world. Nowadays, some libraries are widely used, like React, Axios, Express, Vue, Moment, Bootstrap and jQuery.

### How can we find the libraries used?

So, as most of the front-end applications are based on a JavaScript framework, it could be interesting to find which libraries are used by that application. On the developer side, the list of these dependencies is in the *package.json* file. That file is parsed by the tool NPM when the developer does a ‘npm install’ to import all the libraries that they need.

When the application is packaged before going in production, the code could be obfuscated and minified.. So, retrieving all the dependencies name could be painful.

In some cases, the packaging process creates a .map file associated with each .js file. In case of error, the browser can add a line into the console to inform that an error occurred on the line X, but with a minified code, the code can take only 1 line; therefore the debugging process could be complex. Map files allow the developer to have more details from the error and pointing to a real line on the code before the minification process. Except for debugging an error, the map file is not needed by the user visiting the website.

The interesting point is that the list of the dependencies of the application is also referenced in map files. This list could be extracted with a simple bash command using the [JQ tool](https://github.com/jqlang/jq), for example.

The example in the next figure is decomposed in two commands as the package name can differ if it starts with a ‘@’ or not.

![How can domain takeover impact your JavaScript application? - 001](https://excellium-services.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture1-1.png)

Now, a list of all the dependencies used by the front-end application is created … but only the main dependencies that the developer needed.

### Does a dependency have a dependency?

With the map file, we only collect the dependencies that the application needs but what about “nested dependencies”?

Any code can have dependencies, there can be multiple levels of dependencies included.

The NPM API allows getting the dependencies of a package, the list is given on the JSON data return like the following one.

![How can domain takeover impact your JavaScript application? - 002](https://excellium-services.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture2-1.png)

So, by getting the last version of a package and then the dependencies, it’s  possible to get the dependencies of the dependencies of the dependencies of the … you see the point.

So now, we really have a list of all the dependencies used by the application.

### How can we find the owner of a library?

When a dependency is pushed on the NPM website, the creator must have an email to login. The library’s developer is also known as the maintainer. Each library can have multiple maintainers which makes collaboration easier.

Same as the previous part, the NPM API allows anyone to retrieve the package maintainer email for all the version of the given package.

The first step is to get the latest version, and then get the maintainers’ emails address with a simple JQ command like shown by the first command in the figure below.

The second command shows how to list all the maintainers of all the previous version.

![How can domain takeover impact your JavaScript application? - 003](https://excellium-services.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture3.png)

At that point, we have a list of all the maintainers’ email address of all the libraries used by the application.

### Wait, what the link between this and ‘domain takeover’?

So, let’s go back to the “domain takeover” part:

A domain takeover is the fact to buy a domain name that was previously owned by another entity but then became available on the market. After buying the domain, it can be used to get access to resources that the previous owner of the domain has.

For example, if a package named **foobar** on NPM was developed by **Jean-Jacques** from the company **acme.lu**. That guy used his professional address to push the package, so **jjacques@acme.lu**.

However, the ACME company closed and the domain acme.lu became free to register after 1 year as no one renewed it.

Anyone can buy that domain on a [registrar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar) and create an email address jjacques@acme.lu.

With this email address created, it’s possible to use the “forgot password” feature of the NPM website and get a new access to the NPM account previously used to push the foobar package.

This method could be used with all the website on which one Jean-Jacques had an account and that could lead to a total hijacking of Jean-Jacques’s identity (mail, banks, shopping, social networks, …).

However, there is a limitation which is the 2 Factor Authentication (**2FA**). If the 2FA is enabled, it is not possible to take over the NPM account as we need at least a token or a recovery key.

Since May 2022, the top 500 package of NPM are forced to use the 2FA **but** **not the dependencies**…

### How can we check if the domain is still active?

As we identified our goal now, we should find all the email domains that are vulnerable to a domain takeover.

For that part multiple methods can be used, but one of them is to check if an [NS record](https://www.cloudns.net/wiki/article/34/) is present or not. If no NS is present, that implies that the domain is not referenced on the TLD root servers (.lu, .com, and so on), so a simple check can be made with a DNS request.

In the given example below, the domain possesses an NS server and some other check allowed to verify it’s not prone to domain takeover (we will not disclose a potential domain takeover on this blog post 😉).

![How can domain takeover impact your JavaScript application? - 004](https://excellium-services.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture4.png)

Sometimes, for intersting or high value domains,  an individual can buy the domain and wait for someone who needs it to notice. And if it is the case, that person can sell it more expensive than the original price. For example, one guy achieved to buy the google.com for 12$ and as Google really need it, an offer of 6000$ was made to get back this domain. That practice is now highly used and when a domain is bought for being sold more expensive it is called a “parked domain” or in a “parking state”.

So, if one of the domains found from the NPM maintainers emails **is parked**, it can **also** be **possible** to **acquire** it at a **more expensive** price than the original amount. The end results for this type of attack would be the same: own the domain and steal the NPM account to include a backdoor in the package.

Checking for parked domains was not implemented in the script, but some NS of parking companies can be found on the internet. If one NS matches the NS from the parking list, it can lead to a domain takeover.

### Are there some other takeover methods?

Another interesting method is to check if the email still exists. However, this not yield any successful during the research.

A large number of the emails found were gmail.com, almost 50%. While buying gmail.com domain could be possible previously, now Google should have a better handling of their domain expiration. We can assume it’s highly unlikely to be able to buy the gmail.com domain name.

Therefore, the first idea was to include if the script a check to see if the Gmail address exists by using the tool [GHunt](https://github.com/mxrch/GHunt). However it seems that it is not possible to recreate a Gmail email when it has been deleted (by the user or by Google). Google does not recycle account names, therefore, it’s impossible to recreate an email that doesn’t exist anymore.

Another possibility was to check for leaked credentials, if we are able to log in to the Gmail account, the goal is reached as we can reset the NPM password and push a backdoored version of the library.

These two methods are available for Gmail but also for all other email providers like Outlook, Yahoo, and so on.

### Conclusion

All that story to say: it’s difficult to find a domain takeover on NPM packages, but it’s also hard to check if libraries used by our software are prone to that vulnerability.

An offensive oriented script ([ExcelliumSA/MapOver](https://github.com/ExcelliumSA/MapOver)), was written during this research.  It could be adapted or totally changed to be included inside some security check made by a CI/CD for example.  The detection of a potential domain take over can be improved by adding some additional checks and could also be automated by sending some requests to a registrar.

## Intro

In today’s article, we will discuss the good and bad practices when facing a major incident.

Facing an incident is stressful for both : the victim and incident handlers. Therefore, to reduce the impact of that stress, we need to understand what are the good practices to adopt and what are the poor decisions one may make under the effect of the stress.

As for an example of an incident, we will run through a Human Operated Ransomware case scenario and see what could lead to a longer analysis time, communication difficulties, or at worst, your infrastructure being compromised again after the first attack.
