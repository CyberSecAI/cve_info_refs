    "Using weak default credentials for the Tomcat Manager (airleader/airleader)."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The advisory doesn't specify the exact impact but given the weak credentials and exposed manager interface an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the system.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Accessing the web interface with default credentials.",
     "Accessing the Tomcat Server Manager with default credentials."
