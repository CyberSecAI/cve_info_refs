Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references when parsing PLMXML files. The application's XML parser does not properly restrict the use of external DTDs, allowing a crafted XML document to specify a URI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611):** The core issue is that the application doesn't prevent the XML parser from accessing external entities specified in a malicious XML file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to force the XML parser to access a specified URI and embed its contents back into the XML document for further processing. This could lead to the disclosure of arbitrary files from the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML File:** An attacker crafts a malicious XML file that specifies an external entity reference (URI).
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to open the malicious XML file with the vulnerable application (JT2Go or Teamcenter Visualization) for the exploit to occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious XML file with a crafted URI for external entity reference.
- The attacker needs to get the user to open the malicious file using the vulnerable software. This could involve tricking the user into opening it or using social engineering tactics.
- The attacker can be local as this vulnerability is triggered by the user opening the crafted file with the vulnerable application, and the base score CVSS vector is "AV:L".

**Additional Details**
- This vulnerability is identified as ZDI-CAN-11890
- This vulnerability affects Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization before V13.1.0.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.6
- The vulnerability was reported to Siemens on 2020-09-25 and publicly disclosed on 2021-01-14
