A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

### 4.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Multiple Sectors
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** France

### 4.4 RESEARCHER

Sergey Temnikov and Andrey Muravitsky of Kaspersky Lab reported these vulnerabilities to ARC Informatique.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

**--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------**

ARC Informatique recommends upgrading PcVue to v12.0.17. Contact [PcVue Support](https://www.pcvuesolutions.com/index.php/support-request-en?view=form) to receive instructions on downloading and installing the latest software version.

Patches are available for Version 12 (12.0.17 Maintenance Release) and Version 11.2 (11.2.06097 Update).

The following mitigations and workarounds have been identified by ARC Informatique to help reduce risk:

* Uninstall the web and mobile backend. Users not using the affected components should uninstall them. If the components are not required, do not install them.
* Harden firewall configuration by ensuring that incoming connections on the corresponding port are authorized only if initiated by the IIS Web Server process. The listening port is configurable (default 8090) and may have been changed on the system using the Application Explorer.

**--------- End Update A Part 1 of 1 ---------**

For more information on this issue, please see Security Bulletin 2020-1 on the [ARC Informatique security page](https://www.pcvuesolutions.com/security/).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

## Description

A Denial of service vulnerability exists in PcVue 12, due to the ability for a non-authorized user to modify information used to validate messages sent by legitimate web clients.

CWE

[CWE-767: Access to Critical Private Variable via Public Method](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/767.html)

CVSS v3

0.0

([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H))

---

Exploitability

Remotely exploitable, network access to port 8090/TCP is required

## Attack complexity

Low

## User interaction

None

## Impact

Prevent legitimate users to connect and operate properly if using WebVue, the WebScheduler or the TouchVue mobile app.

Existence of exploit

PoC

Affected products

ARC Informatique PcVue 12.0.7 (including) through 12.0.23 (excluding)

Mitigation

Vendor mitigation

Update ARC Informatique PcVue software to [v12.0.23 or newer](https://www.pcvuesolutions.com/index.php/support-a-services/product-updates).

The Property Server is part of the Web & Mobile extensions of PcVue. If your system does not requires the use of the Web & Mobile features, you should make sure not to install them. In all cases, Web & Mobile extensions should only be installed on the PcVue Web back end server.

Kaspersky ICS CERT mitigation

* Set up the border firewall (or a similar network traffic control solution) to allow only authorized parties to send traffic to port 8090/TCP of the system.
* Use virtual private networks (VPN) to secure remote access to the industrial network. A VPN encrypts network traffic between VPN clients and the VPN server, as well as providing secure authorized access to local resources on the company’s internal network. Traffic encryption protects against traffic eavesdropping attacks, including man-in-the-middle (MITM) and other types of traffic analysis attacks.
* Compartmentalize your network: implement network segmentation and strict access control for each segment to provide more comprehensive and effective protection against a wide range of threats. Proper network segmentation prevents attackers from reaching critical assets in the event of a network breach.
* Implement a network intrusion detection system (NIDS). A comprehensive intrusion detection system is capable of detecting unusual network connections and abnormal traffic sent to the device, providing timely information about various suspicious activities and sufficiently reducing the attacker’s chances of successful exploitation.

| Summary: This article explains what must be done using the WAGO DALI Tool in order to modify properly addresses or mapping configuration. DALI stands for Digital Addressable Lighting Interface.  WAGO PLCs support DALI technology using a specific program and modules. The WAGO library DaliAdvFR\_32bits\_01 must be used. A single WAGO PLC can have up to 5 DALI modules each communicating with up to 64 ballasts. Each PLC is identified with an IP address and communicates with PcVue using the Xbus IP (Modbus TCP/IP) protocol. All the information required for PcVue is stored in the PLC’s internal memory. |
| --- |
| Details: When you make changes in the WAGO tool, you must change :  – The addresses of the ballast (which are stored in the ballast)  Modifications will only be taken into account if you do a backup by pressing the button ‘Store short address’ or ‘Sauv. adresses détectées’:  Wago_DALI_configuration_tool |
