Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26117:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the TigerVNC viewer mishandles TLS certificate exceptions. Instead of storing exceptions specific to a server and its certificate, the viewer was incorrectly storing the certificates as trusted authorities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Certificate Handling:** The core issue is the improper storage of server certificates as authorities when exceptions were added.
- **Trust on First Use (TOFU) Weakness:** While the viewer prompted users to accept a certificate for the first time, subsequent connections were not properly validated against the stored certificate and the server's hostname, leading to trust being based solely on the presence of the certificate in the exception list.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Server Impersonation:** A malicious actor who gains control of a certificate could impersonate *any* server to a client that had previously added an exception for a certificate.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Potential:** By compromising a certificate, an attacker could potentially intercept and manipulate data transmitted between the client and the real server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** An attacker would need to present a compromised certificate to the victim client.
- **Compromised Certificate:** The attack relies on the attacker having control of a certificate that the victim client has previously added as an exception.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Compromised Certificate:** The attacker needs to possess a TLS certificate that a victim client has previously accepted as an exception.
- **Network Position (potentially):** The attacker would need to be in a position to present the compromised certificate to the targeted client, which might involve a MitM scenario.
- **User Interaction (initially):** User interaction is required to initially accept the malicious certificate as an exception

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this issue involves storing exceptions based on a combination of hostname and certificate, mimicking the behavior of web browsers and SSH.
- The vulnerability affects both the native and Java TigerVNC viewers.
- The issue has been addressed in TigerVNC version 1.11.0 and later
- CVSS v3 scores for this vulnerability range from 8.1 to 9.3, depending on the source.
