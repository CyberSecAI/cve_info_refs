{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper path resolution in the `_resolvePath` function within the `fs.js` file of the `ftp-srv` library. Specifically, when Windows path separators (`\\`) are present, the `path.resolve` function does not correctly handle relative path traversal (`..`) components, allowing users to navigate beyond their designated root directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper path resolution",
      "Path traversal vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can escape the intended root directory of the FTP server, gaining access to unauthorized file system locations. This could lead to sensitive data exposure, modification, or deletion. The vulnerability is particularly impactful on Windows-based servers.",
    "attack_vectors": "Attackers exploit this vulnerability by sending specific FTP commands (e.g., `CWD`, `UPDR`) containing relative path traversal sequences (e.g., `..`) with Windows style separators (\\) in the path. By using `..\\..\\` they can traverse outside the specified root directory.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have an active FTP connection and be able to send FTP commands to the server."
