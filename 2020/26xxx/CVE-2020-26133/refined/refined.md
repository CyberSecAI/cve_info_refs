Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-26133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The default installation directory of Dual DHCP DNS Server (V7.40), `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\DualServer\`, has insecure folder permissions. The "Authenticated Users" group has write access to this directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure file system permissions: Authenticated users can modify the contents of the installation directory.
- Lack of integrity check: The service doesn't verify the integrity of its executable before running it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: A local attacker can replace the legitimate `DualServer.exe` binary with a malicious one. When the service is started (or restarted, such as after a reboot), the attacker's code is executed with SYSTEM privileges, effectively escalating their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs local access to the system where Dual DHCP DNS Server is installed.
- File Replacement: The attacker replaces the legitimate service executable with a malicious binary in the vulnerable directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the target system.
- Membership in the "Authenticated Users" group.
- Ability to write/modify files in the default installation directory.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor was notified of the issue but did not respond.
- A workaround is proposed to install the software in `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Program Files\` or `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Program Files(x86)\` as those folders restrict write access for "Authenticated Users".
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management).
