Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of user-supplied input within the ping functionality of the DAP-1360U's web interface. Specifically, the `host` parameter within the JSON data sent to `/index.cgi` is not properly sanitized before being used in a system command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection (CMDi). By injecting shell metacharacters (specifically a pipe `|` followed by a command) into the `host` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the device's underlying operating system (Busybox).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute any command that the web server user has privileges to execute, leading to the potential for complete system compromise.
- **File System Access:** Attackers can view, edit, and create files/folders on the web server's file system.
- **Wider Attack Surface:** This can lead to further attacks, including Privilege Escalation (PE), Advanced Persistent Threats (APT).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessed through the web interface of the DAP-1360U device.
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to `/index.cgi`, with a specifically crafted JSON payload in the `res_buf` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the web interface of the DAP-1360U.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the device's web interface.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter (`host` in the JSON payload) and how to inject commands using shell metacharacters like the pipe (`|`).

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable request is made to the `/index.cgi` endpoint.
- The vulnerable parameter is "host" within the JSON data in `res_buf`
- The attacker injects commands using the pipe character `|` followed by the desired command.
- Example of a vulnerable request:
  `/index.cgi?v2=y&proxy=y&rq=y&res_json=y&res_data_type=json&res_config_action=3&res_config_id=18&res_buf={"host":"192.168.0.52%7c%20ls%20-l%22,"count":1}&res_struct_size=0&res_pos=-1&tokenget=1268&&_=1593893639702`
  - The injected command is `ls -l` URL encoded as `%7c%20ls%20-l%22`
- Successful exploitation results in the output of the injected command included in the response from the device, alongside the ping output.

**Affected Versions:**

- D-Link DAP-1360U Hardware Revision A1 with firmware version 2.5.5 and below.

**Fixed Version:**

- D-Link DAP-1360U Hardware Revision A1 with firmware version 3.0.1
