    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"

    "attack_vector": "An attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/API/api/Asset` endpoint with a malicious SQL payload in the `originator` parameter.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided information includes a sample HTTP request demonstrating the SQL injection vulnerability. The response indicates that the injection caused an error due to a token mismatch, however, the DNS lookup confirms the successful execution of the malicious SQL payload. The vulnerable application is identified as Damstra Smart Asset version 2020.7."
