  "CVE-2020-26247": {
    "description": "An XXE vulnerability was found in Nokogiri, a Rubygem providing HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parsers with XPath and CSS selector support. XML Schemas parsed by Nokogiri::XML::Schema were trusted by default, allowing external resources to be accessed over the network, potentially enabling XXE or SSRF attacks. The new default behavior is to treat all input as untrusted. The upstream advisory provides further information how to mitigate the problem or restore the old behavior again.",
    "root_cause": "XML Schemas parsed by `Nokogiri::XML::Schema` were trusted by default, allowing external resources to be accessed over the network.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XXE (XML External Entity) injection",
      "SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers could potentially access external resources over the network, leading to XXE or SSRF attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a malicious XML schema to be parsed by `Nokogiri::XML::Schema`",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious XML schema that will be parsed by the vulnerable application."
