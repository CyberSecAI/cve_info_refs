Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26409:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization and resource management when processing Mermaid diagrams within Markdown fields. Specifically, the mitigation for previous DoS vulnerabilities related to Mermaid diagrams, which implemented a character limit, was bypassed by splitting a large malicious payload into multiple smaller Mermaid code blocks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The core vulnerability is the uncontrolled consumption of browser resources when rendering a large number of Mermaid diagrams. By splitting a large malicious payload into many small Mermaid code blocks, the character limit mitigation can be circumvented.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization:** The system lacks proper validation to detect and prevent excessive Mermaid diagram rendering requests.
*   **Bypass of Mitigation:** The character limit placed on Mermaid blocks is bypassed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability causes the browser tab rendering the page to freeze or crash, effectively causing a denial of service for users trying to access or interact with the affected page.
*   **Browser resource exhaustion**:  The browser tab consumes 100% CPU.
*   **Loss of user data**:  In some cases, the entire browser may freeze or crash, which can result in the loss of user data being edited.
*   **Inability to interact with the affected page:** Users are unable to view or interact with the attacked page.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Markdown Injection:** An attacker can inject multiple Mermaid code blocks into any Markdown field on the GitLab instance.
*   **Multiple Mermaid blocks:** The vulnerability requires multiple smaller blocks of Mermaid code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the GitLab instance to be able to modify content with Markdown.
*   **Ability to add Markdown:** The attacker needs the ability to post or edit any Markdown field (e.g. in issue comments, readme files).

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was reported via HackerOne report #990461
*   The issue affects all pages in GitLab where Markdown with Mermaid is rendered.
*   The attack can crash the entire browser in some environments.
