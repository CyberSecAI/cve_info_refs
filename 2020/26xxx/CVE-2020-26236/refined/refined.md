Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way ScratchVerifier generated and handled verification codes. Previously, if the `/verify/{username}` endpoint was called multiple times before the verification process was completed, the same verification code would be returned. This allowed an attacker to request the same code as a legitimate user, and if the attacker completed the login process using that code before the legitimate user, the attacker could gain control of the account.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Predictable Verification Codes:**  The system would return the same verification code upon multiple requests before completion, allowing for code hijacking.
- **Race Condition:** A race condition existed where the attacker could complete the verification process faster than the legitimate user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Account Hijacking:** An attacker could successfully log into another user's account on any service using ScratchVerifier for authentication.
- **Unauthorized Access:** This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user data and the ability to perform actions on behalf of the compromised account.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based Attack:** The attacker needs to interact with the `/verify/{username}` endpoint and the system performing the verification.
- **Timing-based Attack:** The attacker needs to complete the verification process before the legitimate user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to know the username of the target user.
-   The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the `/verify/{username}` endpoint.
-   The attacker needs to be able to submit the verification code faster than the legitimate user.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the `/verify/{username}` endpoint to generate a new verification code on each request, instead of returning the same code as previously. This prevents the attacker from hijacking the verification process, as the code used by the attacker will not be valid for the legitimate user's verification process, and vice versa.
