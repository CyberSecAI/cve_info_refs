  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input (specifically, server names and usernames/nicknames) when rendering the dashboard's HTML content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious code into the webserver front-end. This could allow the attacker to perform destructive actions or access sensitive information, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the affected server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector involves Discord users crafting server names and usernames/nicknames with malicious code.",
       "The injected code is then executed when the Red Discord Bot Dashboard webserver renders the user-controlled input."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be a user within a Discord server that is connected to a vulnerable Red Discord Bot and have the ability to set a crafted server name and username/nickname. This may also involve the ability to create or modify the name of a server or a user's nickname, depending on the specific Discord server's permissions."
