Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-26515:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in the flawed implementation of the "Remember Me" feature in codeBeamer ALM. The application attempts to encrypt user credentials (username and password) before storing them in a cookie (`CB_LOGIN`). However, due to a bug in the code, the encryption key is not properly generated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **NULL Encryption Key:** The encryption key, which should be derived from the server's MAC address, is always NULL due to an error in the key generation logic. Specifically, the MAC address is split using the wrong delimiter (`-` instead of `:`), resulting in a `NumberFormatException` and an empty byte array used for the key.
2.  **Empty Salt:** The salt used for encryption is also empty, which further weakens the security.
3.  **Predictable Encryption:** Because of the NULL key and empty salt, the encryption is essentially static and predictable across all installations of the software. This allows attackers to decrypt the `CB_LOGIN` cookie values if they have the decryption code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credentials Exposure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to decrypt the `CB_LOGIN` cookie and obtain the user's plaintext username and password.
- **Account Takeover:** With the plaintext credentials, attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation of project data, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Cookie Theft:** An attacker can intercept or steal a valid `CB_LOGIN` cookie from a user's browser.
2.  **Cookie Decryption:** The attacker uses the provided decryption code to decrypt the stolen cookie and obtain the user's credentials.
3.  **Account Access:** The attacker uses the decrypted credentials to log in to the user's account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Access to a Valid `CB_LOGIN` Cookie:** The attacker needs to obtain a `CB_LOGIN` cookie, which could be done by:
    *   Intercepting network traffic during login or subsequent requests.
    *   Stealing a cookie stored on the victim's machine via malware or other attacks
2.  **Knowledge of the Decryption Algorithm:** The attacker requires the decryption code or algorithm (provided in the advisory) to decrypt the cookie value. This code is publicly available.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `com.intland.codebeamer.utils.CookieUtils` class when generating the `CB_LOGIN` cookie.
*   The core flawed logic is within the `com.intland.codebeamer.security.SavedUserCredentials.getToken()`, `getCryptingKey()`, and `com.intland.codebeamer.manager.support.Crypter` classes and their related methods.
*   The vulnerability affects versions 10.0.0-final and 21.04-final, and potentially older versions, according to the advisory.
*   The advisory includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) Java code that can be used to decrypt `CB_LOGIN` cookie values.

**Mitigation:**

The advisory recommends that the "Remember Me" feature should be redesigned to use a randomly generated session ID instead of encrypted user information and the ID should be bound to the user agent and/or IP address of the user, and only be valid for a limited amount of time.
