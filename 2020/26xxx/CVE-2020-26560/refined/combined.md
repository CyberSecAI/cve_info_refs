## Devices supporting Bluetooth Core and Mesh Specifications are vulnerable to impersonation attacks and AuthValue disclosure

#### Vulnerability Note VU#799380

Original Release Date: 2021-05-24 | Last Revised: 2023-07-13

---

### Overview

Devices supporting the Bluetooth Core and Mesh Specifications are vulnerable to impersonation attacks and AuthValue disclosure that could allow an attacker to impersonate a legitimate device during pairing.

### Description

The Bluetooth [Core Specification](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/core-specification/) and [Mesh Profile Specification](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/mesh-profile-1-0-1/)  are two specifications used to define the technical and policy requirements for devices that want to operate over Bluetooth connections. Researchers at the Agence nationale de la sÃ©curitÃ© des systÃ¨mes d'information ([ANSSI](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/)) have identified a number of vulnerabilities in each specification that allow [impersonation attacks](https://francozappa.github.io/about-bias/publication/antonioli-20-bias/antonioli-20-bias.pdf) and AuthValue disclosures.

Devices supporting the Bluetooth Core Specification are affected by the following vulnerabilities:

#### Impersonation in the Passkey Entry Protocol

The Passkey Entry protocol used in Secure Simple Pairing (SSP), Secure Connections (SC), and LE Secure Connections (LESC) of the Bluetooth Core Specification is vulnerable to an impersonation attack that enables an active attacker to impersonate the initiating device without any previous knowledge (*CVE-2020-26558*). An attacker acting as a man-in-the-middle (MITM) in the Passkey authentication procedure could use a crafted series of responses to determine each bit of the randomly generated Passkey selected by the pairing initiator in each round of the pairing procedure, and once identified, the attacker can use these Passkey bits during the same pairing session to successfully complete the authenticated pairing procedure with the responder. Devices supporting BR/EDR Secure Simple Pairing in Bluetooth Core Specifications 2.1 through 5.2, BR/EDR Secure Connections Pairing in Bluetooth Core Specifications 4.1 through 5.2 and LE Secure Connections Pairing in Bluetooth Core Specifications 4.2 through 5.2 are affected by this vulnerability.

#### Impersonation in the Pin Pairing Protocol

The Bluetooth BR/EDR PIN Pairing procedure is vulnerable to an impersonation attack (*CVE-2020-26555*). An attacker could connect to a victim device by spoofing the Bluetooth Device Address (BD\_ADDR) of the device, reflect the the encrypted nonce, and complete BR/EDR pin-code pairing with them without knowledge of the pin code. A successful attack requires the attacking device to be within wireless range of a vulnerable device supporting BR/EDR Legacy Pairing that is Connectable and Bondable. Devices supporting the Bluetooth Core Specification versions 1.0B through 5.2 are affected by this vulnerability.

Devices supporting Bluetooth Mesh Profile Specification, versions 1.0 and 1.0.1, are affected by the following vulnerabilities:

#### Impersonation in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning

The Mesh Provisioning procedure could allow an attacker without knowledge of the AuthValue, spoofing a device being provisioned, to use crafted responses to appear to possess the AuthValue and to be issued a valid NetKey and potentially an AppKey (*CVE-2020-26560*). For this attack to be successful, an attacking device needs to be within wireless range of a Mesh Provisioner and either spoof the identity of a device being provisioned over the air or be directly provisioned onto a subnet controlled by the provisioner.

#### Predictable AuthValue in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning Leads to MITM

The Mesh Provisioning procedure could allow an attacker observing or taking part in the provisioning to brute force the AuthValue if it has a fixed value, or is selected predictably or with low entropy (*CVE-2020-26557*). Identifying the AuthValue generally requires a brute-force search against the provisioning random and provisioning confirmation produced by the Provisioner. This brute-force search, for a randomly selected AuthValue, must complete before the provisioning procedure times out, which can require significant resources. If the AuthValue is not selected randomly with each new provisioning attempt, then the brute-force search can occur offline and if successful, would permit an attacker to identify the AuthValue and authenticate to both the Provisioner and provisioned devices, permitting a MITM attack on a future provisioning attempts with the same AuthValue.

#### Malleable Commitment

The authentication protocol is vulnerable if the AuthValue can be identified during the provisioning procedure, even if the AuthValue is selected randomly (*CVE-2020-26556*). If an attacker can identify the AuthValue used before the provisioning procedure times out, it is possible to complete the provisioning operation and obtain a NetKey. Similar to CVE-2020-26557, identifying the AuthValue generally requires a brute-force search against the provisioning random and provisioning confirmation produced by the Provisioner. This brute-force search for a randomly selected AuthValue, which can require significant resources, must complete before the provisioning procedure times out.

#### AuthValue Leak

The Mesh Provisioning procedure could allow an attacker that was provisioned without access to the AuthValue to identify the AuthValue directly without brute-forcing its value (*CVE-2020-26559*). Even when a randomly generated AuthValue with a full 128-bits of entropy is used, an attacker acquiring the Provisionerâs public key, provisioning confirmation value, and provisioning random value, and providing its public key for use in the provisioning procedure, will be able to compute the AuthValue directly.

### Impact

#### Impersonation in the Passkey Entry Protocol

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to authenticate to the response victim device and act as a legitimate encrypted device. The attacker cannot pair with the initiating device using this method of attack, which prevents a fully transparent man-in-the-middle attack between the initiator and responder. For this attack to be successful, an attacking device needs to be within wireless range of two vulnerable Bluetooth devices that are initiating pairing or bonding for which a BR/EDR IO Capabilities exchange or LE IO Capability in the pairing request and response results in the selection of the Passkey pairing procedure.

#### Impersonation in the Pin Pairing Protocol

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to complete pairing with a known link key, encrypt communications with the vulnerable device, and access any profiles permitted by a paired or bonded remote device supporting Legacy Pairing.

#### Impersonation in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to successfully authenticate without the AuthValue. Once authenticated, the attacker could perform any operation permitted to a node provisioned on the subnet until it is either denied access or a new subnet is formed without the attacking node present.

#### Predictable AuthValue in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning Leads to MITM

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to successfully brute force the AuthValue and authenticate to both the Provisioner and provisioned devices, permitting a MITM attack on a future provisioning attempt with the same AuthValue.

#### Malleable Commitment

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain a NetKey, which could be used to decrypt and authenticate up to the network layer, allowing the relay of messages, but no application data decryption.

#### AuthValue Leak

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to compute the AuthValue and authenticate to the Provisioner and provisioned devices.

### Solution

Bluetooth users should ensure that they have installed the latest recommended updates from device and operating system manufacturers.

In addition to the two vulnerabilities affecting the Bluetooth Core Specification, the researchers also identified a potential security vulnerability related to LE Legacy Pairing authentication in Bluetooth Core Specification versions 4.0 through 5.2. The researchers claim that an attacker can reflect the confirmation and random numbers of a peer device in LE legacy pairing to successfully complete legacy authentication phase 2 without knowledge of the temporary key (TK). Because the attacker does not acquire a TK, or valid short-term key (STK) during this attack, completing authentication phase 2 is not sufficient for an encrypted link to be established. While the Bluetooth SIG does not consider this to be a method which can provide unauthorized access to a device, they still recommend that LE implementations requiring pairing and encryption use LE Secure Connections. The Bluetooth SIG also recommends that, where possible, implementations enable and enforce Secure Connections Only Mode, ensuring that LE legacy pairing cannot be used.

The Bluetooth SIG additionally makes the following [recommendations](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/key-attributes/bluetooth-security/reporting-security/) for each vulnerability:

#### Impersonation in the Passkey Entry Protocol

For the attack to succeed the pairing device needs to accept the same public key that it provided to the remote peer as the remote peerâs public key. The Bluetooth SIG recommends that potentially vulnerable implementations restrict the public keys accepted from a remote peer device to disallow a remote peer to present the same public key chosen by the local device, and the pairing procedure should be terminated with a failure status if this occurs.

#### Impersonation in the Pin Pairing Protocol

The Bluetooth SIG recommends that potentially vulnerable devices not initiate or accept connections from remote devices claiming the same BD\_ADDR as the local device. They also continue to recommend that devices use Secure Simple Pairing or BR/EDR Secure Connections to avoid known vulnerabilities with legacy BR/EDR pairing.

#### Impersonation in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning

The Bluetooth SIG recommends that potentially vulnerable mesh provisioners restrict the authentication procedure and not accept provisioning both random and confirmation numbers from a remote peer that are the same as those selected by the local device.

#### Predictable AuthValue in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning Leads to MITM

The Bluetooth SIG recommends that mesh implementations enforce a randomly selected AuthValue using all of the available bits, where permitted by the implementation. A large entropy helps ensure that a brute-force of the AuthValue, even a static AuthValue, cannot normally be completed in a reasonable time.

#### Malleable Commitment

The [statement from the Bluetooth SIG](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/key-attributes/bluetooth-security/malleable/) notes: "AuthValues selected using a cryptographically secure random or pseudorandom number generator and having the maximum permitted entropy (128-bits) will be most difficult to brute-force. AuthValues with reduced entropy or generated in a predictable manner will not grant the same level of protection against this vulnerability. Selecting a new AuthValue with each provisioning attempt can also make it more difficult to launch a brute-force attack by requiring the attacker to restart the search with each provisioning attempt."

#### AuthValue Leak

The Bluetooth SIG recommends that potentially vulnerable mesh provisioners use an out-of-band mechanism to exchange the public keys.

| **VU#799380.5** | Not Affected |

#### Vendor Statement

MikroTik Bluetooth implementation does not work in a peer-to-peer scenario, where pairing is involved. MikroTik devices work in Bluetooth Advertiser and Scanner topologies, where Bluetooth devices advertise/broadcast data over Bluetooth advertising channels, and MikroTik routers just scan the air to capture the Bluetooth payloads. Once again, there is no pairing involved. Pairing scenarios are scenarios where, for example, your phone connects to your headset, making a peer-to-peer connection between the two devices. In MikroTik's case, we do not support pairing, so it does not affect us.
MESH vulnerabilities also do not affect us, as MikroTik does not support this feature.

#### VU#199397: Insecure Implementation of Tunneling Protocols (GRE/IPIP/4in6/6in4)

January 15, 2025

The security researchers Mathy Vanhoef and Angelos Beitis have discovered [vulnerabilities in the tunneling protocols GRE, GUE, IPIP, 4in6 and 6in4](https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/usenix2025-tunnels.pdf). Among other things, attackers could gain access to a private network of an organization or execute Denial of Service attacks.

As this is a **vulnerability in the tunneling protocols themselves**, it **depends on the device configuration**, if the devices are affected by these vulnerabilities or not.

The operating systems **LCOS FX, LCOS LX, LCOS SX as well as the LANtools and the LMC** are **not affected** by these vulnerabilities, as they don’t support tunneling protocols.

The operating system **LCOS supports the tunneling protocols** **GRE, IPIP, 4in6 and 6in4**. However, the tunneling protocol **IPIP** is **only supported within an encrypted IPSec tunnel** and **therefore cannot be exploited**. With **default settings tunneling protocols are not active**, so that **routers with LCOS are not affected without corresponding configuration changes**.

#### Security vulnerability in Qualcomm chipsets - CVE-2024-43047

November 15, 2024

In a [Security Bulletin Qualcomm has published the security vulnerability CVE-2024-43047](https://docs.qualcomm.com/product/publicresources/securitybulletin/october-2024-bulletin.html), through which attackers can corrupt memory and potentially execute arbitrary code by means of a "Use-After-Free". In the [Security Bulletin](https://docs.qualcomm.com/product/publicresources/securitybulletin/october-2024-bulletin.html) Qualcomm also announces (under "Announcements"), that the vulnerability is already being actively exploited.

**LANCOM Hardware and Software products are not affected by this vulnerability.**

#### Security vulnerability in the webinterface of LCOS devices (Heap Overflow)

September 10, 2024

On 05.09.2024, the company SSD Secure Disclosure published [information regarding a security vulnerability in LCOS](https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-lancom-lcos-heap-overflow/), through which an attacker could trigger a “Heap Overflow” in the webinterface. This leads to an unexpected reboot of the device (DoS attack).

**Communication between LCOS devices and the LMC is not affected by this behavior**, as the LCOS devices initiate the communication.

LANCOM Systems has already fixed the security vulnerability and has made the error-corrected versions available to download in the download area. LANCOM Systems strongly recommends to update the firmware on your devices. The expected availability date of the error-corrected firmware versions in the Auto Updater will be the middle of Calendar Week 38.

* Current Firmware versions:
  + LCOS 10.80 SU8 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.com/downloads/))
  + LCOS 10.72 SU10 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.com/downloads/))
  + LCOS 10.50 SU15 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.com/downloads/))
* In addition, LANCOM Systems also provides the following EOL firmware versions:
  + LCOS 10.42 SU14 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.com/downloads/))
  + LCOS 10.34 SU6 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.com/downloads/))
  + LCOS 10.20 SU12 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.com/downloads/))
  + LCOS 10.12 SU17 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.com/downloads/))
  + LCOS 9.24 SU13 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.com/downloads/))

Until the error-corrected firmware has been uploaded to the router, the [web server services should be deactivated for the WAN interface (Section 3)](https://knowledgebase.lancom-systems.de/display/KBEN/Securing%2Bthe%2Bremote%2Baccess%2Bto%2BLANCOM%2Brouters%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2BWAN) and the [feature IPSec-over-HTTPS should be deactivated](https://knowledgebase.lancom-systems.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=37456657), too. Please note, that in doing so, VPN connections can only be established via IPSec and some Advanced VPN Client connections may not work anymore.

The web server services cannot be disabled in Public Spot scenarios without deactivating the Hotspot feature. For Public Spot scenarios, LANCOM Systems therefore recommends to immediately upload the error-corrected firmware to the device.

LANCOM Systems recommends to [prohibit access to the router from the WAN or limit access to VPN connections (Section 1) or at least restrict access to specific networks and/or IP addresses (Section 2)](https://knowledgebase.lancom-systems.de/display/KBEN/Securing%2Bthe%2Bremote%2Baccess%2Bto%2BLANCOM%2Brouters%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2BWAN).

#### Vulnerability in RADIUS Protocol (VU#456537)

July 9, 2024

Alan de Kok (founder and head of FreeRADIUS) has published information on a vulnerability in the RADIUS protocol ([VU#456537](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/456537))). This allows an attacker using RADIUS/UDP to convert an "Access-Reject" from the RADIUS server into an "Access-Accept" for the requesting device via a man-in-the-middle attack. This results in the requesting device gaining access to the network.

In general, the vulnerability on the RADIUS server must be rectified. For devices that function as RADIUS clients, the "message authenticator" forcing can optionally be activated.

**LANCOM R&S®Unified Firewalls with LCOS FX are not affected by this behavio**r, as they can only be used as RADIUS clients for IKEv2 in conjunction with EAP. EAP can be used. EAP requires the presence of the "Message Authenticator". **The LANCOM Advanced VPN Client is also not affected by this behaviour.**

**LANCOM routers and access points with LCOS, LANCOM access points with LCOS LX and LANCOM switches with LCOS SX are affected by this behavior.**
 The vulnerability has been fixed in the following firmware versions (RADIUS server) or can be mitigated via the "Require Message-Authenticator" function (RADIUS client):

**LCOS (RADIUS server and client):**

* 10.50 RU14 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.de/downloads/))
* 10.72 RU8 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.de/downloads/))
* 10.80 RU6 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.de/downloads/))

**LCOS LX (RADIUS client):**

* LCOS LX 6.20 Rel - release expected in August 2024

**LCOS SX (RADIUS client):**

* 3.34 SU8 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.de/downloads/))
* 4.00 SU13 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.de/downloads/))
* 4.20 SU3 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.de/downloads/))
* 4.30 Rel ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.de/downloads/))
* 5.20 SU9 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.de/downloads/))

Further recommendations for action regarding this security gap can be found in [this Knowledge Base article](https://knowledgebase.lancom-systems.de/x/xwAqCw).

#### Tunnelvision vulnerability (CVE-2024-3661)

May 24, 2024

On 06.05.2024, the Leviathan Security Group published information regarding the Tunnelvision vulnerability ([CVE-2024-3661](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3661)), which targets end devices with VPN clients. Through this, attackers can assign end devices a static route together with an IP address via the DHCP option 121. In doing so, data traffic bypasses the VPN tunnel and attackers can read the data traffic.

This vulnerability uses the **routing in the operating systems of the end devices as an attack vector**. Therefore, **LANCOM routers, access points,** **LANCOM R&S®Unified Firewalls as well as the LMC are not affected**.

The **Advanced VPN Client / LANCOM Trusted Access Client** is **affected by this vulnerability**. However, **attackers can only read the initial message of the VPN connection setup**. As the **company network cannot be reached via the routing entry assigned by the attackers**, **no communication with this network is possible**.

LANCOM Systems recommends the following countermeasures:

* In **public networks**, Split Tunneling should not be used and instead **all traffic should be routed via the VPN tunnel** (option **All through the tunnel** in the **Advanced VPN Client** in the used profile under **Split Tunneling** or **All network traffic (LANCOM Trusted Internet Access - Full Tunnel)** in the configuration of the**LANCOM Trusted Access Client**under **Security - LANCOM Trusted Access - Client configuration****).**
* On a**mobile phone,** **a** **hotspot can be established** and the **notebook can be connected to the hotspot****.** As the network is controlled by the mobile phone, attackers should not have access to this network. If the notebook features an integrated cellular modem, it can also be connected directly with the Internet.

#### SSID Confusion Attack – CVE-2023-52424

May 17, 2024

On 14.05.2024 the security researcher Mathy Vanhoef published information regarding a **vulnerability in the Wi-Fi standard** in his paper **SSID Confusion: Making Wi-Fi Clients connect to the Wrong Network**. It describes, how an attacker can direct a Wi-Fi client to another SSID on a „Rogue AP“ via a man-in-the-middle attack, if the same login credentials are used (this configuration is sometimes used in eduroam scenarios).

In his paper **Mathy Vanhoef reports**, that **some VPN clients deactivate the VPN connection in known/secure networks**. As a result **supposedly secure communication can be recorded by an attacker**. The **Advanced VPN Client / LANCOM Trusted Access Client also uses a mechanism to recognize known/secure networks**, however it **does not work based on wireless networks** (SSIDs). Therefore, **the behavior observed by Mathy Vanhoef cannot occur with the Advanced VPN Client / LANCOM Trusted Access Client**.

As this is a **vulnerability in the** **Wi-Fi standard**, it can also be exploited with LANCOM products **when using 802.1X and under certain conditions also WPA3**. **If the Wi-Fi standard is updated, LANCOM Systems will make adjustments in the firmware as quickly as possible.**

**LANCOM Systems therefore recommends** **using** **WPA2** or – if possible – using **Wi-Fi networks with different login credentials**.

#### Password of the administrator „root“ is reset after writing a full configuration with a further administrator

April 15, 2024

Through customer feedback we were able to fix a security flaw in LCOS, through which the password of the administrator “root” is reset – and therefore deleted - after writing a full configuration (e.g. an \*.lcf file) with a further administrator with supervisor rights.

**LCOS is affected as of version 10.80 RU1** by this security flaw. **Lower LCOS versions** as well as **other LANCOM operating systems are not affected**. **The behavior has been fixed in the LCOS version 10.80 SU4.**

**Unauthorized access to the router from the WAN (Internet) is not possible through this security vulnerability.**

**In Public Spot scenarios with a separate guest network with VLAN or a WLC-Tunnel management access from the guest network to the access points is not possible and therefore the risk is eliminated.**

 **Security vulnerability fixed in LCOS 10.80 SU4:**

**LANCOM Systems strongly recommends to install the error corrected LCOS version 10.80 SU4** ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.com/downloads/)).

* LCOS LX
  + The security vulnerability is fixed in LCOS LX 6.14 RU1 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.com/downloads/)).
* LCOS SX 4.20
* LCOS SX 5.20
* LANconfig
  + The security vulnerability is fixed in LANconfig 10.80 RU3 ([download](https://my.lancom-systems.com/downloads/)).

The following LANCOM operating systems are **not affected by the vulnerability**:

* LCOS SX 3.34
* LCOS SX 4.00

**LANCOM Systems will update the affected products with security patches shortly.**

**As an immediate measure, LANCOM Systems recommends using the encryption modes AES-GCM or AES-CTR** (without **Encrypt-then-MAC**) for SSH connections, as **these** **modes are not affected by the vulnerability** (with **LCOS SX 5.20** only possible **as of version 5.20 RU7**). You can find information regarding the configuration in [this Knowledge Base article](https://knowledgebase.lancom-systems.de/x/goCwCQ).

Due to the fact, that **“man-in-the-middle” skills** are needed to exploit the vulnerability (high attack complexity) and **also an encryption mode affected by the vulnerability** has to be used (see recommendation), the **threat level is not considered critical**.

#### Information regarding a security vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) (VU#347067)

October 5, 2023

The media has reported a security vulnerability in the error handling of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which allows potential attackers to disrupt network connections in the Internet by sending tampered BGP attributes (see the [blog entry of the security researcher](https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/bgp-path-attributes-grave-error-handling)).

After an in-depth review, we found that **the following LANCOM products are not affected by this vulnerability:**

* All LANCOM access points (LCOS and LCOS LX)
* All LANCOM switches (except LANCOM XS-6128QF)
* LANCOM R&S® Unified Firewalls with LCOS FX up to and including version 10.8 (no support for BGP yet)
  + LCOS FX as of version 10.11 RU3 (security vulnerability fixed in the firmware; it can be downloaded in the [Firewall license portal](https://my.lancom-systems.com/mylancom/lizenzportal/downloads/) as well as via the [Online updater](https://knowledgebase.lancom-systems.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=42106951))
  + LCOS FX as of version 10.12 RU3 (security vulnerability fixed in the firmware; it can be downloaded in the [Firewall license portal](https://my.lancom-systems.com/mylancom/lizenzportal/downloads/) as well as via the [Online updater](https://knowledgebase.lancom-systems.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=42106951))
* LANCOM Management Cloud
* LANtools (LANconfig & LANmonitor)
* LANCOM Advanced VPN Client

According to our analysis, the following products **are** **affected by the vulnerability**:

* LANCOM routers with LCOS up to and including version 10.80 REL (as of November 2023)
  + The behaviour is **fixed as of LCOS versions 10.72 RU6 and 10.80 RU1.**
* LANCOM XS-6128QF with LCOS SX 5.x
* LANCOM R&S® Unified Firewalls with LCOS FX as of version 10.9
  + up to and including LCOS FX 10.11 RU2 (branch LCOS FX 10.11)
  + up to and including LCOS FX 10.12 RU2 (branch LCOS FX 10.12)

**Typically, BGP is not used in the Internet on LANCOM routers and Unified Firewalls as well as the XS-6128QF, but in closed environments and private networks**. In addition, LANCOM routers and Unified Firewalls are designed as a VPN or security gateway and not as a router for an Internet node**. LANCOM Systems therefore classifies the security risk for the affected LANCOM devices as rather low**.

The security vulnerability in the affected products will be fixed with a patch as soon as possible. We will update this page accordingly.

#### Urgent recommendation for Unified Firewall customers

March 30, 2023

On 22.02.2023 we received news, that our OEM partner for **Content-Filtering and Anti-Spam services** for the Uniified Firewalls has gone bankrupt, so that the operation of both services can no longer be guaranteed without interruption.

**Since 29.03.2023 we have provided our customers with an update to LCOS FX version 10.11, in which [a new service has been implemented](https://www.lancom-systems.com/products/firmware/lcos-fx-release/faq-unified-threat-management). We therefore recommend that all customers switch to the new software version LCOS FX 10.11 immediately.**

**You can obtain the current firmware from the [firewall licence portal on our website](https://my.lancom-systems.com/mylancom/) and via the update functions in the web interface and the LMC.**

If you are **unable to update to LCOS FX 10.11**, please note the following information:

**Not affected: Antivirus and Anti-Malware, Application filter, IDS / IPS and all LANCOM UF Basic License features. The Content Filter in LCOS routers is also not affected by this issue.**

**Impact of a potential outage:**

Should a failure of the Content-Filtering and Anti-Spam services occur, this would have the following effects:

* The Firewall acts, as if both services were deactivated.
* Invoking websites is possible without any limitations.
* E-Mails are forwarded without Spam checking and filtering.

**Further measures:**

* Usage of the Content Filter in combination with the BPjM module. The BPjM filter uses an official list of websites of the german Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährende Medien (BPjM), whose contents are classified as harmful to minors. You can find a Knowledge Base article on how to configure the BPjM filter [here](https://knowledgebase.lancom-systems.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=130777115).

#### Information regarding the paper „Framing Frames“ from Mathy Vanhoef (CVE-2022-47522)

March 27, 2023

On 27.03.2023 the security specialist Mathy Vanhoef [published the paper „Framing Frames“](https://papers.mathyvanhoef.com/usenix2023-wifi.pdf), which details three different WiFi security flaws:

1. **"Overriding the Victims Security Context / MAC address stealing attacks"**

    LANCOM WiFi products with **LCOS and LCOS LX** are **affected** by this behavior. **LANCOM Systems classifies this security flaw as low**, as a **potential attacker would already have to be authenticated with the correct login credentials in the network**.

    **LANCOM Systems recommends to separate trusted and untrusted WiFi clients by using different SSIDs and networks** (see [example configuration in a WLAN-Controller scenario](https://knowledgebase.lancom-systems.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=36450881))**.** Furthermore in a scenario with a **single access point or WiFi router** the attackcan be prevented by **activating the feature** **“Protected Management Frames“** (see reference manuals [LCOS](https://www.lancom-systems.de/docs/LCOS/Refmanual/EN/#topics/wlan_pmf.html) and [LCOS LX](https://www.lancom-systems.de/docs/LCOS-LX/Refmanual/EN/#topics/feat_wlan_networks_encryption.html)).

    Regardless we are reviewing the implementation of additional security measures to prevent the execution of this attack in general.
2. **"Leaking frames from the Queue"**

    LANCOM WiFi products with **LCOS and LCOS LX** are **not affected** by this behavior.
3. **"Abusing the queue for Network Disruptions"**

    This security flaw is based on a **flaw within the 802.11 standard**. LANCOM WiFi products with **LCOS and LCOS LX** are therefore **affected** by this behavior.

    **LANCOM Systems is reviewing the implementation of additional security measures to prevent the execution of this attack in general.**

 We have gathered additional information regarding the individual security flaws in [this Knowledge Base article](https://knowledgebase.lancom-systems.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=132776273).

November 7, 2022

There are currently reports in the media about several vulnerabilities in OpenSSL 3.0, which have been fixed by the "OpenSSL Project" with the security patch 3.0.7 released on November 2, 2022.

**After thorough analysis, we can report that LANCOM operating systems (all LCOS versions) and devices as well as the Advanced VPN Client and the LANtools are not affected by the vulnerabilities.**

The LMC is currently still being evaluated. As soon as a result is available, it will be published in this release.

#### Security flaw in GS-2352(P)

September 16, 2022

LANCOM Systems takes customer feedback regarding quality and security of its products very seriously. Through customer feedback, a behavior on a LANCOM GS-2352(P) switch was identified. This only affects the GS-2352(P), but not the rest of the GS-23xx series switches or other switch series.

If a device connected to the switch ports 1 – 24 sends a packet to the switch, it is also mirrored to the ports 25 – 50. This only affects packets destined for the switch itself but not data traffic destined for other network devices.

Therefore, LANCOM Systems recommends to always use secure and encrypted communication protocols for operating and managing its products. On a GS-23xx series switch, several insecure protocols can be used with default settings. LANCOM Systems therefore strongly recommends to adjust the security settings on the switch, if not already implemented. The procedure is described in [this Knowledge Base article](https://knowledgebase.lancom-systems.de/display/KBEN/Securing%2Baccess%2Bto%2Ba%2BGS-23xx%2Bseries%2Bswitch%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2Blocal%2Bnetwork).

#### Informations on a vulnerability in the OpenSSL library (CVE-2022-0778)

April 14, 2022

The media have reported a vulnerability in the OpenSSL library that allows an attacker to perform a DoS attack on the target system using crafted TLS certificates (see [CVE-2022-0778](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-0778)).

LANCOM products are affected by this vulnerability due to the OpenSSL versions used. It is recommended to update to the following operating system versions:

* LCOS 10.50 as of version RU7
* LCOS 10.42 as of version RU7
* LCOS 10.34 SU5
* LCOS 10.32.0031 PR (BSI BSZ)
* LCOS FX 10.7 as of version RU2
* LCOS LX as of version 5.36 REL
* LCOS SX as of versions 3.34 REL & 4.00 RU7
* LCOS SX as of version 5.20 RU1

All operating system versions are available as a [download on our website](https://my.lancom-systems.com/downloads/).

The LANCOM Management Cloud (LMC) has already been provided with a security patch.

For private LMC instances, the host systems may be affected, not the LANCOM products themselves. In this case, we recommend securing the systems with appropriate patches.

## Bluetooth SIG Statement Regarding the ‘Impersonation Attack in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning’ Vulnerability

Researchers at the Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information (ANSSI) and researchers at Purdue University have independently identified a security vulnerability related to provisioning in the Bluetooth® Mesh Profile Specification versions 1.0 and 1.0.1. These groups of researchers both identified that it was possible for an attacker without knowledge of the AuthValue, spoofing a device being provisioned, to use crafted responses to appear to possess the AuthValue and be issued a valid NetKey and potentially an AppKey.

For this attack to be successful, an attacking device needs to be within wireless range of a Mesh Provisioner and either spoof the identity of a device being provisioned over the air or be directly provisioned onto a subnet controlled by the provisioner. After successfully authenticating without the AuthValue, the attacker can perform any operation permitted to a node provisioned on the subnet until it is either denied access or a new subnet is formed without the attacking node present.

The Bluetooth SIG is recommending that potentially vulnerable mesh provisioners restrict the authentication procedure and not accept provisioning random and provisioning confirmation numbers from a remote peer that are the same as those selected by the local device.

The Bluetooth SIG is also broadly communicating details on this vulnerability and its remedies to our member companies and is encouraging them to rapidly integrate any necessary patches.  As always, Bluetooth users should ensure they have installed the latest recommended updates from device and operating system manufacturers.

For more information, please refer to the statement from the [CERT Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/799380/).

## Bluetooth SIG Statement Regarding the ‘Impersonation in the Pin Pairing Protocol’ Vulnerability

Researchers at the Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information (ANSSI) have identified a security vulnerability related to BR/EDR pin-code pairing in Bluetooth® Core Specification versions 1.0B through 5.2. The researchers identified that it was possible for an attacker spoofing the Bluetooth Device Address (BD\_ADDR) of a device to complete BR/EDR pin-code pairing with that device without requiring knowledge of the pin code.

For this attack to be successful, an attacking device needs to be within wireless range of a vulnerable device supporting BR/EDR Legacy Pairing that is Connectable and Bondable. The attacker must be able to identify the BD\_ADDR of the vulnerable device before it can launch the attack, generally requiring the device to be discoverable. If successful, the attacker will be able to complete pairing with a known link key, encrypt communications with the vulnerable device, and access any profiles permitted by a paired or bonded remote device supporting Legacy Pairing.

The Bluetooth SIG is recommending that potentially vulnerable devices not initiate or accept connections from remote devices claiming the same BD\_ADDR as the local device.

The Bluetooth SIG continues to recommend that devices use Secure Simple Pairing or BR/EDR Secure Connections to avoid known vulnerabilities with legacy BR/EDR pairing.

The Bluetooth SIG is also broadly communicating details on this vulnerability and its remedies to our member companies and is encouraging them to rapidly integrate any necessary patches.  As always, Bluetooth users should ensure they have installed the latest recommended updates from device and operating system manufacturers.

For more information, please refer to the statement from the [CERT Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/799380/).
