{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the way SAP Hybris's medias module generates destination paths for uploaded files. Part of the path is based on user-provided data, while another part consists of static context data. Since only the user-controlled portion varies, it is possible to craft sequential download links (bruteforcing) to access previously uploaded files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor",
      "Insufficient input validation leading to predictable path generation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can sequentially generate download links, potentially accessing sensitive files, such as those in the 'impex' directory. This could lead to the disclosure of critical Hybris information, including credentials.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. An unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted requests over the network.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the Hybris server. No prior authentication is needed."
