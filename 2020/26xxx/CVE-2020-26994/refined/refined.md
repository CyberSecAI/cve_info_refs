- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PCX files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A heap-based buffer overflow can occur.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted PCX file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a malicious PCX file to the user who opens it with the affected application.
