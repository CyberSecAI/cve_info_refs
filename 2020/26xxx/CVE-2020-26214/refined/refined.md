Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26214:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2020-26214 in the security advisory on GitHub. The advisory describes an LDAP authentication bypass vulnerability related to empty passwords, which matches the description of CVE-2020-26214.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   *   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Alerta server improperly handling LDAP authentication requests with empty passwords. Specifically, it was allowing unauthenticated binds, which the LDAP protocol (RFC 4513) explicitly warns against.
   *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   The Alerta server did not explicitly reject LDAP bind requests with empty passwords, contrary to the recommended practice in RFC 4513.
        *   The server was not enforcing that the password field must be non-empty.
        *   The vulnerability could only be exploited when the LDAP server was configured to permit unauthenticated binds.
   *  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could bypass LDAP authentication by simply providing a valid username and an empty password. This allows unauthorized access to the application and any associated data or systems.
   *   **Attack Vectors:**
       *   The attack vector is through the Alerta server's authentication mechanism when LDAP is configured as the authorization provider.
       *   An attacker could send an HTTP POST request to the `/auth/login` endpoint with a username and an empty password.
   *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        *   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the Alerta server's login endpoint.
        *   They must be able to send HTTP requests to the Alerta server.
        *   They must know a valid username registered with the LDAP server.
        *   The LDAP server must be configured to allow unauthenticated binds.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The content provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including references to relevant sections in RFC 4513, which is helpful to understand the expected behaviour of LDAP authentication.
*   The fix implemented is a check for an empty password during the authentication process, returning an HTTP 401 error if the password is empty.
*   The provided HTTP request/response example demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability before the patch.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `2bfa317` and included in the pull request #1345.
*   The advisory lists the affected and patched versions of the `alerta-server` package.
*   The advisory also suggests a workaround to disable unauthenticated binds in the LDAP server.

**Summary**

The provided content describes a security vulnerability in the Alerta server which allows authentication bypass through an empty password when the server is configured to use LDAP. The root cause is a failure to validate that the password is not empty during the LDAP bind operation which allowed anonymous binds to be successful. The fix for this vulnerability involves the server now explicitly checking for empty passwords and rejecting authentication attempts by sending a 401 Unauthorized response if the password is empty.
