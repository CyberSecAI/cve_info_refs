Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-26988

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR files. Specifically, the issue results in a write operation before the start of an allocated data structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The application writes data outside the intended memory bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, potentially gaining control of the system.
- Application crash: Triggering the vulnerability may lead to an application crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PAR file: The attacker crafts a malicious PAR file that exploits the parsing vulnerability.
- User interaction is required: A user must open the malicious PAR file using the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PAR file to the victim.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the victim system before exploitation.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization products.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version V13.1.0 and later of affected products.
- The vulnerability is associated with ZDI-CAN-11891.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).
