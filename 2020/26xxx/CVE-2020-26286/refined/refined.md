Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26286:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the image upload functionality of HedgeDoc, specifically how it handles file uploads. The application did not properly validate file types or sanitize file names during the upload process, allowing for the upload of arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate File Type Validation:** The application failed to properly check the MIME type and file extension of uploaded files, relying on potentially manipulated information.
*   **Lack of File Name Sanitization:** The application did not sanitize or validate the file names, leading to the possibility of uploading files with malicious extensions or directory traversal attempts.
*   **Unrestricted Upload Endpoint:** The `/uploadimage` endpoint was accessible without authentication under certain configurations, which enabled unauthenticated attackers to perform arbitrary file uploads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload any file to the server's upload directory. This includes potentially dangerous file types like HTML, JS, or PHP files.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Conditional):** If the uploaded files are directly served by a webserver that interprets code (e.g., a LAMP stack), the attacker could achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. This depends on the server configuration.
*   **Malicious Content Delivery:** Uploaded files could be used to serve malicious content to other users or to deface the website by overwriting existing files

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends an HTTP POST request to the `/uploadimage` endpoint with a crafted file.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** In configurations that allow anonymous uploads, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the HedgeDoc instance to send the malicious upload request.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a basic HTTP POST request, which is not difficult.
*   **No authentication needed** if anonymous uploads are enabled.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in HedgeDoc version 1.7.1.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by T. Lambertz.
*   The fix includes improved file type validation and sanitization, as seen in the commit diffs provided.
*   The provided content includes the commit diffs showing the changes made to the `filesystem.js` and `index.js` files to address the vulnerability.
*   The commit message itself explicitly mentions "Fix arbitrary file upload".
*   The security advisory on GitHub mentions that uploaded files may still be served and users need to verify their upload file storage and restrict mime types and file names, in addition to upgrading HedgeDoc.
