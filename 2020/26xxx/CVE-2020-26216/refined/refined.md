Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-26216:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the improper handling of user-controlled input within the TYPO3 Fluid templating engine, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Specifically, the issues were:

1.  **Unescaped `additionalAttributes` in `TagBasedViewHelper`**: The `TagBasedViewHelper` did not properly escape keys within the `additionalAttributes` array. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious HTML into attribute names.
2.  **Unescaped Content Arguments**: ViewHelpers using the `CompileWithContentArgumentAndRenderStatic` trait, when `escapeOutput` was set to `false`, received the content argument in unescaped format, thus allowing potential XSS injection via content.
3.  **Unescaped `then` and `else` Arguments in `AbstractConditionViewHelper`**: Subclasses of `AbstractConditionViewHelper` would receive the `then` and `else` arguments without proper escaping, potentially allowing XSS if these arguments contained malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This is due to improper sanitization of user inputs when rendering Fluid templates.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The Fluid engine failed to properly escape user-controlled input before rendering it in HTML.
*   **Inconsistent Escaping**: There were inconsistencies in how content arguments were handled in different scenarios, depending on whether it was passed as a child node or as argument, leading to unexpected unescaped output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Injection:** An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML into the web page.
*   **Session Hijacking:** XSS could allow attackers to steal user cookies and hijack user sessions.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers could deface websites or redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers could use XSS to steal sensitive data displayed on the page.
*   **Full Compromise**: The XSS vulnerability could lead to a full compromise of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted `additionalAttributes`**: An attacker crafts a malicious array of attributes with HTML in the keys and uses them as `additionalAttributes` in `TagBasedViewHelpers`.
*   **Unescaped content arguments:** Attacker provides malicious content as an argument to a ViewHelper that uses the  `CompileWithContentArgumentAndRenderStatic` trait with `escapeOutput = false`.
*  **Unescaped `then` or `else` arguments**: Attackers use a condition ViewHelper with `then` or `else` arguments to inject HTML code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Template Access/Control**: An attacker needs control over the template or data that is rendered using the vulnerable Fluid engine. This could mean control over backend data that is rendered via Fluid templates.
*   **Knowledge of Fluid Templates**: The attacker must be familiar with how to craft the malicious input for a Fluid template to trigger the vulnerability, specifically manipulating `additionalAttributes`, view helper arguments, or `then`/`else` arguments of condition view helpers.
*   **User Interaction:** In some cases, user interaction might be necessary, as XSS often requires a user to visit a malicious URL or trigger a specific action.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `typo3fluid/fluid` package versions 2.0.0-2.0.7, 2.1.0-2.1.6, 2.2.0-2.2.3, 2.3.0-2.3.6, 2.4.0-2.4.3, 2.5.0-2.5.10, and 2.6.0-2.6.9.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in versions 2.0.8, 2.1.7, 2.2.4, 2.3.7, 2.4.4, 2.5.11, and 2.6.10 of `typo3fluid/fluid`.
*   The fix involves:
    *   Explicitly escaping keys found in the `additionalAttributes` array.
    *   Detecting "content arguments" in ViewHelpers with `CompileWithContentArgumentAndRenderStatic` and escaping based on the `escapeChildren` state.
    *   Explicitly defining `then` and `else` arguments in `AbstractConditionViewHelper` subclasses as escaped.
* The vulnerability can also be mitigated by intentionally disabling escaping with `f:format.raw()`.
