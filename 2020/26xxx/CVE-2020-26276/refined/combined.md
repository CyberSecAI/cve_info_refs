* Updated to remove a pending MDM device if it was deleted from current ABM.
* Updated to ensure details for a software installation run are available and accurate even after the corresponding installer has been edited or deleted.
  + **NOTE:** The database migration included with this update backfills installer data into installation details based on the currently uploaded installer. If you want to backfill data from activities (which will be more comprehensive and accurate than the migration default, but may take awhile as the entire activities table will be scanned), run this database query *after* running database migrations:

```
UPDATE host_software_installs i
JOIN activities a ON a.activity_type = 'installed_software'
	AND i.execution_id = a.details->>"$.install_uuid"
SET i.software_title_name = COALESCE(a.details->>"$.software_title", i.software_title_name),
	i.installer_filename = COALESCE(a.details->>"$.software_package", i.installer_filename),
	i.updated_at = i.updated_at
```

* Filtered out VPP apps on non-MDM enrolled devices.
* Explicitly set line heights on "add profile" messages so they are consistent cross-browser.
* Deprecated the worker-based job to release macOS devices automatically after the setup experience, replace it with the fleetd-specific "/status" endpoint that is polled by the Setup Experience dialog controlled by Fleet during the setup flow.

These improvements are also live on [fleetdm.com/tables](https://fleetdm.com/tables)
* Added a new display name for hosts in the Fleet UI. To determine the display name, Fleet uses the `computer_name` column in the [`system_info` table](https://fleetdm.com/tables/system_info). If `computer_name` isn't present, the `hostname` is used instead.
* Added functionality to consider device tokens as expired after one hour. This change is not compatible with older versions of Fleet Desktop. We recommend to manually update Orbit and Fleet Desktop to > v1.0.0 in addition to upgrading the server if:

  + You're managing your own TUF server.
  + You have auto-updates disabled (`fleetctl package [...] --disable-updates`)
  + You have channels pinned to an older version (`fleetctl package [...] --orbit-channel 1.0.0 --desktop-channel 1.1.0`).

* Fleet Premium: Added the ability to know how many hosts and which hosts, on a team, are failing a global policy.
* Added validation to the `config` and `teams` configuration files. Fleet can be managed with [configuration files (YAML syntax)](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/configuration-files) and the fleetctl command line tool.
* Added the ability to manage osquery flags remotely. This requires [Orbit, Fleet's agent manager](https://fleetdm.com/announcements/introducing-orbit-your-fleet-agent-manager). If at some point you revoked an old enroll secret, this feature won't work for hosts that were added to Fleet using this old enroll secret. To manage osquery flags on these hosts, we recommend deploying a new package. Check out the instructions [here on GitHub](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/7377).
* Added a `/api/v1/fleet/device/{token}/desktop` API route that returns only the number of failing policies for a specific host.

Warning: For users that download and sync Fleet's vulnerability feeds manually, there are [required adjustments](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/6628) or else vulnerability processing will stop working. Users with the default vulnerability processing settings can safely upgrade without adjustments.
* Fleet Premium: Improved the vulnerability automations by adding vulnerability scores (EPSS probability, CVSS scores, and CISA-known exploits) to the webhook payload. Read more about vulnerability automations on [fleetdm.com/docs](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/automations#vulnerability-automations).
* Renamed the `host_settings` section to `features` in the the [`config` YAML file](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/configuration-files#features). But `host_settings` is still supported for backwards compatibility.

* Improved performance for aggregating software inventory. Aggregate software inventory is displayed on the **Software page** in the Fleet UI.
* Added the ability to see the vendor for Windows programs in software inventory. Vendor data is available in the [`GET /software` API route](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/rest-api#software).
* Added a **Mobile device management (MDM) solutions** table to the **Home > macOS** page. This table allows users to see a list of all MDM solutions their hosts are enrolled to and drill down to see which hosts are enrolled to each solution. Note that MDM solutions data is updated as hosts send fresh osquery results to Fleet. This typically occurs in an hour or so of upgrading.
* Added a **Operating systems** table to the **Home > Windows** page. This table allows users to see a list of all Windows operating systems (ex. Windows 10 Pro 21H2) their hosts are running and drill down to see which hosts are running which version. Note that Windows operating system data is updated as hosts send fresh osquery results to Fleet. This typically occurs in an hour or so of upgrading.

## Fleet 4.13.0 (Apr 18, 2022)

### This is a security release.

* **Security**: Fixed several post-authentication authorization issues. Only Fleet Premium users that
  have team users are affected. Fleet Free users do not have access to the teams feature and are
  unaffected. See the following security advisory for details: <https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-pr2g-j78h-84cr>
* Improved performance of software inventory on Windows hosts.
* Added `basic​_auth.username` and `basic_auth.password` [Prometheus configuration options](https://fleetdm.com/docs/deploying/configuration#prometheus). The `GET /metrics` API route is now disabled if these configuration options are left unspecified.
* Fleet Premium: Add ability to specify a team specific "Destination URL" for policy automations.
  This allows the user to configure Fleet to send a webhook request to a unique location for
  policies that belong to a specific team. Documentation on what data is included the webhook
  request and when the webhook request is sent can be found here on [fleedm.com/docs](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/automations#vulnerability-automations)
* Added the ability to see the total number of hosts with a specific macOS version (ex. 12.3.1) on the
  **Home > macOS** page. This information is also available via the [`GET /os_versions` API route](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/rest-api#get-host-os-versions).
* Added the ability to sort live query results in the Fleet UI.
* Added a "Vulnerabilities" column to **Host details > Software** page. This allows the user see and search for specific vulnerabilities (CVEs) detected on a specific host.
* Updated vulnerability automations to fire anytime a vulnerability (CVE), that is detected on a
  host, was published to the
  National Vulnerability Database (NVD) in the last 30 days, is detected on a host. In previous
  versions of Fleet, vulnerability automations would fire anytime a CVE was published to NVD in the
  last 2 days.
* Updated the **Policies** page to ask the user to wait to see accurate passing and failing counts for new and recently edited policies.
* Improved API-only (integration) users by removing the requirement to reset these users' passwords
  before use. Documentation on how to use API-only users can be found here on [fleetdm.com/docs](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/fleetctl-cli#using-fleetctl-with-an-api-only-user).
* Improved the responsiveness of the Fleet UI by adding tablet screen width support for the **Software**,
  **Queries**, **Schedule**, **Policies**, **Host details**, **Settings > Teams**, and **Settings > Users** pages.
* Added Beta support for integrating with Jira to automatically create a Jira issue when a
  new vulnerability (CVE) is detected on a host in Fleet.
* Added Beta support for Fleet Desktop on Windows. Fleet Desktop allows the device user to see
  information about their device. To add Fleet Desktop to a Windows device, first add the
  `--fleet-desktop` flag to the `fleectl package` command to generate a Fleet-osquery installer that
  includes Fleet Desktop. Then, open this installer on the device.
* Fixed a bug in which downloading [Fleet's vulnerability database](https://github.com/fleetdm/nvd) failed if the destination directory specified
  was not in the `tmp/` directory.
* Fixed a bug in which the "Updated at" time was not being updated for the "Mobile device management
  (MDM) enrollment" and "Munki versions" information on the **Home > macOS** page.
* Fixed a bug in which Fleet would consider Docker network interfaces to be a host's primary IP address.

  information about their device. To add Fleet Desktop to a macOS device, first add the
  `--fleet-desktop` flag to the `fleectl package` command to generate a Fleet-osquery installer that
  includes Fleet Desktop. Then, open this installer on the device.
* Reduced the noise of osquery status logs by only running a host vital query, which populate the
  **Host details** page, when the query includes tables that are compatible with a specific host.
* Fixed a bug on the **Edit pack** page in which the "Select targets" element would display the hover effect for the wrong target.
* Fixed a bug on the **Software** page in which software items from deleted hosts were not removed.

  + db.r5.2xlarge
* Redis

  + Amazon ElastiCache
  + cache.m5.large with 2 replicas (no cluster mode)

#### What was changed to accomplish these improvements?

* Optimized the updating and fetching of host data to only send and receive the bare minimum data
  needed.
* Reduced the number of times host information is updated by caching more data.
* Updated cleanup jobs and deletion logic.

#### Future improvements

* At maximum DB utilization, we found that some hosts fail to respond to live queries. Future releases of Fleet will improve upon this.

## Fleet 4.8.0 (Dec 31, 2021)

* Added ability to configure Fleet to send a webhook request with all hosts that failed a
  policy. Documentation on what data is included the webhook
  request and when the webhook request is sent can be found here on [fleedm.com/docs](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/automations).
* Added ability to find a user's device in Fleet by filtering hosts by email associated with a Google Chrome
  profile. Requires the [macadmins osquery
  extension](https://github.com/macadmins/osquery-extension) which comes bundled in [Fleet's osquery
  installers](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/adding-hosts#osquery-installer).

  installers](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/adding-hosts#osquery-installer).
* Added ability to see a host's MDM and Munki information with the [`GET api/v1/fleet/hosts/{id}/macadmins` API
  route](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/rest-api#list-mdm-and-munki-information-if-available).
* Improved the handling of certificates in the `fleetctl package` command by adding a check for a
  valid PEM file.
* Updated [Prometheus Go client library](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang) which
  results in the following breaking changes to the [`GET /metrics` API
  route](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/monitoring-fleet#metrics):
  `http_request_duration_microseconds` is now `http_request_duration_seconds_bucket`,
  `http_request_duration_microseconds_sum` is now `http_request_duration_seconds_sum`,
  `http_request_duration_microseconds_count` is now `http_request_duration_seconds_count`,
  `http_request_size_bytes` is now `http_request_size_bytes_bucket`, and `http_response_size_bytes`
  is now `http_response_size_bytes_bucket`

* Added ability to see the original author of a query on the **Query** page.
* Improved the UI for the "Software" table and "Policies" table on the **Host details** page so that it's easier to pivot to see all hosts with a specific software installed or answering "No" to a specific policy.
* Fixed a bug in which modifying a specific target for a live query, in target selector UI, would deselect a different target.
* Fixed a bug in which the user was navigated to a non existent page, in the Fleet UI, after saving a pack.
* Fixed a bug in which long software names in the "Software" table caused the bundle identifier tooltip to be inaccessible.

## Fleet 4.5.1 (Nov 10, 2021)

  sometimes left out).

## Fleet 4.5.0 (Nov 1, 2021)

* Fleet Premium: Added a Team admin user role. This allows users to delegate the responsibility of managing team members in Fleet. Documentation for the permissions associated with the Team admin and other user roles can be found [here on fleetdm.com/docs](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/permissions).
* Added Apache Kafka logging plugin. Documentation for configuring Kafka as a logging plugin can be found [here on fleetdm.com/docs](https://fleetdm.com/docs/deploying/configuration#kafka-rest-proxy-logging). Thank you to Joseph Macaulay for adding this capability.
* Added support for [MinIO](https://min.io/) as a file carving backend. Documentation for configuring MinIO as a file carving backend can be found [here on fleetdm.com/docs](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/fleetctl-cli#minio). Thank you to Chandra Majumdar and Ben Edwards for adding this capability.
* Added support for generating a `.pkg` osquery installer on Linux without dependencies (beyond Docker) with the `fleetctl package` command.
* Improved the performance of vulnerability processing by making the process consume less RAM. Documentation for the vulnerability processing feature can be found [here on fleetdm.com/docs](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/vulnerability-processing).
* Added the ability to run a live query and receive results using only the Fleet REST API with a `GET /api/v1/fleet/queries/run` API route. Documentation for this new API route can be found [here on fleetdm.com/docs](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/rest-api#run-live-query).
* Added ability to see whether a specific host is "Passing" or "Failing" a policy on the **Host details** page. This information is also exposed in the `GET api/v1/fleet/hosts/{id}` API route. In Fleet, a policy is a "yes" or "no" question you can ask of all your hosts.
* Added the ability to quickly see the total number of "Failing" policies for a particular host on the **Hosts** page with a new "Issues" column. Total "Issues" are also revealed on a specific host's **Host details** page.
* Added the ability to see which platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux) a specific query is compatible with. The compatibility detected by Fleet is estimated based on the osquery tables used in the query.
* Added the ability to see whether your queries have a "Minimal," "Considerable," or "Excessive" performance impact on your hosts. Query performance information is only collected when a query runs as a scheduled query.

  + Running a "Minimal" query, very frequently, has little to no impact on your host's performance.
  + Running a "Considerable" query, frequently, can have a noticeable impact on your host's performance.
  + Running an "Excessive" query, even infrequently, can have a significant impact on your host’s performance.
* Added the ability to see a list of hosts that have a specific software version installed by selecting a software version on a specific host's **Host details** page. Software inventory is currently under a feature flag. To enable this feature flag, check out the [feature flag documentation](https://fleetdm.com/docs/deploying/configuration#feature-flags).

* Check out the [permissions documentation](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/2f42c281f98e39a72ab4a5125ecd26d303a16a6b/docs/1-Using-Fleet/9-Permissions.md) for a breakdown of the new user roles.

Teams adds the ability to separate hosts into exclusive groups. This way, users can easily act on consistent groups of hosts.

* Read more about the Teams feature in [the documentation here](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/2f42c281f98e39a72ab4a5125ecd26d303a16a6b/docs/1-Using-Fleet/10-Teams.md).

### New features breakdown

* Added the ability to define a user's access to features in Fleet by introducing the Admin, Maintainer, and Observer roles. Available in Fleet Core.
* Added the ability to separate hosts into exclusive groups with the Teams feature. The Teams feature is available for Fleet Basic customers. Check out the list below for the new functionality included with Teams:
* Teams: Added the ability to enroll hosts to one team using team specific enroll secrets.
* Teams: Added the ability to manually transfer hosts to a different team in the Fleet UI.
* Teams: Added the ability to apply unique agent options to each team. Note that "osquery options" have been renamed to "agent options."

* Added Redis cluster support. Available in Fleet Core.
* Fixed a bug that prevented the columns chosen for the "Hosts" table from persisting after logging out of Fleet.

### Upgrade plan

Fleet 4.0.0 is a major release and introduces several breaking changes and database migrations. The following sections call out changes to consider when upgrading to Fleet 4.0.0:

* The structure of Fleet's `.tar.gz` and `.zip` release archives have changed slightly. Deployments that use the binary artifacts may need to update scripts or tooling. The `fleetdm/fleet` Docker container maintains the same API.
* Use strictly `fleet` in Fleet's configuration, API routes, and environment variables. Users must update all usage of `kolide` in these items (deprecated since Fleet 3.8.0).
* Changeed your SAML SSO URI to use fleet instead of kolide . This is due to the changes to Fleet's API routes outlined in the section above.
* Changeed configuration option `server_tlsprofile` to `server_tls_compatibility`. This options previously had an inconsistent key name.
* Replaced the use of the `api/v1/fleet/spec/osquery/options` with `api/v1/fleet/config`. In Fleet 4.0.0, "osquery options" are now called "agent options." The new agent options are moved to the Fleet application config spec file and the `api/v1/fleet/config` API endpoint.
* Enrolled secrets no longer have "names" and are now either global or for a specific team. Hosts no longer store the “name” of the enroll secret that was used. Users that want to be able to segment hosts (for configuration, queries, etc.) based on the enrollment secret should use the Teams feature in Fleet Basic.
* JWT encoding is no longer used for session keys. Sessions now default to expiring in 4 hours of inactivity. `auth_jwt_key` and `auth_jwt_key_file` are no longer accepted as configuration.
* The `username` artifact has been removed in favor of the more recognizable `name` (Full name). As a result the `email` artifact is now used for uniqueness in Fleet. Upon upgrading to Fleet 4.0.0, existing users will have the `name` field populated with `username`. SAML users may need to update their username mapping to match user emails.
* As of Fleet 4.0.0, Fleet Device Management Inc. periodically collects anonymous information about your instance. Sending usage statistics is turned off by default for users upgrading from a previous version of Fleet. Read more about the exact information collected [here](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/2f42c281f98e39a72ab4a5125ecd26d303a16a6b/docs/1-Using-Fleet/11-Usage-statistics.md).

### Known issues

* Query packs cannot be targeted to teams.

## Fleet 3.13.0 (Jun 3, 2021)

* Improved performance of the `additional_queries` feature by moving `additional` query results into a separate table in the MySQL database. Please note that the `/api/v1/fleet/hosts` API endpoint now return only the requested `additional` columns. See documentation on the changes to the hosts API endpoint [here](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/06b2e564e657492bfbc647e07eb49fd4efca5a03/docs/1-Using-Fleet/3-REST-API.md#list-hosts).
* Fixed a bug in which running a live query in the Fleet UI would return no results and the query would seem "hung" on a small number of devices.
* Improved viewing live query errors in the Fleet UI by including the “Errors” table in the full screen view.
* Improved `fleetctl preview` experience by adding the `fleetctl preview reset` and `fleetctl preview stop` commands to reset and stop simulated hosts running in Docker.
* Added several improvements to the Fleet UI including additional contrast on checkboxes and dropdown pills.

## Fleet 3.12.0 (May 19, 2021)

* Added scheduled queries to the *Host details* page. Surface the "Name", "Description", "Frequency", and "Last run" information for each query in a pack that apply to a specific host.
* Improved the freshness of host vitals by adding the ability to "refetch" the data on the *Host details* page.
* Added ability to copy log fields into Google Cloud Pub/Sub attributes. This allows users to use these values for subscription filters.
* Added ability to duplicate live query results in Redis. When the `redis_duplicate_results` configuration option is set to `true`, all live query results will be copied to an additional Redis Pub/Sub channel named LQDuplicate.
* Added ability to controls the server-side HTTP keepalive property. Turning off keepalives has helped reduce outstanding TCP connections in some deployments.
* Fixed an issue on the *Packs* page in which Fleet would incorrectly handle the configured `server_url_prefix`.

## Fleet 3.11.0 (Apr 28, 2021)

* Improved Fleet performance by batch updating host seen time instead of updating synchronously. This improvement reduces MySQL CPU usage by ~33% with 4,000 simulated hosts and MySQL running in Docker.
* Added support for software inventory, introducing a list of installed software items on each host's respective *Host details* page. This feature is flagged off by default (for now). Check out [the feature flag documentation for instructions on how to turn this feature on](https://fleetdm.com/docs/deploying/configuration#software-inventory).
* Added Windows support for `fleetctl` agent autoupdates. The `fleetctl updates` command provides the ability to self-manage an agent update server. Available for Fleet Basic customers.
* Made running common queries more convenient by adding the ability to select a saved query directly from a host's respective *Host details* page.
* Fixed an issue on the *Query* page in which Fleet would override the CMD + L browser hotkey.
* Fixed an issue in which a host would display an unreasonable time in the "Last fetched" column.

## Fleet 3.10.1 (Apr 6, 2021)

* Fixed a frontend bug that prevented the "Pack" page and "Edit pack" page from rendering in the Fleet UI. This issue occurred when the `platform` key, in the requested pack's configuration, was set to any value other than `darwin`, `linux`, `windows`, or `all`.

## Fleet 3.10.0 (Mar 31, 2021)

* Added `fleetctl` agent auto-updates beta which introduces the ability to self-manage an agent update server. Available for Fleet Basic customers.
* Added option for Identity Provider-Initiated (IdP-initiated) Single Sign-On (SSO).
* Improved logging. All errors are logged regardless of log level, some non-errors are logged regardless of log level (agent enrollments, runs of live queries etc.), and all other non-errors are logged on debug level.
* Improved login resilience by adding rate-limiting to login and password reset attempts and preventing user enumeration.
* Added Fleet version and Go version in the My Account page of the Fleet UI.
* Improved `fleetctl preview` to ensure the latest version of Fleet is fired up on every run. In addition, the Fleet UI is now accessible without having to click through browser security warning messages.
* Added prefer storing IPv4 addresses for host details.

## Fleet 3.9.0 (Mar 9, 2021)

* Added configurable host identifier to help with duplicate host enrollment scenarios. By default, Fleet's behavior does not change (it uses the identifier configured in osquery's `--host_identifier` flag), but for users with overlapping host UUIDs changing `--osquery_host_identifier` to `instance` may be helpful.
* Made cool-down period for host enrollment configurable to control load on the database in scenarios in which hosts are using the same identifier. By default, the cooldown is off, reverting to the behavior of Fleet <=3.4.0. The cooldown can be enabled with `--osquery_enroll_cooldown`.
* Refreshed the Fleet UI with a new layout and horizontal navigation bar.
* Trimmed down the size of Fleet binaries.
* Improved handling of config\_refresh values from osquery clients.
* Fixed an issue with IP addresses and host additional info dropping.

## Fleet 3.8.0 (Feb 25, 2021)

* Added search, sort, and column selection in the hosts dashboard.
* Added AWS Lambda logging plugin.
* Improved messaging about number of hosts responding to live query.
* Updated host listing API endpoints to support search.
* Added fixes to the `fleetctl preview` experience.
* Fixed `denylist` parameter in scheduled queries.
* Fixed an issue with errors table rendering on live query page.
* Deprecated `KOLIDE_` environment variable prefixes in favor of `FLEET_` prefixes. Deprecated prefixes continue to work and the Fleet server will log warnings if the deprecated variable names are used.
* Deprecated `/api/v1/kolide` routes in favor of `/api/v1/fleet`. Deprecated routes continue to work and the Fleet server will log warnings if the deprecated routes are used.
* Added Javascript source maps for development.

## Fleet 3.7.1 (Feb 3, 2021)

* Changed the default `--server_tls_compatibility` to `intermediate`. The new settings caused TLS connectivity issues for users in some environments. This new default is a more appropriate balance of security and compatibility, as recommended by Mozilla.

## Fleet 3.7.0 (Feb 3, 2021)

### This is a security release.

* **Security**: Fixed a vulnerability in which a malicious actor with a valid node key can send a badly formatted request that causes the Fleet server to exit, resulting in denial of service. See <https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-xwh8-9p3f-3x45> and the linked content within that advisory.

* Fixed a bug that allowed hosts to enroll with an empty enroll secret in new installations before setup was completed.
* Fixed a bug that made the query editor render strangely in Safari.

## Fleet 3.5.1 (Dec 14, 2020)

### This is a security release.

* **Security**: Introduced XML validation library to mitigate Go stdlib XML parsing vulnerability effecting SSO login. See <https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-w3wf-cfx3-6gcx> and the linked content within that advisory.

Follow up: Rotated `--auth_jwt_key` to invalidate existing sessions. Audit for suspicious activity in the Fleet server.

* **Security**: Prevents new queries from using the SQLite `ATTACH` command. This is a mitigation for the osquery vulnerability <https://github.com/osquery/osquery/security/advisories/GHSA-4g56-2482-x7q8>.

Follow up: Audit existing saved queries and logs of live query executions for possible malicious use of `ATTACH`. Upgrade osquery to 4.6.0 to prevent `ATTACH` queries from executing.

* Added warning in query UI when Redis is not functioning.
* Fixed minor bugs in frontend handling of scheduled queries.
* Minor styling changes to frontend.

## Kolide Fleet 2.2.0 (Jul 16, 2019)

* Added GCP PubSub logging plugin. Thanks to Michael Samuel for adding this capability.
* Improved escaping for target search in live query interface. It is now easier to target hosts with + and \* characters in the name.
* Server and browser performance improved to reduced loading of hosts in frontend. Host status will only update on page load when over 100 hosts are present.
* Utilized details sent by osquery in enrollment request to more quickly display details of new hosts. Also fixes a bug in which hosts could not complete enrollment if certain platform-dependent options were used.
* Fixed a bug in which the default query runs after targets are edited.

## Kolide Fleet 2.1.2 (May 30, 2019)

* Prevented sending of SMTP credentials over insecure connection

  + It is possible to schedule the same query with different options in one pack, but only via the CLI.
  + If you thought you were relying on this functionality via the UI, note that duplicate queries will be deleted when you run migrations as apart of a cleanup fix. Please check your configurations and make sure to create any double-scheduled queries via the CLI moving forward.
* Fixed a bug in which packs created in UI could not be loaded by fleetctl.
* Fixed a bug where deleting a query would not delete it from the packs that the query was scheduled in.

## Kolide Fleet 2.0.0 (currently preparing for release)

The primary new addition in Fleet 2 is the new `fleetctl` CLI and file-format, which dramatically increases the flexibility and control that administrators have over their osquery deployment. The CLI and the file format are documented [in the Fleet documentation](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/fleetctl-cli).

### New Features

* New `fleetctl` CLI for managing your entire osquery workflow via CLI, API, and source controlled files!

  + You can use `fleetctl` to manage osquery packs, queries, labels, and configuration.
* In addition to the CLI, Fleet 2.0.0 introduces a new file format for articulating labels, queries, packs, options, etc. This format is designed for composability, enabling more effective sharing and re-use of intelligence.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: query
spec:
  name: pending_updates
  query: >
    select value
    from plist
    where
      path = "/Library/Preferences/ManagedInstalls.plist" and
      key = "PendingUpdateCount" and
      value > "0";
```

* Run live osquery queries against arbitrary subsets of your infrastructure via the `fleetctl query` command.
* Use `fleetctl setup`, `fleetctl login`, and `fleetctl logout` to manage the authentication life-cycle via the CLI.
* Use `fleetctl get`, `fleetctl apply`, and `fleetctl delete` to manage the state of your Fleet data.
* Manage any osquery option you want and set platform-specific overrides with the `fleetctl` CLI and file format.

### Upgrade Plan

* Managing osquery options via the UI has been removed in favor of the more flexible solution provided by the CLI. If you have customized your osquery options with Fleet, there is [a database migration](/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/server/datastore/mysql/migrations/data/20171212182458_MigrateOsqueryOptions.go) which will port your existing data into the new format when you run `fleet prepare db`. To download your osquery options after migrating your database, run `fleetctl get options > options.yaml`. Further modifications to your options should occur in this file and it should be applied with `fleetctl apply -f ./options.yaml`.

## Kolide Fleet 1.0.8 (May 3, 2018)

* Osquery 3.0+ compatibility!
* Included RFC822 From header in emails (for email authentication)

## Kolide Fleet 1.0.7 (Mar 30, 2018)

* Now supports FileAccesses in FIM configuration.
* Now populates network interfaces on windows hosts in host view.
* Added flags for configuring MySQL connection pooling limits.
* Fixed bug in which shard and removed keys are dropped in query packs returned to osquery clients.
* Fixed handling of status logs with unexpected fields.

## Kolide Fleet 1.0.6 (Dec 4, 2017)

* Added remote IP in the logs for all osqueryd/launcher requests. (#1653)
* Fixed bugs that caused logs to sometimes be omitted from the logwriter. (#1636, #1617)
* Fixed a bug where request bodies were not being explicitly closed. (#1613)
* Fixed a bug where SAML client would create too many HTTP connections. (#1587)
* Fixed bug in which default query was run instead of entered query. (#1611)
* Added pagination to the Host browser pages for increased performance. (#1594)
* Fixed bug rendering hosts when clock speed cannot be parsed. (#1604)

## Kolide Fleet 1.0.5 (Oct 17, 2017)

* Renamed the binary from kolide to fleet.
* Added support for Kolide Launcher managed osquery nodes.
* Removed license requirements.
* Updated documentation link in the sidebar to point to public GitHub documentation.
* Added FIM support.
* Title on query page correctly reflects new or edit mode.
* Fixed issue on new query page where last query would be submitted instead of current.
* Fixed issue where user menu did not work on Firefox browser.
* Fixed issue cause SSO to fail for ADFS.
* Fixed issue validating signatures in nested SAML assertions..

## Kolide 1.0.4 (Jun 1, 2017)

* Added feature that allows users to import existing Osquery configuration files using the [configimporter](https://github.com/kolide/configimporter) utility.
* Added support for Osquery decorators.
* Added SAML single sign on support.
* Improved online status detection.

  The Kolide server now tracks the `distributed_interval` and `config_tls_refresh` values for each individual host (these can be different if they are set via flagfile and not through Kolide), to ensure that online status is represented as accurately as possible.
* Kolide server now requires `--auth_jwt_key` to be specified at startup.

  If no JWT key is provided by the user, the server will print a new suggested random JWT key for use.
* Fixed bug in which deleted packs were still displayed on the query sidebar.
* Fixed rounding error when showing % of online hosts.
* Removed --app\_token\_key flag.
* Fixed issue where heavily loaded database caused host authentication failures.
* Fixed issue where osquery sends empty strings for integer values in log results.

## Kolide 1.0.3 (April 3, 2017)

* Log rotation is no longer the default setting for Osquery status and results logs. To enable log rotation use the `--osquery_enable_log_rotation` flag.
* Added a debug endpoint for collecting performance statistics and profiles.

  When `kolide serve --debug` is used, additional handlers will be started to provide access to profiling tools. These endpoints are authenticated with a randomly generated token that is printed to the Kolide logs at startup. These profiling tools are not intended for general use, but they may be useful when providing performance-related bug reports to the Kolide developers.
* Added a workaround for CentOS6 detection.

  Osquery 2.3.2 incorrectly reports an empty value for `platform` on CentOS6 hosts. We added a workaround to properly detect platform in Kolide, and also [submitted a fix](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/pull/3071) to upstream osquery.
* Ensured hosts enroll in labels immediately even when `distributed_interval` is set to a long interval.
* Optimizations reduce the CPU and DB usage of the manage hosts page.
* Managed packs page now loads much quicker when a large number of hosts are enrolled.
* Fixed bug with the "Reset Options" button.
* Fixed 500 error resulting from saving unchanged options.
* Improved validation for SMTP settings.
* Added command line support for `modern`, `intermediate`, and `old` TLS configuration
  profiles. The profile is set using the following command line argument.

```
--server_tls_compatibility=modern

```

See <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS> for more information on the different profile options.

* The Options Configuration item in the sidebar is now only available to admin users.

  Previously this item was visible to non-admin users and if selected, a blank options page would be displayed since server side authorization constraints prevent regular users from viewing or changing options.
* Improved validation for the Kolide server URL supplied in setup and configuration.
* Fixed an issue importing osquery configurations with numeric values represented as strings in JSON.

## Kolide 1.0.2 (March 14, 2017)

* Fixed an issue adding additional targets when querying a host
* Shows loading spinner while newly added Host Details are saved
* Shows a generic computer icon when when referring to hosts with an unknown platform instead of the text "All"
* Kolide will now warn on startup if there are database migrations not yet completed.
* Kolide will prompt for confirmation before running database migrations.

  To disable this, use `kolide prepare db --no-prompt`.
* Kolide now supports emoji, so you can 🔥 to your heart's content.
* When setting the platform for a scheduled query, selecting "All" now clears individually selected platforms.
* Updated Host details cards UI
* Lowered HTTP timeout settings.

  In an effort to provide a more resilient web server, timeouts are more strictly enforced by the Kolide HTTP server (regardless of whether or not you're using the built-in TLS termination).
* Hardened TLS server settings.

  For customers using Kolide's built-in TLS server (if the `server.tls` configuration is `true`), the server was hardened to only accept modern cipher suites as recommended by [Mozilla](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Modern_compatibility).
* Improve the mechanism used to calculate whether or not hosts are online.

  Previously, hosts were categorized as "online" if they had been seen within the past 30 minutes. To make the "online" status more representative of reality, hosts are marked "online" if the Kolide server has heard from them within two times the lowest polling interval as described by the Kolide-managed osquery configuration. For example, if you've configured osqueryd to check-in with Kolide every 10 seconds, only hosts that Kolide has heard from within the last 20 seconds will be marked "online".
* Updated Host details cards UI
* Added support for rotating the osquery status and result log files by sending a SIGHUP signal to the kolide process.
* Fixed Distributed Query compatibility with load balancers and Safari.

  Customers running Kolide behind a web balancer lacking support for websockets were unable to use the distributed query feature. Also, in certain circumstances, Safari users with a self-signed cert for Kolide would receive an error. This release add a fallback mechanism from websockets using SockJS for improved compatibility.
* Fixed issue with Distributed Query Pack results full screen feature that broke the browser scrolling abilities.
* Fixed bug in which host counts in the sidebar did not match up with displayed hosts.

## Kolide 1.0.1 (February 27, 2017)

* Fixed an issue that prevented users from replacing deleted labels with a new label of the same name.
* Improved the reliability of IP and MAC address data in the host cards and table.
* Added full screen support for distributed query results.
* Enabled users to double click on queries and packs in a table to see their details.
* Reprompted for a password when a user attempts to change their email address.
* Automatically decorates the status and result logs with the host's UUID and hostname.
* Fixed an issue where Kolide users on Safari were unable to delete queries or packs.
* Improved platform detection accuracy.

  Previously Kolide was determining platform based on the OS of the system osquery was built on instead of the OS it was running on. Please note: Offline hosts may continue to report an erroneous platform until they check-in with Kolide.
* Fixed bugs where query links in the pack sidebar pointed to the wrong queries.
* Improved MySQL compatibility with stricter configurations.
* Allows users to edit the name and description of host labels.
* Added basic table autocompletion when typing in the query composer.
* Now support MySQL client certificate authentication. More details can be found in the [Configuring the Fleet binary docs](/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/docs/infrastructure/configuring-the-fleet-binary.md).
* Improved security for user-initiated email address changes.

  This improvement ensures that only users who own an email address and are logged in as the user who initiated the change can confirm the new email.

  Previously it was possible for Administrators to also confirm these changes by clicking the confirmation link.
* Fixed an issue where the setup form rejects passwords with certain characters.

  This change resolves an issue where certain special characters like "." where rejected by the client-side JS that controls the setup form.
* Now automatically logs in the user once initial setup is completed.

# Coordinated disclosure of XML round-trip vulnerabilities in Go’s standard library

[Juho Forsén](https://mattermost.com/blog/author/juho-forsen/ "Posts by Juho Forsén")

December 14, 2020

[Engineering](https://mattermost.com/blog/category/engineering/)

This blog post is a part of Mattermost’s public disclosure of three serious vulnerabilities in Go’s `encoding/xml` related to tokenization round-trips. The public disclosure comes as a result of several months of work, including collaborating with the Go security team since August 2020 and with affected downstream project maintainers since earlier this month. There are several potential security problems created by these vulnerabilities, one of which is a complete bypass of SAML authentication.

**These issues do not impact Mattermost customers.** See [“No impact to Mattermost customers”](#no-impact-to-mattermost-customers) below for more info.

Despite significant efforts by the Go security team, it has not been possible to patch the vulnerabilities discussed in this blog post. Only one of the three is on the roadmap to be patched in the foreseeable future (see [“Update 12/13/2020” below](#update)). The mitigation for the remaining issues will be adding a new mode in Go to make explicit that these vulnerabilities exist. Downstream projects that assume certain integrity guarantees from Go’s standard library are vulnerable when those guarantees do not hold. The implications of these vulnerabilities in key use cases we have identified present a material security concern. If you maintain a Go-based project that relies on XML integrity, we urge you to read this post carefully.

We don’t take this type of public disclosure lightly, and it has not been an easy decision to make. There are three reasons why we are doing this now:

* The Go security team has determined that the root causes of the vulnerabilities cannot be reliably addressed.
* Go is introducing publicly-visible API changes related to these issues in an upcoming major release, which risks making the vulnerabilities public without explicit public disclosure.
  + The Go security team has agreed to Mattermost coordinating disclosure prior to making their changes public in order to minimize impact to parts of the ecosystem that can’t benefit from the new API. Refer to the [“Upcoming changes in Go”](#upcoming-changes-in-go) section for details.
* Careful steps have been taken to privately disclose the issues to as many affected parties as possible prior to proceeding with public disclosure. All parties involved in the disclosure have collaborated to ensure mitigations are in place and sufficient.

## The vulnerabilities

As part of our security work, we have identified three independently exploitable vulnerabilities in Go’s `encoding/xml`. The advisories are linked below:

* [CVE-2020-29509: XML attribute instability in Go’s encoding/xml](https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator/blob/master/advisories/unstable-attributes.md)
* [CVE-2020-29510: XML directive instability in Go’s encoding/xml](https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator/blob/master/advisories/unstable-directives.md)
* [CVE-2020-29511: XML element instability in Go’s encoding/xml](https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator/blob/master/advisories/unstable-elements.md)

As evident from the titles, the vulnerabilities are closely related. The core issue is the same in all three: maliciously crafted XML markup mutates during round-trips through Go’s decoder and encoder implementations.

What does that mean in practice? If your application processes XML and, while processing it, parses markup that’s the output of at least one preceding round of parsing and serialization, you can no longer assume the output of that parsing matches the output from the preceding round. In other words, passing XML through Go’s decoder and encoder doesn’t preserve its semantics.

This may sound like a non-issue or a source of functional bugs at worst, but the reality of it is much more serious. There are applications that absolutely require semantic integrity in XML in order to be secure — a major example being SAML.

SAML, or the Security Assertion Markup Language, is an XML-based standard approach to single sign-on on the web. It conveys user identity in XML documents whose integrity and authenticity are guaranteed using cryptographic signatures, a scheme called XML-DSig. Because of these vulnerabilities, Go-based SAML implementations are in many cases open to tampering by an attacker: by injecting malicious markup to a correctly signed SAML message, it’s possible to make it still appear correctly signed, but change its semantics to convey a different identity than the original document.

The actual impact of these XML round-trip vulnerabilities of course varies by use case, but in SAML SSO it’s easy to understand: if your SAML messages can be altered to say you’re someone you’re not, the result is arbitrary privilege escalation within the scope of the SAML Service Provider, or in some cases even complete authentication bypass.

As mentioned before, despite significant efforts by the Go security team, there is no Go patch that would reasonably address these vulnerabilities. That doesn’t mean all hope is lost: Along with the public disclosure of these vulnerabilities, we’re open-sourcing an XML validation library that can be used as a workaround. The library as well as basic instructions for its use can be found at [github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator](https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator).

## No impact to Mattermost customers

At the time this public disclosure is taking place, no supported versions of Mattermost products are affected by any of the vulnerabilities. Any impact to Mattermost software has been addressed independently prior to this disclosure and communicated to customers according to Mattermost’s standard disclosure policy. **No action is required from Mattermost customers at this time.**

Mattermost staff originally detected the first one of these vulnerabilities during an internal security review on the 28th of August, 2020. As an immediate response the only affected feature of Mattermost server, a new SAML implementation still in beta at the time, was forcefully disabled. The update was rolled out to customers [in a dot release on the 3rd of September](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/changelog.html#release-v5-26-feature-release). Mattermost Cloud was not generally available at that time, and so was never affected.

The affected SAML implementation was available as a non-default configuration in Mattermost server versions from 5.20.0 up to and including 5.26.1. Mattermost deployments were only vulnerable if all of the following were simultaneously true:

* The server was running a version between 5.20.0 and 5.26.1, released before September 2020. This excludes Extended Support Releases 5.25.5 and above.
* The server was configured to use SAML SSO authentication.
* The setting “Use Improved SAML Library (Beta)” had been explicitly enabled by an administrator.

Details of the security release addressing these vulnerabilities can be found on the [Mattermost Security Updates page](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) under the identifier MMSA-2020-0030.

Since the September dot release, Mattermost products have not been vulnerable. We have no evidence of this issue being ever exploited.

## Impact to the Go ecosystem

We have identified three major open source SAML implementations affected by the Go XML round-trip vulnerabilities: [Dex SAML Connector](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/saml/), [github.com/crewjam/saml](https://github.com/crewjam/saml), and [github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2](https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2). The maintainers of all three projects were included in private embargoed disclosure prior to publishing any details. Maintainers were also given advance access to the github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator repository.

Patches are available in the following releases:

* [Dex IDP version 2.27.0](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/releases)
* [github.com/crewjam/saml version 0.4.3](https://github.com/crewjam/saml/releases)
* [github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2 version 0.6.0](https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/tags)

We have also privately reached out to maintainers of significant applications and products that depend on these SAML implementations and given them an advance warning of today’s disclosure without revealing technical details.

Having an idea of the scale and range of affected products may help in understanding why we’ve gone to such lengths in coordinating this. We reached out to a total of 20 companies and projects in addition to the maintainers of the SAML implementations named above. The affected products include:

* A variety of cloud orchestration tools
* Security products from DFIR to secure access and endpoint management
* A commercial IAM solution from a major cloud hosting company
* Multiple web software frameworks
* Hardware root of trust APIs
* Well-known SaaS products

If you find yourself among the organizations we contacted, we urge you to start patching immediately.

It’s unlikely that we found all affected use cases, libraries, and products, and we may have missed even major ones. Even if you didn’t hear from us but suspect your particular use case of encoding/xml may be affected, please consider reviewing your codebase for vulnerable patterns.

## Upcoming changes in Go

The Go security team is planning changes to `encoding/xml` that address round-trip vulnerabilities by deprecating existing behaviors from a security perspective. A new API is expected to land in Go 1.16 that will allow disabling namespace prefix parsing entirely. The current functionality will remain available, but it will no longer be considered secure for use cases that require round-trip stability; Go will stop accepting vulnerability submissions related to its behavior.

The Go security team has chosen this path after determining that the `encoding/xml` package and its data structures were not designed to make safe round-trips possible. The new API allows them to lower developers’ expectations to a more manageable level, as the support for round-trips in the most problematic cases can be explicitly dropped.

By Mattermost’s estimates this new API will not be a reasonable solution for most use cases currently affected by the vulnerabilities. Parsing and resolving namespaces is an essential requirement for correctly implementing SAML, and even considering only a limited set of real-world SAML messages without strict namespacing requirements would be unlikely to allow for a secure implementation.

Because of this reason, we recommend that affected developers continue using the github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator module even after Go 1.16 becomes available. As a long-term solution, it may make sense to refactor code in a way that avoids encoding round-trips altogether, but it’s unclear if such refactoring is possible in all cases.

### Update 12/13/2020

We just heard from the Go team that there are possibly additional changes coming in a future version.  It’s not clear to us whether these changes fully fix the XML validation issues in Go, but we’re hopeful that these issues will get fully patched in Go in the near future. We have been informed that a public discussion with the Go team will be opened in this issue at <https://golang.org/issue/43168>.

## Disclosure timeline

The first of the XML round-trip vulnerabilities was originally discovered on the 28th of August, 2020, and by the 31st of August Mattermost had traced the root cause to encoding/xml and reached out to the Go security team. The graphic below shows the full timeline from initial discovery to public disclosure. Blue circles represent actions taken by Mattermost, red circles are responses from the Go security team.

# xml-roundtrip-validator

The Go module `github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator` implements mitigations for multiple security issues in Go's `encoding/xml`. Applications that use `encoding/xml` for security-critical operations, such as XML signature validation and SAML, may use the `Validate` and `ValidateAll` functions to avoid impact from malicious XML inputs.

## Usage

### Validate

```
import (
    "strings"

    xrv "github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator"
)

func DoStuffWithXML(input string) {
    if err := xrv.Validate(strings.NewReader(input)); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    // validation succeeded, input is safe
    actuallyDoStuffWithXML(input)
}
```

### ValidateAll

```
import (
    "strings"

    xrv "github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator"
)

func DoStuffWithXML(input string) {
    if errs := xrv.ValidateAll(strings.NewReader(input)); len(errs) != 0 {
        for err := range errs {
            // here you can log each error individually if you like
        }
        return
    }
    // validation succeeded, input is safe
    actuallyDoStuffWithXML(input)
}
```

### CLI

Compiling:

```
$ go build cmd/xrv.go

```

Running:

```
$ ./xrv good.xml
Document validated without errors
$ ./xrv bad.xml
validator: in token starting at 2:5: roundtrip error: expected {{ :Element} []}, observed {{ Element} []}
$ ./xrv -all bad.xml
validator: in token starting at 2:5: roundtrip error: expected {{ :Element} []}, observed {{ Element} []}
validator: in token starting at 3:5: roundtrip error: expected {{ Element} [{{ :attr} z}]}, observed {{ Element} [{{ attr} z}]}

```

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

# SAML authentication vulnerability due to stdlib XML parsing

High

[zwass](/zwass)
published
GHSA-w3wf-cfx3-6gcx
Dec 15, 2020

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<3.5.1

## Patched versions

3.5.1

## Description

### Impact

Due to issues in Go's standard library XML parsing, a valid SAML response may be mutated by an attacker to modify the trusted document. This can result in allowing unverified logins from a SAML IdP.

Users that configure Fleet with SSO login may be vulnerable to this issue.

### Patches

This issue is patched in 3.5.1 using <https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator>.

### Workarounds

If upgrade to 3.5.1 is not possible, users should disable SSO authentication in Fleet.

### References

See <https://mattermost.com/blog/coordinated-disclosure-go-xml-vulnerabilities/> for more information about the underlying vulnerabilities.
