Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26837:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization in a specific functionality within a proprietary language used by the SAP Solution Manager's End-User Experience Monitoring (EEM) application. This lack of sanitization allows for path traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23):** The primary vulnerability is path traversal, allowing an attacker to manipulate file paths to access files outside of the intended directory.
- **Missing Authentication:** While not explicitly stated as a separate vulnerability, the advisory mentions a missing authentication vulnerability alongside the path traversal within the User Experience Monitoring component. This suggests that an attacker, even with unprivileged user access, could exploit the path traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Exfiltration:** An attacker could exfiltrate sensitive information from the SMDAgents, which are the systems running the EEM robots, by reading arbitrary OS files.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker could potentially affect the availability of services from the SMDAgents by exploiting the path traversal vulnerability, potentially rendering EEM robots unusable.
- **Access to Sensitive Information:** The vulnerability can expose usernames and passwords that could be used to access other SAP systems within the landscape

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Scripts:** The attack vector involves uploading malicious scripts using the proprietary language, leveraging the path traversal vulnerability within the language functionality. These scripts are then executed by EEM robots (SMD Agents).
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker does not need physical access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to SolMan:** The attacker needs access to the SAP Solution Manager 7.2.
- **Unprivileged User Access:** An attacker with an unprivileged user account can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Ability to Upload Scripts:** The attacker needs to be able to upload scripts using the proprietary language of EEM.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects SAP Solution Manager 7.2, specifically the End-User Experience Monitoring (EEM) application.
- The vulnerable web service runs on the SAP Java NetWeaver stack.
- The provided CVSS v3 score is 8.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L).
- SAP has released a patch in SAP Note #2983204.
