Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**1. Authenticated Remote Code Execution**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of user-provided input within the settings creation functionality. Specifically, the `parser` setting in the `list` type field is not sanitized, allowing for command injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Command injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An authenticated attacker with developer privileges can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious POST request to `/BigTreeCMS/site/index.php/admin/developer/settings/create/` with a crafted `settings` payload, specifically within the `list` field type's `parser`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a user account with developer privileges within BigTree CMS.

**2. Authenticated SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:**  Lack of proper sanitization of user input in the custom feed creation feature. Specifically the `table` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An authenticated attacker with developer privileges can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious POST request to `/site/index.php/admin/developer/feeds/create/` with a crafted `table` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a user account with developer privileges within BigTree CMS.

**3. Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of user-provided content when creating or updating pages.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored XSS vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An authenticated attacker with editor or publisher privileges can inject arbitrary JavaScript into page content, which can then be executed in the browsers of other users who view those pages.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious POST request to `/BigTreeCMS/site/index.php/admin/pages/update/` containing a crafted script payload within the page content.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a user account with editor or publisher privileges within BigTree CMS.
