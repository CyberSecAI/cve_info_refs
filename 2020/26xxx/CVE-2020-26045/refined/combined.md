## Description

![@0verall](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71753309?v=4&size=48)[0verall](https://github.com/0verall)opened [on Sep 23, 2020](https://github.com/daylightstudio/FUEL-CMS/issues/575#issue-707138024)

FUEL CMS 1.4.11 allows SQL Injection via parameter 'name' in /fuel/permissions/create/

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.
