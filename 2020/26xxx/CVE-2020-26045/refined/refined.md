Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input in the `name` parameter within the `/fuel/permissions/create/` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input in the `name` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could compromise the application by gaining unauthorized access to the database.
- This could lead to the ability to modify or exfiltrate data, or exploit other vulnerabilities in the underlying database system.
- The attacker can potentially gain full control over the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through an HTTP POST request to the `/fuel/permissions/create/` endpoint.
- The attacker injects malicious SQL code via the `name` parameter within the POST request body.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) shows the injection of a malicious payload `a")or extractvalue(1,concat(0x23,user()))#` into the `name` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the application.
- The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint (`/fuel/permissions/create/`) and the vulnerable parameter (`name`).
- It appears the attacker would need to be logged into the FUEL-CMS application.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Github issue #575 provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, including a complete HTTP POST request with the malicious payload.
- The attacker uses a specific SQL injection technique: `extractvalue(1,concat(0x23,user()))` to extract the current database user.
- The issue includes a screenshot of the Burp Suite response, showing the successful execution of the injected SQL query.
