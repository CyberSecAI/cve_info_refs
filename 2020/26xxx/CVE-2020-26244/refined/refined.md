  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The pyoidc library did not properly verify the IdToken signature, allowed the 'none' algorithm in certain flows, did not verify the IdToken automatically and did not check the iat claim for sanity.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The IdToken signature algorithm was not checked automatically, but only if the expected algorithm was passed in as a kwarg.",
      "JWA `none` algorithm was allowed in all flows.",
      "`oic.consumer.Consumer.parse_authz` returns an unverified IdToken. The verification of the token was left to the discretion of the implementator.",
      "`iat` claim was not checked for sanity (i.e. it could be in the future)."
    ],
    "impact": "Client implementations using this library were vulnerable to replay attacks and cipher downgrade.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker could potentially forge an IdToken by exploiting the lack of signature verification or using the 'none' algorithm.",
       "An attacker could potentially replay a captured IdToken.",
       "An attacker could potentially provide an IdToken with a manipulated 'iat' claim, leading to issues with time-based validations."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to intercept or manipulate the authentication flow to inject a crafted or replayed IdToken."
