# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1167337#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2020-03-22 12:57:23 UTC  ``` An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered where malicious code could be used to trigger an XSS attack through retrieving and displaying results.  The attack requires an attacker be able to insert specially-crafted data in to certain database tables, which when retrieved (for instance, through the Browse tab) can trigger the XSS attack.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-10803 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10803)

#### Description

In phpMyAdmin 4.x before 4.9.5 and 5.x before 5.0.2, a SQL injection vulnerability was discovered where malicious code could be used to trigger an XSS attack through retrieving and displaying results (in tbl\_get\_field.php and libraries/classes/Display/Results.php). The attacker must be able to insert crafted data into certain database tables, which when retrieved (for instance, through the Browse tab) can trigger the XSS attack.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1167335#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2020-03-22 12:57:18 UTC  ``` An SQL injection vulnerability was found in how phpMyAdmin retrieves the current username.  A malicious user with access to the server could create a specially-crafted username and then trick the victim in to performing specific actions with that user account (such as editing its privileges).  This flaw also could generate server errors for users with certain characters who try to change their MySQL passwords.  Fixed for phpMyAdmin 4.9.x in 4.9.5  Fixed for phpMyAdmin 5.0.x in 5.0.2  References: <https://www.phpmyadmin.net/security/PMASA-2020-2/> <https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/commit/89fbcd7c39e6b3979cdb2f64aa4cd5f4db27eaad> <https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/commit/3258978c38bee8cb4b99f249dffac9c8aaea2d80> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1167335#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-03-23 22:40:05 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1167335) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/787596> 15.1+Backports:SLE-12 / phpMyAdmin ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1167335#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-03-29 22:17:02 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:0405-1: An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now available.

If an attacker sends a crafted link to the victim with the malicious JavaScript, when the victim clicks on the link, the JavaScript will run and complete the instructions made by the attacker.

You submitted the devel package changes (that will go into openSUSE:Factory) to Maintenance. And how that includes changes done only for Factory. You can do that but you don't actually need to. What is needed for Maintenance is only the 4.9.6 bump, not the fixes for [bug 1170743](show_bug.cgi?id=1170743 "RESOLVED FIXED - phpMyAdmin installation wipes it's sysconfig apache_server_flag entry") or [bug 1092345](show_bug.cgi?id=1092345 "RESOLVED FIXED - phpMyAdmin installs into /srv") (which may be Factory specific) ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1177561#c6)  Eric Schirra   2020-10-12 09:03:11 UTC  ``` Okay. I understand. You are right. Sorry. What should i do? Separat update for all maintened packages? Will remove this request and do a newer. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1177561#c7)  Andreas Stieger   2020-10-12 09:13:34 UTC  ``` Well as a maintainer it is really up to you. If you are willing to include the Factory fixes and think that they are stable for a maintenance update then include them.  But here is my recommendation: Make a maintenance branch, and apply the version bump only. Then submit that. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1177561#c8)  Eric Schirra   2020-10-12 09:34:56 UTC  ``` New request is done. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1177561#c9)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2020-10-12 10:10:07 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1177561) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/841237> 15.1+15.2+Backports:SLE-12+Backports:SLE-15-SP1+Backports:SLE-15-SP2 / phpMyAdmin ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1177561#c10)  OBSbugzilla Bot   2020-10-16 08:50:07 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1177561) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/842058> 15.1+15.2+Backports:SLE-12+Backports:SLE-15-SP1+Backports:SLE-15-SP2 / phpMyAdmin ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1177561#c11)  Andreas Stieger   2020-10-16 08:50:33 UTC  ``` 4.9.6 has a regression, please use 4.9.7 <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/842056> <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/842058> ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1177561#c12)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-10-16 16:16:16 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:1675-1: An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
