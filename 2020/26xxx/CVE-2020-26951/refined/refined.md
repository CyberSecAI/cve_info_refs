Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox and Thunderbird's SVG code. Specifically, when an SVG element containing a `<style>` and `<title>` tag with a malicious payload within the `<title>` tag is processed, the sanitization process is bypassed.  The sanitizer removes the `<style>` element's children, but because the image nodes are disconnected, they load the `src` (which is an empty string), and execute the `onerror` handler. This occurs because event handlers are not properly removed during sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTML Sanitizer Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the HTML sanitizer. The sanitizer fails to remove event handlers within specific SVG structures which allows the injection of malicious code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This is the direct result of the sanitizer bypass, enabling attackers to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Parsing Mismatch:**  A mismatch between parsing and event loading in SVG code allows load events to fire after sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable page.
*   **Bypass of Security Sanitizer:** Successful exploitation allows bypassing the browser's built-in sanitizer.
*   **Privileged Code Execution:** In a privileged context, such as Firefox internal pages or Thunderbird browser-like contexts, the attacker can potentially elevate privileges.
*   **UXSS:** Using the clipboard API, the attacker can execute a UXSS attack by copying the malicious payload and pasting it into a vulnerable context, as demonstrated by the `uxss-svg-style-title.html` attachment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Clipboard API (Paste):** The primary attack vector involves the use of the clipboard to copy and paste a malicious payload.
*   **`innerHTML` Manipulation:** By setting the `innerHTML` property with malicious SVG code, the sanitizer can be bypassed in contexts where `innerHTML` is used.
*   **Exploiting an Existing XSS:** An attacker capable of already injecting malicious code through another XSS vulnerability in a privileged internal page could use this to bypass sanitization, which normally would block the payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject HTML/SVG:** The attacker must have a means to inject the malicious SVG code into a vulnerable area, like a page using innerHTML, the clipboard, or via another XSS vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction (Potentially):** For the clipboard attack, the user would need to copy the malicious payload and then paste it into a vulnerable context.

**Additional Technical Details**

* The vulnerability is specifically triggered when a SVG element contains a `<style>` and a `<title>` tag with an event handler in the `<title>`'s contents.
* The vulnerability impacts not only Firefox but also Thunderbird, due to shared code between the products.
