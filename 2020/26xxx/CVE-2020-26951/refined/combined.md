# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2020-51

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 78.5

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 78.5

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

##### References

* [Bug 1667113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1642028](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1642028)

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

##### References

* [Bug 1656741](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

##### References

* [Bug 1666300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300)

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1669466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

##### References

* [Bug 1672223](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672223)

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

##### References

* [Bug 1672528](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672528)

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

##### References

* [Bug 1661617](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661617)

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1663571](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571)

#### [#CVE-2020-26968: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 83 and Firefox ESR 78.5](#CVE-2020-26968)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Steve Fink, Jason Kratzer, Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 78.5

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 78.5

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Thunderbird's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

##### References

* [Bug 1667113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Thunderbird did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Thunderbird this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Steve Fink, Jason Kratzer, Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

#### [#CVE-2020-26964: Firefox for Android's Remote Debugging via USB could have been abused by untrusted apps on older versions of Android](#CVE-2020-26964)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
low
##### Description

If the Remote Debugging via USB feature was enabled in Firefox for Android on an Android version prior to Android 6.0, untrusted apps could have connected to the feature and operated with the privileges of the browser to read and interact with web content. The feature was implemented as a unix domain socket, protected by the Android SELinux policy; however, SELinux was not enforced for versions prior to 6.0. This was fixed by removing the Remote Debugging via USB feature from affected devices.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

##### Description

Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Byron Campen, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

Attached file
[uxss-svg-style-title.html](attachment.cgi?id=9177645)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9177645&action=edit)

When continuing fuzzing the Firefox Nightly, I found another HTML sanitizer bypass with payload `<svg><style><title>[xss payload]`.

The impact leads to HTML sanitizer bypass on privileged page and UXSS via clipboard API (paste).

Although DOM tree on `document.body.innerHTML` show `<svg><style></style></svg>`, but script execution is still possible.

Several XSS payloads I tested and it works:

* `<svg><style><title><audio src/onerror=alert(14)>`
* `<svg><style><title><img src/onerror=alert(14)>`
* `<svg><style><title><input src type=image onerror=alert(14)>`

*(and another [xss payload] probably will works..)*

## Browser tested:

* Firefox Nightly 83.0a1 (2020-09-23) (64-bit)
* Firefox Release 81.0 (64-bit)
* Firefox ESR 78.3.0esr (64-bit)

## Steps to reproduce:

### HTML sanitizer bypass on privileged page

1. Go to about:config
2. Set `security.csp.enable` boolean from `true` -> `false`
3. Restart Firefox Nightly
4. Go to about:config
5. Open Dev Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I)
6. Click Console tab
7. Paste the code `document.body.innerHTML = "<svg><style><title><audio src/onerror=alert(Components.utils.loadedComponents[0])>"` to the browser console
8. XSS will execute

### UXSS via clipboard API (paste)

1. Download attached file "uxss-svg-style-title.html" (Sorry can't share direct-link, because GCP cloud console outage in Asia)
2. Click Copy Text
3. Go to <https://output.jsbin.com/gocizet/> (TinyMCE Rich Editor form)
4. Paste with Ctrl+V or Right click -> Paste into TinyMCE form
5. XSS will execute [pop alert(document.domain)]

Freddy: there are two bugs here. In the second bug do you know if TinyMCE is using DOMPurify, and maybe a version susceptible to the recently fixed mXSS bugs?

I'm not sure the 1st one is a bug. if you're turning off our defenses it's not a "bypass", and innerHTML doesn't sanitize anything. What does the reporter think is doing the sanitization here?

This is based on <https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2019/12/02/help-test-firefoxs-built-in-html-sanitizer-to-protect-against-uxss-bugs/> - the sanitization is done in the HTML tree sanitizer when assigning to `innerHTML` - so it *should* sanitize things. The reason to turn off CSP is because even when the first line of defense (the HTML sanitization) fails, in about:config there's another one (namely the CSP). We don't use CSP everywhere (for... reasons), so it's worthwhile to find out when the sanitization fails.

> I'm not sure the 1st one is a bug. if you're turning off our defenses it's not a "bypass", and innerHTML doesn't sanitize anything. What does the reporter think is doing the sanitization here?

On the 1st bug I demonstrate bypassing the HTML sanitizer with something that could execute JS by [directly testing the HTML sanitizer](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2019/12/02/help-test-firefoxs-built-in-html-sanitizer-to-protect-against-uxss-bugs/)

In the 1st scenario at step 2 I only disable CSP to demonstrate the payload able to execute the script. (If the CSP not disabled, CSP will block script execution with message "Content Security Policy: The page’s settings blocked the loading of a resource at inline (“default-src”)).

Next on CSP disabled condition, usually after inserting `document.body.innerHTML = "<audio src/onerror=alert(Components.utils.loadedComponents[0])>"` I still received following message (from HTML sanitizer):

```
Removed unsafe attribute. Element: audio. Attribute: onerror. debugger eval code:1
Removed unsafe URI from element attribute. Element: audio. Attribute: src.

```

It shows Firefox sanitizes the HTML markup, preventing script execution.

When I insert `document.body.innerHTML = "<svg><style><title><audio src/onerror=alert(Components.utils.loadedComponents[0])>"` to the browser console, the result I didn't receive warning message from the HTML sanitizer, and onerror script is also executed.

On 2st bug I forgot to mention it not only affect TinyMCE, it also affect other rich editor (with contenteditable & not override browser paste with preventdefault). For demonstration I've created contenteditable HTML on <http://output.jsbin.com/kulewar>.

No, this is not related to code in web content.

We generally need to run a sanitizer upon Copy & Paste. All browsers do, but it's very poorly specified. Indeed, one could demo this on `contenteditable` elements instead of TinyMCE and other editors.

For reference see *non-normative* section on ["Pasting HTML" in the Editor's Draft for Clipboard API](https://w3c.github.io/clipboard-apis/#pasting-html) or our code at <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/670e13b51d272125c76a1bf84b9f3707583cde12/editor/libeditor/HTMLEditorDataTransfer.cpp#3543>

Without testing, my guess is that we remove element children of SVG `style` but since disconnected image nodes load their `src` for compat with Netscape <= 4.x, we end up loading processing the loading for the empty-string `src` and running the `onerror` handler.

Perhaps we need to change node removal in the sanitizer to iterate over the subtree rooted at the node being removed and remove all attributes in it.

Hi Daniel, thank you for set the severity to high.

Hi (In reply to Daniel Veditz [:dveditz] from [comment #8](/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - mXSS payload (combined svg, style, title element) lead to HTML Sanitizer Bypass and XSS via Clipboard API (paste)"))

Sorry if this was duplicate to [bug 1666300](/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300 "VERIFIED FIXED - XSS via paste and Clipboard API and SVG + image onerror handler"), because on [bug 166300](/show_bug.cgi?id=166300 "VERIFIED DUPLICATE - right click on an image should have a view imagein new window and/or view image full screen option."), I discovered XSS payload `<svg><style><image href=1 onerror=alert(document.domain)>` execute uXSS on paste and able to bypass the sanitizer (refer to ticket 1666777).

While I'm keep fuzzing on the same root HTML element `<svg><style>`, I'm unable to find another XSS payload pair (e.g. <audio>, <img>, <input>) to execute the onevent handler, only `<image href=1 onerror=alert(document.domain)>` works that able to execute. I was think it probably caused by Firefox implementation on `<image href>` on SVG as Frederik also said on ticket 166300.

On the next day, while I'm fuzzing HTML element `<svg><style><title>[xss payload]`, surprisingly it execute the HTML element (on [xss payload] e.g. `<audio>`, `<img>`, `<input>`) onevent handler. Also only `<title>` element tree works, when I tried replace `<title`> with another HTML element (e.g. `<head>`, `<body>`, and more..) it won't execute.

After that when changing HTML element tree on [xss payload] to `<svg><style><title><image href=1 onerror=alert(document.domain)>` as payload on [bug 166300](/show_bug.cgi?id=166300 "VERIFIED DUPLICATE - right click on an image should have a view imagein new window and/or view image full screen option."), the onevent handler won't execute.

From my perspective the payload `<svg><style><title>[xss payload]` is different from [bug 166300](/show_bug.cgi?id=166300 "VERIFIED DUPLICATE - right click on an image should have a view imagein new window and/or view image full screen option.") `<svg><style><image href=1 onerror=alert(document.domain)`, it's reason why I created new ticket ([bug 1667113](/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113 "VERIFIED FIXED - mXSS payload (combined svg, style, title element) lead to HTML Sanitizer Bypass and XSS via Clipboard API (paste)")).

Although payload is different, but both [bug 166300](/show_bug.cgi?id=166300 "VERIFIED DUPLICATE - right click on an image should have a view imagein new window and/or view image full screen option.") and [bug 1667113](/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113 "VERIFIED FIXED - mXSS payload (combined svg, style, title element) lead to HTML Sanitizer Bypass and XSS via Clipboard API (paste)") is relying on same root HTML element `<svg><style>`. Which make me believe when Mozilla team fix bug on ticket 166300, this bug will fixed too.

In the former case, the event handler attributes are actually stripped from the element.

Ah I see, so in the `<style>` case the sanitizer removes the whole `<img>` while in `<foreignObject`> case it only removes the attribute. [Comment #5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - mXSS payload (combined svg, style, title element) lead to HTML Sanitizer Bypass and XSS via Clipboard API (paste)") seems to make sense to prevent this.

The patch currently attached to [bug 1666300](/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300 "VERIFIED FIXED - XSS via paste and Clipboard API and SVG + image onerror handler") fixes the XSS part of this (i.e. the event handler part) but the fetch is still attempted but gets blocked by CSP. If we wanted to prevent the fetch attempt that now gets blocked by CSP, we'd probably need to deoptimize the chrome `innerHTML` setter to parse into a throw-away "loaded as data" document.

Unclear how we should proceed given that it would be defense in depth with a perf cost.

I think we can live with the fetch being attempted for now. As I've said elsewhere, the flags we use for automatic chrome sanitization doesn't remove images, and the sanitizer won't remove [http:/https](http:///https): URIs, anyway, which I think are the most likely ones to be able to cause side-effects.

That said, I think fragment parsing in chrome documents should probably be an uncommon enough thing at this point that we can probably afford parsing into a data document as long as we don't create a new one each time. Node adoption should be relatively cheap, especially if we haven't created JS reflectors for the nodes.

In the DOM Core meeting, we leaned towards using a throw-away doc despite the cost of moving the nodes to another doc upon insertion.

You don't need to disable the CSP to test this.

Instead of having the script actually fire, you can observe the `csp-on-violate-policy` topic like we do in <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/9c72508fcf2bba709a5b5b9eae9da35e0c707baa/dom/security/test/csp/test_link_rel_preload.html#21>

Sadly, we'll need to rely on just "loaded as data" without further attempts to make the throw-away doc have a null principal, a bogus URL, or no script handling object. Attempts to make the document abnormal like that trips up our previous security mechanisms.

* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: No
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: Either the same patch applies or it will be a mechanical rebase.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Not very likely: Regressions are likely to break the entire mochitest test harness (and did during development), so now that the harness works again, I expect things to be OK.

Is it certain that the backed-out changesets are to blame? I see `browser_parsable_css.js` fail in directory iteration, and a Pernosco trace indicates that it doesn't even get far enough to run the code added here.

Hmm. Before getting to what it actually wants to test, the test first iterates over *lots* of files and directories in JS, which is very slow in a debug build and even slower under rr. This takes such a long time, that it probably just timed out for me. I'll try a new Pernosco run with the timeout increased.

FWIW, in case it's helpful, <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=autoland&group_state=expanded&selectedTaskRun=S_VZPZjoQM2arxf3psr85g.0&resultStatus=success%2Ctestfailed%2Cbusted%2Cexception&searchStr=os%2Cx%2C10.14%2Copt%2Cmochitests%2Ctest-macosx1014-64%2Fopt-mochitest-browser-chrome-e10s%2Cbc3&revision=e09fe2a6602b0c8d0b9ceb5f869456f01cefa445> shows that the failure is that line 511 in `checkAllTheCSS` fails.

```
  doc.head.innerHTML = "";

```

which threw an NS\_ERROR\_FAILURE exception (which is confusing; using an empty string to clear out an element shouldn't even really be invoking any sanitizer code, I wouldn't have thought?).

Edit: Oh, and this is the content document of an iframe which we remove from the DOM on the previous line.

It also failed on Linux and Windows and on opt builds, so it should be straightforward to reproduce locally on a non-debug build? I wouldn't be surprised if it also reproduced if you reduced the number of files it loads.

Yeah, the [iframe removal](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/ff85081e3b05f89f9a5921b489b6e01ed4a88c25/browser/base/content/test/static/browser_parsable_css.js#510) sets the script global object to `nullptr`. Since per review we error out if that has happened, we error out.

Thanks Mozilla Team for the patch, I confirmed the issue has been resolved on Firefox Nightly 84.0a1 (2020-10-23) (64-bit).

But when [directly testing the HTML sanitizer](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2019/12/02/help-test-firefoxs-built-in-html-sanitizer-to-protect-against-uxss-bugs/) I notice that I no longer received any warning message from Firefox sanitizer (e.g. “Removed unsafe attribute. Element: img. Attribute: onerror.”) or CSP error message (e.g. "Content Security Policy: The page’s settings blocked the loading of a resource at inline (“default-src”)).

Since this is "worse" because he shows the sanitizer is affected, and is requesting a bounty, I don't want to call it an outright duplicate. I'll leave it "depends on" for now, but probably for bounty purposes there's only one bug here (and we'll take the worst form of it).

No there no issue with CSP error message, it's my fault by submit payload `document.body.innerHTML = "<img src=x>"` which doesn't trigger CSP error message. Regarding to the sanitizer, I haven't found another sanitizer bypass.

I only notice I no longer received any warning message from Firefox sanitizer (e.g. “Removed unsafe attribute. Element: img. Attribute: onerror.”).
