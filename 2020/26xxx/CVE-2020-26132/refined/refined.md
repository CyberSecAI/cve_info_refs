Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insecure folder permissions on the default installation directory of "Home DNS Server" V0.10. Specifically, the directory `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\HomeDNSServer\` allows any "Authenticated User" to modify its contents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Permissions:** The primary weakness is the overly permissive access control on the installation directory, granting write access to all authenticated users. This deviates from the principle of least privilege.
- **Unprotected Executable:** The `HomeDNSServer.exe` binary within the installation directory is vulnerable to being replaced due to the insecure permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can replace the legitimate `HomeDNSServer.exe` with a malicious binary. When the service is started (manually or via reboot), the attacker's code will execute with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute any code on the target system with the highest privilege level.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the vulnerable machine. An attacker must be able to log in as an authenticated user.
- **File Replacement:** The attacker's method of exploitation involves replacing a legitimate executable with a malicious one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the target system to access and modify the installation folder.
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to write to the file system in the specific installation directory (`%SYSTEMDRIVE%\HomeDNSServer\`).
- **No specific knowledge:** The attack does not require prior knowledge of service internals. It does require the user to understand the file system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content indicates that the vulnerability was reported to the vendor, but there was no response, and no patch.
- The recommended workaround is to change the installation directory to `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Program Files\` or `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Program Files(x86)\` which have more restrictive default permissions.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management.
