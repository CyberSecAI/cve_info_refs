  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of HPGL files, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated data structure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data during HPGL file parsing.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a user opening a malicious HPGL file or visiting a malicious webpage.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious file or visit a malicious webpage. No special privileges are required."
