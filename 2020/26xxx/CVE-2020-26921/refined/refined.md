The provided content is related to CVE-2020-26921. It describes an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting certain NETGEAR Smart Managed Plus switches.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The document states "NETGEAR has released fixes for an authentication bypass security vulnerability" but does not detail the root cause.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Authentication Bypass vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The advisory mentions a CVSS v3 score of 8.3 with a vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H which suggests:
    *   **Confidentiality:** Low
    *   **Integrity:** High
    *   **Availability:** High
