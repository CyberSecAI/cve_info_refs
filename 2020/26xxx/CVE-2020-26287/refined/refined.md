Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2020-26287:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way HedgeDoc handles mermaid diagrams. It was discovered that arbitrary script tags could be injected into the notes through mermaid diagrams because the content was being rendered using innerHTML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application was not properly sanitizing user-supplied input when rendering mermaid diagrams, which allowed for the injection of malicious script tags.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary javascript code, which would be executed in the context of a victim's browser when they viewed the note containing the malicious mermaid diagram.
- The provided content mentions the use of google-analytics.com and Google Tag Manager to facilitate the injection of arbitrary JavaScript due to the Content Security Policy (CSP) allowing this domain.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would insert a specially crafted mermaid diagram into a HedgeDoc note. The mermaid diagram would include a script tag that references a location hosting malicious javascript. This note would then be reported to an admin or be viewed by other users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or edit notes in HedgeDoc. In some configurations, this may not require authentication.
- The attacker needs to craft a mermaid diagram containing a malicious script tag.
- The attacker could use Google Tag Manager to inject javascript into the victim's browser due to the CSP allowing `www.google-analytics.com`.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found by Alessandro Mizzaro (Alemmi).
- The fix involves changing how mermaid diagrams are rendered to not use innerHTML.
- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 1.7.1.
