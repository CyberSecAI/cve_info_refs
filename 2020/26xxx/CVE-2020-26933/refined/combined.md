Title: Improper initialization of Non-orderly TPM shut-down may result in susceptibility to dictionary attack
vulnerability

ID: TCG-SA-2020-001

Released: Original: 2020-11-10 Last Revised: 2020-11-10

Related CVE ID's and associated CVSSv3 vector and score
CVE: CVE-2020-26933

CVSS base score: 7.2 High

CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

CWE-665: Improper Initialization

Overview
A vulnerability was found in the reference code of Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Trusted Platform
Module (TPM) 2.0 Library Specification Revisions 1.38 and 1.59 which could potentially impact the TPM
implementation of non-orderly shutdown-failedTries with the USE_DA_USED build flag.

Description
The reference code does not correctly implement the behavior described in the aforementioned
specifications if a DA protected object is accessed after a TPM2_Shutdown(). In this case, the NV flag
(indicating that access to a DA protected object occurred during this boot cycle) is not set correctly. When
a power loss happens, failedTries is not incremented on the next TPM2_Startup().

The check and increment of failedTries on TPM2_Startup() ensures that a failed authorization attempt is
recorded by the TPM (e.g. because NV memory is unavailable).

Impact
Exploitation on vulnerable systems may result in local information disclosure or escalation of privileges.

Exposure of this issue is on TPM implementations where the NVM device may be measured or controlled
by an attacker.

Solution and Protective Measures
Review and implement TCG publications: Errata 1.11 for revision 1.38 in section 2.36 and Errata 1.1 for
revision 1.59 in section 2.2.

## **TCG Vulnerability Disclosure Policy**

## **Overview**

The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) as a standards organization is committed to receiving and responding to reports of potential vulnerabilities in TCG-developed technologies such as specifications, reference code, and reference documents. Our goal is to provide our adopters with timely information, guidance, and mitigation options to address vulnerabilities. The TCG Vulnerability Response Team (VRT) is chartered and responsible for coordinating the response and disclosure of specification vulnerabilities that are reported to TCG.

#### Security Advisories

## **Reporting security vulnerabilities**

TCG recommends that reporters also contact the Vulnerability Response Teams for the vendor whose implementation contains the potential issue. You can find a list of TCG member company response teams below.

| UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) | [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) | https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/vulnerability-reporting |

If you identify a vulnerability in our specifications, reference code, and reference documents please report it immediately. Reports can be sent to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#196a7c7a6c6b706d60596d6b6c6a6d7c7d7a7674696c6d70777e7e6b766c6937766b7e). Timely identification of security vulnerabilities is critical to mitigating potential risks to our adopters. When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much of the below information to help us better understand the nature and scope of the reported issue:

* Finder’s email
* Vulnerability Description (Include vulnerability details and how to reproduce the issue)
* The version label for the affected software or document
* Finder’s PGP public key if available or via standard means

Please note that the TCG is currently limited to inquiries and responses written in English.

## **Handling security vulnerabilities**

TCG monitors for submissions and acknowledges initial receipt within 3 business days. The vulnerability response activities will be tailored to the circumstances and will generally proceed as follows: 1) Triage report 2) Remediation determined 3) Communication plan 4) Mitigation 5) Response.

TCG strives to provide the remedy or corrective action in the shortest commercially reasonable time. Response timelines will depend on many factors, such as the severity, the remedy complexity, the affected component (e.g., some updates require longer validation cycles or can only be updated in a major release), or the stage of the product within its lifecycle, among others. TCG VRT will coordinate with the finder throughout the vulnerability investigation and provide the finder with updates on case progress.

## **Coordinated Disclosure Practices**

TCG follows multi-party coordinated disclosure practices, under which vulnerabilities are generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are made available to customers. This allows the vendors the opportunity to triage and offer tested updates, workarounds, or other corrective measures before any involved party discloses detailed vulnerability or exploit information to the public. Multi-party coordinated disclosure industry best practices is designed to protect technology adopters. Public disclosure of a potential vulnerability before mitigations are deployed could allow adversaries to exploit the vulnerability.

In most cases, TCG will disclose mitigations through TCG Security Advisories where applicable. The TCG Security Advisories will typically include the following information:

* Date of publication
* CVE ID’s
* CVSS v3.1 scoring
* Details of the vulnerability in the affected TCG specification and potential impacts
* Erratum
  + Remediation or workaround, if any (link)
* Acknowledge the finder and/or the finder’s organization

**Severity Rating**

A security vulnerability is classified by its severity rating, which is determined by many factors, including the level of effort required to exploit a vulnerability as well as the potential impact to data or business activities from a successful exploit. TCG uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) to identify the severity level of identified vulnerabilities. The [full standard](https://www.first.org/cvss) is maintained by FIRST.

**Disclaimer**

This Vulnerability Response Policy (“Policy”) does not constitute a warranty or alter the terms of any license with respect to any TCG-developed technology.  TCG reserves the right to change or update this Policy without notice at any time and on a case-by-case basis.  Response is not guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues. Your use of the information in this Policy or materials linked from the Policy is at your own risk.
