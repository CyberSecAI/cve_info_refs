Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26933:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the incorrect implementation of the TPM's behavior related to Domain Authorization (DA) protected objects after a `TPM2_Shutdown()` call in the reference code of the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 Library Specification Revisions 1.38 and 1.59 when the `USE_DA_USED` build flag is enabled. Specifically, the NV flag, which indicates access to a DA protected object during the current boot cycle, is not set correctly. This leads to `failedTries` not being incremented upon the next `TPM2_Startup()` after a power loss.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Improper Initialization (CWE-665):** The NV flag, responsible for tracking access to DA-protected objects, is not initialized correctly after a `TPM2_Shutdown()` call, leading to inconsistent state.
-   **Inconsistent State:** After a non-orderly shutdown (e.g., power loss), the `failedTries` counter may not be properly updated, as the NV flag does not reflect previous access to DA-protected objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Local Information Disclosure:** An attacker might gain access to information that should be protected by the TPM's DA mechanism.
-   **Escalation of Privileges:** By exploiting the incorrect handling of failed authorization attempts, an attacker could potentially escalate their privileges on a vulnerable system.
-   **Dictionary Attack:** The vulnerability makes the system susceptible to dictionary attacks by not enforcing lockout mechanisms on failed authentication attempts.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploited locally, implying that the attacker needs to have physical or local access to the vulnerable machine.
-   **Non-Orderly Shutdown:** The vulnerability is exposed during a non-orderly shutdown event (e.g., power loss).
-   **NVM Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploitable where the Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) device is controlled or measured by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the target system.
-   **Control/Measurement of NVM:** The attacker needs the ability to control or measure the Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) where the TPM stores its data.
-   **Technical Understanding:**  The attacker requires a deep understanding of the TPM internals and its Domain Authorization mechanisms.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in TPM implementations where the NVM device may be measured or controlled by an attacker.
-  The fix involves implementing errata 1.11 for revision 1.38 and errata 1.1 for revision 1.59.
-  The vulnerability was found by Intel Corporation.
- The CVSS score is 7.2 High with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N.
