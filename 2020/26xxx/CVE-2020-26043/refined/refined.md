The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities found in Hoosk v1.8.0, specifically in the `install/index.php` file. These vulnerabilities include Remote Code Execution (RCE), SQL Injection (SQLI), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**1. Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

*   **Root Cause:** User input provided through the `siteURL` parameter is directly written into the `config.php` file without sanitization or proper encoding.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Unrestricted file write with unsanitized user input.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary PHP code execution on the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/install/index.php` with malicious PHP code injected into the `siteURL` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**2. SQL Injection (SQLI)**
*   **Root Cause:** User input provided through the `siteName` parameter is concatenated into an SQL query string without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection vulnerability through unsanitized user input in SQL queries.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database server, which could lead to data exfiltration, modification or deletion, or other malicious activity depending on database privileges. In this case, the `version()` SQL function is executed.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/install/index.php` with malicious SQL code injected into the `siteName` parameter.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
*   **Root Cause:** User input provided through `siteName` and `siteURL` parameters are not properly sanitized before being used within the application.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** XSS vulnerability due to lack of proper sanitization of user-provided data.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Malicious JavaScript code execution in a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, and defacement, among other actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending crafted POST requests to `/install/index.php` with malicious JavaScript code in the `siteName` or `siteURL` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
