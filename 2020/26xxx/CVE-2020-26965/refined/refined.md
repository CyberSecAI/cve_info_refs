Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-26965:

**CVE-2020-26965**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how software keyboards handle the change of an input field's type attribute. When a password field (`<input type="password">`) is dynamically changed to a text field (`<input type="text">`), for instance, via a "show password" feature, the software keyboard switches from its password layout to a non-password layout.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Exposed Input History**: Software keyboards may store input history, so switching to a non-password layout might cause the keyboard to learn the user's password, even if the original field was a password type.
    *   **Inconsistent Keyboard Layout**: The switch in keyboard layouts can be unexpected, potentially leading to user confusion and privacy issues.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Password Exposure**: If an attacker can trick a user into revealing a password using a "show password" function, or modify the input field dynamically, the user's password may be stored in the software keyboard's history.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Websites**: A website can manipulate input types dynamically using JavaScript when a password is entered and shown, without the user's knowledge that the input is now of a type that may store history.
    *  **"Show Password" Feature**: When users click the "show password" feature (which changes the input field type), the software keyboard may save the password.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to control or have influence over a website that allows for input type changes.
    *  No physical access is required however an attacker would need to trick a user to input their password when the input type is a text field.

**Additional Context from the Provided Bugzilla Data:**

*   **Affected Products:** This issue affects Firefox and Thunderbird (and other Mozilla products that use the same core code), particularly on Android and other platforms with software keyboards.
*  **Mitigation**: The fix involves preserving the password keyboard layout when the input type is changed dynamically from password to text in the described scenario using a `hasBeenTypePassword` property.
*  **Severity**: The severity of this vulnerability is considered low, as an attacker would require a user to perform specific interactions to potentially expose the password through the keyboard's learning mechanisms.
*   **Publicly Visible:** The bug report and related details are publicly accessible, indicating transparency in handling the vulnerability.
