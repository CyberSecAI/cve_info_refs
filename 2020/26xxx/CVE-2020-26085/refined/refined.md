- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of message contents.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an authenticated, remote attacker to execute programs on a targeted system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user account running the Cisco Jabber client software.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends specially crafted XMPP messages to the affected software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send XMPP messages to end-user systems running Cisco Jabber, potentially requiring access to the same XMPP domain or another method of access to send messages to clients.
