{
  "CVE-2020-26273": {
    "Description": "By using sqlite's `ATTACH` verb, someone with administrative access to osquery can cause reads and writes to arbitrary sqlite databases on disk. This *does* allow arbitrary files to be created, but they will be sqlite databases. It does not appear to allow existing non-sqlite files to be overwritten.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the osquery application's use of the SQLite `ATTACH` command without proper authorization, which allows an attacker to attach arbitrary SQLite databases.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
      "Improper restriction of operations within the SQLite database"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with administrative access to osquery can use the `ATTACH` command to create or modify SQLite database files on the system, potentially leading to arbitrary data manipulation and creation of new SQLite database files.",
    "Attack vectors": "By using sqlite's `ATTACH` verb through osquery's administrative interface.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Administrative access to osquery is required to exploit this vulnerability."
  }
