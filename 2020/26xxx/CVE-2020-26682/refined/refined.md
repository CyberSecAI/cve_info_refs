Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-26682:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A signed integer overflow occurs within the `outline_stroke` function, specifically during calculations related to the outline processing of ASS/SSA subtitle files. This overflow leads to a negative value, causing an assertion failure (`rad >= eps`) and program termination.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Signed Integer Overflow:** The core issue is the lack of proper bounds checking which results in a signed integer overflow during calculations in the `outline_stroke` function. The `FT_Pos` type is a fixed point representation that could be truncated when used with functions expecting `int`.
- **Assertion Failure:** While not a vulnerability itself, the assertion failure (`rad >= eps`) within the `outline_stroke` function highlights the consequences of the integer overflow and serves as a mechanism to discover the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash due to the assertion failure, leading to a denial of service. The program using the library is terminated.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Gentoo security advisory mentions "User-assisted execution of arbitrary code", suggesting that this overflow might be exploitable in some way beyond DoS, but the technical details are not present in the provided documents.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Subtitle Files:** The attack vector is through specially crafted ASS/SSA subtitle files which can be loaded into a player or application using the vulnerable libass library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File Creation:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted ASS/SSA subtitle file that triggers the integer overflow.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to induce a user to load this malicious subtitle file through an application linked to the vulnerable `libass` library.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves implementing checks to ensure that point coordinates remain within predefined ranges, preventing the integer overflows. It appears that `abs` was replaced with `labs` to avoid potential truncation of `FT_Pos` values.
- The vulnerability was fixed in libass version 0.15.0.
- There's a discussion regarding the usage of `abs` vs `labs` in the context of `FT_Pos`, suggesting a potential issue with implicit type conversions.
- The issue was initially discovered through fuzzing.
- The vulnerability is described as both "local" and "remote" exploitable which depends on the nature of the application using `libass`.

In summary, CVE-2020-26682 stems from a signed integer overflow within libass when processing specific ASS/SSA subtitle files. This can lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution with a malicious subtitle file as the attack vector.
