### @MrSmile **[MrSmile](/MrSmile)** commented [Sep 27, 2020](#issue-709639267)

I've added a couple of checks for overflows in outline pipeline. Should fix [#431](https://github.com/libass/libass/issues/431), but I'm not familiar with that fuzzing business so I can't ascertain it for now.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Can confirm that this fixes [#431](https://github.com/libass/libass/issues/431).  Overflow checks seem fine to me. *(Assuming `abs(OUTLINE_MAX) < abs(OUTLINE_MIN)` will stay true in future version, which it probably will, I guess)* |

| Assuming `abs(OUTLINE_MAX) < abs(OUTLINE_MIN)` will stay true in future version, which it probably will, I guess  Maybe it's even better to get rid of `OUTLINE_MIN` altogether and use `-OUTLINE_MAX` instead. |

| FT docs specify that `FT_Pos` is 16.16 or 26.6 fixed-point representation, so I'm not sure what's better, to cast into `int32_t` or use `labs` here. |

| Just use `labs`. In a way, this will also serve as a sanity check to ensure the FT docs aren’t lying. |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).

# libass: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **202012-12**

A vulnerability has been found in libass that could allow a remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libass** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.15.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.15.0** |

### Background

libass is a portable subtitle renderer for the ASS/SSA (Advanced
Substation Alpha/Substation Alpha) subtitle format.

### Description

It was discovered that libass did not properly handle Advanced
Substation Alpha/Substation Alpha subtitle format files.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to process an a specially crafted
subtitle format file using an application linked against libass, possibly
resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libass users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libass-0.15.0"

```
