Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26235:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of the non-thread-safe functions `getenv` and `setenv` within the `time` crate's `localtime_r` function. This function may data race with `std::env::set_var` in the Rust standard library (`libstd`) when different threads are involved.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Data Race:** Concurrent access to environment variables by `localtime_r` and `std::env::set_var` leads to a data race, potentially causing undefined behavior.
- **Dangling Pointer Dereference:**  In specific scenarios, this data race can result in a dangling pointer, leading to a segmentation fault (segfault).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Segmentation Fault (Segfault):**  A successful exploit can cause the application to crash due to a segfault, leading to denial of service.
- **Undefined Behavior:** Data races can cause unpredictable application behavior, potentially corrupting data or leading to other unexpected issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Multithreaded Applications:** The vulnerability is triggered in multithreaded applications where different threads concurrently interact with the environment (i.e., setting environment variables) and use the affected `time` crate functions.
- **Third-Party Libraries:** The issue can occur in a third-party library which uses the `time` crate, without the user's direct knowledge.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to influence the program execution to set environment variables in one thread while triggering the affected `time` crate functions in a different thread. This often is not directly achievable by a remote attacker without another vulnerability.
- Exploitation can occur from within the application itself, e.g., by a malicious library being included. The program must be running on a Unix-like system and be multithreaded.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects versions 0.1, >= 0.2.7, and < 0.2.23 of the `time` crate.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in versions >= 0.2.23 of the `time` crate.
- **Workarounds:**
   - Library authors should ensure the affected methods are only called when a single thread is running.
   - Binary authors may need to do the same or ensure no other threads are changing the environment.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 5.3 (Moderate), with the following characteristics:
  - Attack Vector: Network
  - Attack Complexity: High
  - Privileges Required: Low
  - User Interaction: None
  - Scope: Unchanged
  - Confidentiality: None
  - Integrity: None
  - Availability: High
- **Non-Unix platforms** such as Windows and WASM are unaffected.
