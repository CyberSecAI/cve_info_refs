## 📚 Project Definition

BookStack is an opinionated documentation platform that provides a pleasant and simple out-of-the-box experience. New users to an instance should find the experience intuitive and only basic word-processing skills should be required to get involved in creating content on BookStack. The platform should provide advanced power features to those that desire it but they should not interfere with the core simple user experience.

BookStack is not designed as an extensible platform to be used for purposes that differ to the statement above.

In regard to development philosophy, BookStack has a relaxed, open & positive approach. At the end of the day this is free software developed and maintained by people donating their own free time.

You can read more about the project and its origins in [our FAQ here](https://www.bookstackapp.com/about/project-faq/).

## 🛠️ Development & Testing

Please see our [development docs](/BookStackApp/BookStack/blob/development/dev/docs/development.md) for full details regarding work on the BookStack source code.

If you're just looking to customize or extend your own BookStack instance, take a look at our [Hacking BookStack documentation page](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/hacking-bookstack/) for details on various options to achieve this without altering the BookStack source code.

Details about BookStack's versioning scheme and the general release process [can be found here](/BookStackApp/BookStack/blob/development/dev/docs/release-process.md).

## 🌎 Translations

Translations for text within BookStack is managed through the [BookStack project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/bookstack). Some strings have colon-prefixed variables such as `:userName`. Leave these values as they are as they will be replaced at run-time.

Please use [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/bookstack) to contribute translations instead of opening a pull request. The translations within the working codebase can be out-of-date, and merging via code can cause conflicts & sync issues. If for some reason you can't use Crowdin feel free to open an issue to discuss alternative options.

If you'd like a new language to be added to Crowdin, for you to be able to provide translations for, please [open a new issue here](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/new?template=language_request.yml).

Please note, translations in BookStack are provided to the "Crowdin Global Translation Memory" which helps BookStack and other projects with finding translations. If you are not happy with contributing to this then providing translations to BookStack, even manually via GitHub, is not advised.

## 🎁 Contributing, Issues & Pull Requests

Feel free to [create issues](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/new/choose) to request new features or to report bugs & problems. Just please follow the template given when creating the issue.

Pull requests are welcome but, unless it's a small tweak, it may be best to open the pull request early or create an issue for your intended change to discuss how it will fit into the project and plan out the merge. Just because a feature request exists, or is tagged, does not mean that feature would be accepted into the core project.

Pull requests should be created from the `development` branch since they will be merged back into `development` once done. Please do not build from or request a merge into the `release` branch as this is only for publishing releases. If you are looking to alter CSS or JavaScript content please edit the source files found in `resources/`. Any CSS or JS files within `public` are built from these source files and therefore should not be edited directly.

The project's code of conduct [can be found here](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/blob/development/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 🔒 Security

Security information for administering a BookStack instance can be found on the [documentation site here](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/security/).

If you'd like to be notified of new potential security concerns you can [sign-up to the BookStack security mailing list](https://updates.bookstackapp.com/signup/bookstack-security-updates).

If you would like to report a security concern, details of doing so [can be found here](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/blob/development/.github/SECURITY.md).

## ♿ Accessibility

We want BookStack to remain accessible to as many people as possible. We aim for at least WCAG 2.1 Level A standards where possible although we do not strictly test this upon each release. If you come across any accessibility issues please feel free to open an issue.

```
This filters out potentially malicious javascript: or data: uri's coming
through to be attached to attachments.
Added tests to cover.

Thanks to Yassine ABOUKIR ([@yassineaboukir](https://github.com/yassineaboukir) on twitter) for reporting this
vulnerability.

# Beta Security Release v0.30.4

![Dan Brown](/images/dan.jpg) Dan Brown posted on the 31st of October 2020

XSS and user-injected auto-redirect vulnerabilities have been found within the page content & attachment components of BookStack which BookStack v0.30.4 looks to address. These are primarily a concern if untrusted users can edit content on your BookStack instance.

* [Update instructions](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/updates)
* [GitHub release page](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.30.4)

### Impact

1. A user with permissions to edit a page could insert JavaScript code through the use of `javascript:` URIs within a link or form which would run, within the context of the current page, when clicked or submitted.
2. A user with permissions to edit a page could insert a particular meta tag which could be used to silently redirect users to a alternative location upon visit of a page.
3. A user with permissions to edit a page could add an attached link which would execute untrusted JavaScript code when clicked by a viewer of the page.

### Patches

The issues were addressed in BookStack v0.30.4.

Dangerous content may remain in the database. The in-page vulnerabilities will be removed before being displayed on a page but dangerous attachment content will remain if exploited. If you think this could have been exploited you can search for potential cases with the following SQL commands:

| ``` [1](#hl-0-1) [2](#hl-0-2) [3](#hl-0-3) [4](#hl-0-4) [5](#hl-0-5) [6](#hl-0-6) [7](#hl-0-7) [8](#hl-0-8)  ``` | ``` # XSS within page content: select * from pages where html like '%javascript:%'; # Auto-redirect within page content: select * from pages where html like '%<meta%'; # XSS in page link attachments: select a.name as attachment_name, p.name as page_name, p.id as page_id from attachments a left join pages p on (a.uploaded_to=p.id) where a.path like '%javascript:%';  ``` |
| --- | --- |

### Workarounds

Page edit permissions could be limited to only those that are trusted until you can upgrade although this will not address existing exploitation of this vulnerability.

# Cross-Site Scripting Through Link Attachments

GHSA-7p2j-4h6p-cq3h
Oct 31, 2020

## Package

BookStack

## Affected versions

< v0.30.4

## Patched versions

v0.30.4

## Description

### Impact

A user with permissions to edit a page could add an attached link which would execute untrusted JavaScript code when clicked by a viewer of the page.

### Patches

The issue was addressed in BookStack v0.30.4.

Dangerous content may remain in the database after this update. If you think this could have been exploited you can search your database for potential cases with the following SQL command:

```
select a.name as attachment_name, p.name as page_name, p.id as page_id from attachments a left join pages p on (a.uploaded_to=p.id) where a.path like '%javascript:%';
```
### Workarounds

Page edit permissions could be limited to only those that are trusted until you can upgrade although this will not address existing exploitation of this vulnerability.
