Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2020-52

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 78.5

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 78.5

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Thunderbird's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

##### References

* [Bug 1667113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1642028](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1642028)

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

##### References

* [Bug 1656741](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

##### References

* [Bug 1666300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300)

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Thunderbird did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1669466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Thunderbird this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

##### References

* [Bug 1672223](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672223)

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

##### References

* [Bug 1672528](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672528)

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

##### References

* [Bug 1661617](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661617)

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1663571](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571)

#### [#CVE-2020-26968: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 78.5](#CVE-2020-26968)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Steve Fink, Jason Kratzer, Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

The Google Chrome team is fixing a heap buffer overflow in freetype. Although our library is called FreeType2 the affected code appears the same. I have not yet tested this in an ASAN build to verify if we are affected, but according to Google Project Zero they have found this being exploited in the wild (against Chrome, presumably)

Calling this sec-critical for now assuming we're affected, and setting the security group to the least-restrictive "Release Track" so it's visible to more people if we have to chemspill.

(it was reported to Chrome yesterday, so 6 days left)

From crbug 1139963:

A vulnerability exists in the function `Load_SBit_Png`, which processes PNG

images embedded into fonts. This function:

1. Obtains the image width and height from the header as 32-bit integers.
2. Truncates the obtained values to 16 bit and stores them in a

   `TT_SBit_Metrics` structure.
3. Uses the truncated values to calculate the bitmap size.
4. Allocates the backing store of that size.
5. Passes `png_struct` and the backing store to a libpng function.

The issue is that libpng uses the original 32-bit values, which are saved in

`png_struct`. Therefore, if the original width and/or height are greater than

65535, the allocated buffer won't be able to fit the bitmap

```

In the announcement that went out for the 2.10.4 release containing this fix, they said if affects anybody who has FT\_CONFIG\_OPTION\_USE\_PNG set. AFAICT, that includes us?

As far as I'm aware, `Load_SBit_Png` will be used for opentype fonts that contain embedded bitmaps (such as Noto Color Emoji), but by default we strip those tables from webfont resources so they can't be used via `@font-face`, they only work when installed locally.

There's a pref `gfx.downloadable_fonts.keep_color_bitmaps` that controls this, so it's possible for a user to open up the vulnerability, but it's false by default:

<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/61728de8273c04fe2417c475fc0637e8b79210d7/modules/libpref/init/StaticPrefList.yaml#4180-4186>

As such, I think we should be safe from this with default prefs settings.

thanks for the pref tip. Even with that set I can't get a crash in Windows ASAN Nightly with the testcase. With or without the pref flip I do see the following console warnings so maybe the testcase isn't quite right for Firefox?

```

It wouldn't affect Windows, we don't use freetype there -- only on Linux and Android.

Having said that, I don't get a crash on Linux even with the pref toggled. (Opt build; maybe ASAN or valgrind would show something, but I don't have those builds on hand immediately.)

I'll lower this to `sec-moderate` based on the non-default pref being required. We shouldn't have to re-spin Fx82 for this.

Do we have any hints how popular an option `gfx.downloadable_fonts.keep_color_bitmaps` is? I bet fairly popular in some communities (discussion boards that use that kind of font?) but maybe not all that widespread. I only get a couple of Google hits for sites telling people how they can use the pref to enable emojis.

We don't have any actual data afaik, but I doubt it's at all common. There aren't a huge number of such fonts out there besides Noto Color Emoji, which generally comes preinstalled on devices, and is rather big to deploy as a webfont anyhow.

People doing stuff with color webfonts are more often using the outline-based COLR/CPAL format, or sometimes SVG-in-OT, which are unrelated to this issue and don't depend on setting the `keep_color_bitmaps` pref.

So I don't see this justifying a respin or other highly-urgent response. Given that it's a nice simple patch, I think it'd make sense to cherry-pick it for beta/esr releases, though.

> It wouldn't affect Windows, we don't use freetype there -- only on Linux and Android.

Can I clarify that Android is affected due to in-tree freetype2, but Linux is only affected when the installed system library is vulnerable? Maybe I'm missing where the vendored version is used for Linux, too.

Right, I should have added that on Linux, we don't (AFAIK) use in-tree freetype and so the status here would depend on the system library and not on what we do with our vendored copy.

I assume the pref is not exposed to users on fenix (where about:config is nightly only, AIUI).

Normally I'd say don't land on ESR this far before release, but in this case with GPZ publicizing the bug there's no harm done.

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Steve Fink, Jason Kratzer, Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Summary

When using Firefox with Trusted Recursive Resolver (TRR), private IP addresses are

rejected by default (`network.trr.allow-rfc1918=false`). This protection can prevent

browser-based attacks of machines located on the LAN such as DNS-rebinding attacks.

However, this protection can be bypassed by using a IPv4-mapped IPV6 address

(eg. ::ffff:192.168.1.254).

This has been tested with Firefox Nightly 84.0a1 (2020-10-21) (64 bits) on Debian testing.

## Example

Let's create some domain names records:

```
$ dig @1.1.1.1 +short A wat4.urdhr.fr
::ffff:192.168.1.254
$ dig @1.1.1.1 +short AAAA wat6.urdhr.fr
::ffff:192.168.1.254

```

Let's check the are actually resolved by the DoH resolver

we are using:

```
import dns.query
import dns.message
resolver = "https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query"
dns.query.https(dns.message.make_query("wat4.urdhr.fr", "A"), resolver).answer
# => [<DNS wat4.urdhr.fr. IN A RRset: [<192.168.1.254>]>]
dns.query.https(dns.message.make_query("wat6.urdhr.fr", "AAAA"), resolver).answer
# => [<DNS wat6.urdhr.fr. IN AAAA RRset: [<::ffff:192.168.1.254>]>]

```

When using TRR and `network.trr.allow-rfc1918=false`,

* <http://wat4.urdhr.fr> is not reachable in TRR

  mode because the private IP address is rejected by Firefox;
* <http://wat6.urdhr.fr> however, is reachable

  (assuming a web server is running on this IP address and port).

As far as I understand, the process is as follow:

1. the name is resolved to IPv6 ffff:192.168.1.254;
2. this IPv6 address is not considered a private IP address by `NetAddr::IsIPAddrLocal()`;
3. this IPv6 address generates a `AF_INET6` address in `DOHresp::Add()`;
4. this `AF_INET6` is passed to kernel;
5. kernel connects to 192.168.1.256.

## Code snippets

NetAddr derivation from DNS bytes:

```
nsresult DOHresp::Add(uint32_t TTL, unsigned char* dns, unsigned int index,
                      uint16_t len, bool aLocalAllowed) {
  NetAddr addr;
  if (4 == len) {
    // IPv4
    addr.inet.family = AF_INET;
    addr.inet.port = 0;  // unknown
    addr.inet.ip = ntohl(get32bit(dns, index));
  } else if (16 == len) {
    // IPv6
    addr.inet6.family = AF_INET6;
    addr.inet6.port = 0;      // unknown
    addr.inet6.flowinfo = 0;  // unknown
    addr.inet6.scope_id = 0;  // unknown
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++, index++) {
      addr.inet6.ip.u8[i] = dns[index];
    }
  } else {
    return NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED;
  }

  if (addr.IsIPAddrLocal() && !aLocalAllowed) {

    return NS_ERROR_FAILURE;
  }

  // While the DNS packet might return individual TTLs for each address,
  // we can only return one value in the AddrInfo class so pick the
  // lowest number.
  if (mTtl < TTL) {
    mTtl = TTL;
  }

  if (LOG_ENABLED()) {
    char buf[128];
    addr.ToStringBuffer(buf, sizeof(buf));
    LOG(("DOHresp:Add %s\n", buf));
  }
  mAddresses.AppendElement(addr);
  return NS_OK;
}

```

Checking if IP address is private:

```
bool NetAddr::IsIPAddrLocal() const {
  const NetAddr* addr = this;

  // IPv4 RFC1918 and Link Local Addresses.
  if (addr->raw.family == AF_INET) {
    uint32_t addr32 = ntohl(addr->inet.ip);
    if (addr32 >> 24 == 0x0A ||    // 10/8 prefix (RFC 1918).
        addr32 >> 20 == 0xAC1 ||   // 172.16/12 prefix (RFC 1918).
        addr32 >> 16 == 0xC0A8 ||  // 192.168/16 prefix (RFC 1918).
        addr32 >> 16 == 0xA9FE) {  // 169.254/16 prefix (Link Local).
      return true;
    }
  }
  // IPv6 Unique and Link Local Addresses.
  if (addr->raw.family == AF_INET6) {
    uint16_t addr16 = ntohs(addr->inet6.ip.u16[0]);
    if (addr16 >> 9 == 0xfc >> 1 ||    // fc00::/7 Unique Local Address.
        addr16 >> 6 == 0xfe80 >> 6) {  // fe80::/10 Link Local Address.
      return true;
    }
  }
  // Not an IPv4/6 local address.
  return false;
}

```
## Tests

These tests should be able to check the expected behavior (in `test_trr.js`):

```
// verify RFC1918 IPv4-mapped address from the server is rejected
add_task(async function test7() {
  dns.clearCache(true);
  Services.prefs.setIntPref("network.trr.mode", 3); // TRR-only
  Services.prefs.setCharPref(
    "network.trr.uri",
    `https://foo.example.com:${h2Port}/doh?responseIP=::ffff.192.168.0.1`
  );
  let [, , inStatus] = await new DNSListener(
    "rfc1918.example.com",
    undefined,
    false
  );
  Assert.ok(
    !Components.isSuccessCode(inStatus),
    `${inStatus} should be an error code`
  );
});

// verify RFC1918 IPv4-mapped address from the server is fine when told so
add_task(async function test8() {
  dns.clearCache(true);
  Services.prefs.setIntPref("network.trr.mode", 3); // TRR-only
  Services.prefs.setCharPref(
    "network.trr.uri",
    `https://foo.example.com:${h2Port}/doh?responseIP=::ffff.192.168.0.1`
  );
  Services.prefs.setBoolPref("network.trr.allow-rfc1918", true);
  await new DNSListener("rfc1918.example.com", "192.168.0.1");
});

```
## Additional Considerations

It would probably make sense to be able to reject the following networks

as well:

* 0.0.0.0/24
* 127.0.0.0/8
* ::1/128

These can be used for DNS-rebinding attacks on the local machine.

What TRR mode do you use? I'm pretty sure by default we simply bypass DoH for RFC1918 addresses and resolve them locally. It's not a protection, it's because the remote TRR isn't going to know anything about your local network. However, if you've disabled fallback then maybe you get some accidental protection.

We have other proposals to protect against local connections: see "CORS for RFC1918" proposals.

Dragana: is the first bit correct? What is the purpose of the `network.trr.allow-rfc1918` pref

> What TRR mode do you use?

I'm using `network.trr.mode=2`.

> I'm pretty sure by default we simply bypass DoH for RFC1918 addresses

I'm not sure I understand this. I think you are talking about the fact that when I'm visiting <http://192.168.0.1>, DoH won't be used to resolve 192.168.0.1 into an IP address.

This is not what `network.trr.allow-rfc1918` is about.

> What is the purpose of the network.trr.allow-rfc1918 pref

As far as I understand, `network.trr.allow-rfc1918=true` tells that when I'm resolving [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) into an IP address (for example because I'm visiting <http://www.example.com>), Firefox will ignore any private IP address obtained over DoH, i.e. :

1. Firefox want to connect to <http://www.example.com>
2. Firefox tries to resolve [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) using DoH
3. DoH resolver answers with 198.168.0.1
4. address is ignored by Firefox (when `network.trr.allow-rfc1918=true`)

I suppose this feature is implemented as protection against DNS-based attacks. In particular, this block many DNS-rebinding attacks against vulnerable services on the LAN.

Some resolvers have support for blocking private IP addresses [1] this . For example, the resolvers of my ISP implement this feature [2] (I would argue that this practice is questionable). By enabling TRR on Firefox, the local/ISP resolvers are bypassed. So, enabling TRR might end up opening DNS-rebinding attacks

Note: `network.trr.allow-rfc1918` controls `aLocalAllowed` in `DOHresp::Add()` which is called when processing a DoH response.

> We have other proposals to protect against local connections: see "CORS for RFC1918" proposals.

Good to know. I was not aware of this! I'll look at this.

This is a good catch. Thanks for the report.

Normally these shouldn't be a problem - the loaded page can always try to access [http://127.0.0.1:[port]](http://127.0.0.1:%5Bport%5D) regardless of the domain. We might add a pref for these anyways, but I don't think we need to change the default unless you can think of a way to exploit this.

> the loaded page can always try to access [http://127.0.0.1:[port]](http://127.0.0.1:%5Bport%5D) regardless of the domain.

Yes but the same thing can be said of [http://192.168.0.1:[port]](http://192.168.0.1:%5Bport%5D).

For both cases (private and localhost IP address) , the problem (in the case of DNS-rebinding attacks) is that these endpoints are accessed while being considered an other origin (eg. [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)).

> unless you can think of a way to exploit this.

DNS-rebinding attacks can be conducted against 127.0.0.1 (or 0.0.0.0, ::1) juste as well:

1. user visits <http://www.example.com:1234>
2. Browser looks up [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) and gets 10.0.0.1
3. Browse connects to 10.0.0.1:1234 and receives malicious JavaScript code
4. Malicious JS code calls `fetch("/some_resource")`
5. Browser looks up [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) again and gets 127.0.0.1
6. Browser makes GET `http://www.example.com:1234/some_resource` against 127.0.0.1:1234
7. Browser sees the request as being same-origin and exposes response to JS code
8. Browser exfiltrates response to other.example.com

While this example is about a `GET`, we could make other kind of requests as well.

For reference, I found this after reading an [advisory](https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2020-003/-fritz-box-dns-rebinding-protection-bypass) about [CVE-2020-26887](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-26887).

Woops, in steps (2) and (3), the IP address was meant to be [an example one](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737) (eg. 192.0.2.1).

Do you think we should do something when a resolver returns one of these IPs?

I think right now we don't have any specific handling for 0.0.0.0, even though it could be used to connect to localhost.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Unclear how easy it would be to actually exploit this.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: Yes
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: all
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: No
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: Easy to port to esr78
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Low risk of regressions. This patch ensures that we apply the same checks to IPv4 mapped IPv6 addresses.

It would probably make sense to consider all these IP as "private".

See a [related ticket](https://github.com/WICG/cors-rfc1918/issues/24) I opened about cors-rfc1918.

This; and the test, are okay to land and request uplift. Reproducing the issue is trivial from the patch, so there is no need to delay the test and incur the cognitive overhead of remembering to land it later.

I think we ought to try in a separate mechanism that's easy to revert (e.g., with a pref). There's a risk this will break stuff for our users when we block things resolving to localhost. I'm not too concerned about 0.0.0.0 though.

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 83

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

##### References

* [Bug 1667113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113)

#### [#CVE-2020-26952: Out of memory handling of JITed, inlined functions could lead to a memory corruption](#CVE-2020-26952)

Reporter
Gary Kwong
Impact
high
##### Description

Incorrect bookkeeping of functions inlined during JIT compilation could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash when handling out-of-memory errors.

##### References

* [Bug 1667685](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667685)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1642028](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1642028)

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

##### References

* [Bug 1656741](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741)

#### [#CVE-2020-26954: Local spoofing of web manifests for arbitrary pages in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26954)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When accepting a malicious intent from other installed apps, Firefox for Android accepted manifests from arbitrary file paths and allowed declaring webapp manifests for other origins. This could be used to gain fullscreen access for UI spoofing and could also lead to cross-origin attacks on targeted websites.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1657026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1657026)

#### [#CVE-2020-26955: Cookies set during file downloads are shared between normal and Private Browsing Mode in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26955)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a user downloaded a file in Firefox for Android, if a cookie is set, it would have been re-sent during a subsequent file download operation on the same domain, regardless of whether the original and subsequent request were in private and non-private browsing modes.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1663261](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663261)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

##### References

* [Bug 1666300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300)

#### [#CVE-2020-26957: OneCRL was not working in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26957)

Reporter
Kevin Brosnan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

OneCRL was non-functional in the new Firefox for Android due to a missing service initialization. This could result in a failure to enforce some certificate revocations.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1667179](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667179)

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1669466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

##### References

* [Bug 1672223](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672223)

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

##### References

* [Bug 1672528](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672528)

#### [#CVE-2020-26962: Cross-origin iframes supported login autofill](#CVE-2020-26962)

Reporter
Paul Stone
Impact
low
##### Description

Cross-origin iframes that contained a login form could have been recognized by the login autofill service, and populated. This could have been used in clickjacking attacks, as well as be read across partitions in dynamic first party isolation.

##### References

* [Bug 610997](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=610997)

#### [#CVE-2020-26963: History and Location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser](#CVE-2020-26963)

Reporter
Sachin Raste
Impact
low
##### Description

Repeated calls to the history and location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser. This was addressed by introducing rate-limiting to these API calls.

##### References

* [Bug 1314912](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1314912)

#### [#CVE-2020-26964: Firefox for Android's Remote Debugging via USB could have been abused by untrusted apps on older versions of Android](#CVE-2020-26964)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
low
##### Description

If the Remote Debugging via USB feature was enabled in Firefox for Android on an Android version prior to Android 6.0, untrusted apps could have connected to the feature and operated with the privileges of the browser to read and interact with web content. The feature was implemented as a unix domain socket, protected by the Android SELinux policy; however, SELinux was not enforced for versions prior to 6.0. This was fixed by removing the Remote Debugging via USB feature from affected devices.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1658865](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1658865)

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

##### References

* [Bug 1661617](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661617)

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1663571](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571)

#### [#CVE-2020-26967: Mutation Observers could break or confuse Firefox Screenshots feature](#CVE-2020-26967)

Reporter
Kaizer Soze
Impact
low
##### Description

When listening for page changes with a Mutation Observer, a malicious web page could confuse Firefox Screenshots into interacting with elements other than those that it injected into the page. This would lead to internal errors and unexpected behavior in the Screenshots code.

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Byron Campen, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
