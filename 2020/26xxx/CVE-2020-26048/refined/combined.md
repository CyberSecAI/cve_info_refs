## Description

![@Debaibi](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36981576?u=b91a043a2de6af7def70c4391e578d3007fb5832&v=4&size=48)[Debaibi](https://github.com/Debaibi)opened [on Nov 1, 2019](https://github.com/CuppaCMS/CuppaCMS/issues/7#issue-516250138)

Affected software: CuppaCMS

Type of vulnerability: Remote code execution

Discovered by: Yosri Debaibi

## Description:

The file manager option allows admin users to upload images to the application, the rename function could be altered by the users, An authenticated attacker is able to upload a malicious file within an image extension (jpg,jpeg,png ..) and through a custom request using the rename function provided by the file manager is able to modify the image extension into php as a result executing php codes .

## Proof of concept:

## Step1: Login to the cuppa cms.

## Step2:URL:<http://127.0.0.1/cuppa/administrator/>

Go to the File manager.

## Step3: Upload our malicious php file with image extension in Upload\_files.

[![im](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36981576/68043637-03e43880-fcd6-11e9-8fdd-ecbf6258e9f6.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36981576/68043637-03e43880-fcd6-11e9-8fdd-ecbf6258e9f6.png)

Once it is uploaded the file is renamed with "evil\_1572625596.jpg" which it is located in media/upload\_files/evil\_1572625596.jpg

as shown in the figure below

## Step4: We launched our proxy to intercept the request then we will rename our file to evil.php using rename button in the file manager.

## Step5: We deleted the jpg extension from "to:/upload\_files/evil.php.jpg" parameter to change our file name to evil.php and forward the request to the server.

[![Screenshot from 2019-11-01 17-36-24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36981576/68042512-5cfe9d00-fcd3-11e9-9bc4-0f233bd62ae3.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36981576/68042512-5cfe9d00-fcd3-11e9-9bc4-0f233bd62ae3.png)

## Step6: We had successfully uploaded our evil.php in the server.

[![Screenshot from 2019-11-01 17-38-05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36981576/68040406-8e289e80-fcce-11e9-8518-bcb3f17931bb.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36981576/68040406-8e289e80-fcce-11e9-8518-bcb3f17931bb.png)

we executed our payload by accessing the url below

<http://127.0.0.1/cuppa/administrator/media/upload_files/evil.php>

PHP code is executed.
