{
  "CVE-2020-26556": {
    "Root cause": "The authentication protocol in Bluetooth Mesh Profile provisioning is vulnerable if the AuthValue can be identified during the provisioning procedure, even if the AuthValue is selected randomly.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Malleable Commitment: An attacker can manipulate the authentication process by identifying the AuthValue before the provisioning procedure times out."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can obtain a NetKey, which could be used to decrypt and authenticate up to the network layer, allowing the relay of messages, but no application data decryption. An attacker with a NetKey can perform any operation permitted to a node provisioned on the subnet until it is either denied access or a new subnet is formed without the attacking node present.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "An attacker needs to be within wireless range of a Mesh Provisioner.",
       "The attacker needs to observe the provisioning process, and then attempt to brute force the AuthValue by analyzing the provisioning random and provisioning confirmation values."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to be within wireless range, be able to observe or take part in the provisioning, and have sufficient computational resources to attempt to brute-force the AuthValue before the provisioning times out."
