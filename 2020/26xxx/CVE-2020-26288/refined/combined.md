# LDAP auth stores password in plain text

Low

[davimacedo](/davimacedo)
published
GHSA-4w46-w44m-3jq3
Dec 2, 2020

## Package

npm

parse-server
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<=4.4.0

## Patched versions

>= 4.5.0

## Description

I managed to configure LDAP as auth method and managed to “create” a user with a POST request to the users endpoint: the server responded as reported in the documentation.

I noticed though that a subsequent request to the same endpoint returns a contract similar to the endpoint users/me with the sessionToken header.

The thing that I find disturbing is that the returned contract contains an authData section with my domain password in plain text, which also means that the password is stored as plain text in the database, confirmed by exploring the \_User collection.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-26288

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server works with the Express web application framework. It can be added to existing web applications, or run by itself.

The full documentation for Parse Server is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/wiki). The [Parse Server guide](http://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/) is a good place to get started. An [API reference](http://parseplatform.org/parse-server/api/) and [Cloud Code guide](https://docs.parseplatform.org/cloudcode/guide/) are also available. If you're interested in developing for Parse Server, the [Development guide](http://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#development-guide) will help you get set up.

# Flavors & Branches

Parse Server is available in different flavors on different branches:

* The main branches are [release](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/blob/release/changelogs/CHANGELOG_release.md), [beta](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/blob/beta/changelogs/CHANGELOG_beta.md) and [alpha](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/blob/alpha/changelogs/CHANGELOG_alpha.md). See the [changelog overview](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md) for details.
* The long-term-support (LTS) branches are named `release-<version>.x.x`, for example `release-5.x.x`. LTS branches do not have pre-release branches.

## Long Term Support

Long-Term-Support (LTS) is provided for the previous Parse Server major version. For example, Parse Server 5.x will receive security updates until Parse Server 6.x is superseded by Parse Server 7.x and becomes the new LTS version. While the current major version is published on branch `release`, a LTS version is published on branch `release-#.x.x`, for example `release-5.x.x` for the Parse Server 5.x LTS branch.

â ï¸ LTS versions are provided to help you transition as soon as possible to the current major version. While we aim to fix security vulnerabilities in the LTS version, our main focus is on developing the current major version and preparing the next major release. Therefore we may leave certain vulnerabilities up to the community to fix. Search for [pull requests with the specific LTS base branch](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+base%3Arelease-5.x.x) to see the current open vulnerabilities for that LTS branch.

# Getting Started

The fastest and easiest way to get started is to run MongoDB and Parse Server locally.

## Running Parse Server

Before you start make sure you have installed:

* [NodeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/) that includes `npm`
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)(with [PostGIS](https://postgis.net) 2.2.0 or higher)
* Optionally [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Compatibility

#### Node.js

Parse Server is continuously tested with the most recent releases of Node.js to ensure compatibility. We follow the [Node.js Long Term Support plan](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) and only test against versions that are officially supported and have not reached their end-of-life date.

| Version | Latest Version | End-of-Life | Compatible |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js 18 | 18.20.4 | April 2025 | â Yes |
| Node.js 20 | 20.15.1 | April 2026 | â Yes |
| Node.js 22 | 22.4.1 | April 2027 | â Yes |

#### MongoDB

Parse Server is continuously tested with the most recent releases of MongoDB to ensure compatibility. We follow the [MongoDB support schedule](https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy) and [MongoDB lifecycle schedule](https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy/lifecycles) and only test against versions that are officially supported and have not reached their end-of-life date. MongoDB "rapid releases" are ignored as these are considered pre-releases of the next major version.

| Version | Latest Version | End-of-Life | Compatible |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MongoDB 4.2 | 4.2.25 | April 2023 | â Yes |
| MongoDB 4.4 | 4.4.29 | February 2024 | â Yes |
| MongoDB 5 | 5.0.26 | October 2024 | â Yes |
| MongoDB 6 | 6.0.14 | July 2025 | â Yes |
| MongoDB 7 | 7.0.8 | TDB | â Yes |
| MongoDB 8 | 8.0.0 | TDB | â Yes |

#### PostgreSQL

Parse Server is continuously tested with the most recent releases of PostgreSQL and PostGIS to ensure compatibility, using [PostGIS docker images](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/postgis/postgis/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated). We follow the [PostgreSQL support schedule](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning) and [PostGIS support schedule](https://www.postgis.net/eol_policy/) and only test against versions that are officially supported and have not reached their end-of-life date. Due to the extensive PostgreSQL support duration of 5 years, Parse Server drops support about 2 years before the official end-of-life date.

| Version | PostGIS Version | End-of-Life | Parse Server Support | Compatible |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Postgres 13 | 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 | November 2025 | <= 6.x (2023) | â Yes |
| Postgres 14 | 3.5 | November 2026 | <= 7.x (2024) | â Yes |
| Postgres 15 | 3.5 | November 2027 | <= 8.x (2025) | â Yes |
| Postgres 16 | 3.5 | November 2028 | <= 9.x (2026) | â Yes |
| Postgres 17 | 3.5 | November 2029 | <= 9.x (2026) | â Yes |

### Locally

```
$ npm install -g parse-server mongodb-runner
$ mongodb-runner start
$ parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY --databaseURI mongodb://localhost/test
```

***Note:*** *If installation with* `-g` *fails due to permission problems* (`npm ERR! code 'EACCES'`), *please refer to [this link](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).*

### Docker Container

```
$ git clone https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server
$ cd parse-server
$ docker build --tag parse-server .
$ docker run --name my-mongo -d mongo
```

#### Running the Parse Server Image

```
$ docker run --name my-parse-server -v config-vol:/parse-server/config -p 1337:1337 --link my-mongo:mongo -d parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY --databaseURI mongodb://mongo/test
```

***Note:*** *If you want to use [Cloud Code](https://docs.parseplatform.org/cloudcode/guide/), add `-v cloud-code-vol:/parse-server/cloud --cloud /parse-server/cloud/main.js` to the command above. Make sure `main.js` is in the `cloud-code-vol` directory before starting Parse Server.*

You can use any arbitrary string as your application id and master key. These will be used by your clients to authenticate with the Parse Server.

That's it! You are now running a standalone version of Parse Server on your machine.

**Using a remote MongoDB?** Pass the `--databaseURI DATABASE_URI` parameter when starting `parse-server`. Learn more about configuring Parse Server [here](#configuration). For a full list of available options, run `parse-server --help`.

### Saving an Object

Now that you're running Parse Server, it is time to save your first object. We'll use the [REST API](http://docs.parseplatform.org/rest/guide), but you can easily do the same using any of the [Parse SDKs](http://parseplatform.org/#sdks). Run the following:

```
$ curl -X POST \
-H "X-Parse-Application-Id: APPLICATION_ID" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"score":1337,"playerName":"Sean Plott","cheatMode":false}' \
http://localhost:1337/parse/classes/GameScore
```

You should get a response similar to this:

```
{
  "objectId": "2ntvSpRGIK",
  "createdAt": "2016-03-11T23:51:48.050Z"
}
```

You can now retrieve this object directly (make sure to replace `2ntvSpRGIK` with the actual `objectId` you received when the object was created):

```
$ curl -X GET \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: APPLICATION_ID" \
  http://localhost:1337/parse/classes/GameScore/2ntvSpRGIK
```

```
// Response
{
  "objectId": "2ntvSpRGIK",
  "score": 1337,
  "playerName": "Sean Plott",
  "cheatMode": false,
  "updatedAt": "2016-03-11T23:51:48.050Z",
  "createdAt": "2016-03-11T23:51:48.050Z"
}
```

Keeping tracks of individual object ids is not ideal, however. In most cases you will want to run a query over the collection, like so:

```
$ curl -X GET \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: APPLICATION_ID" \
  http://localhost:1337/parse/classes/GameScore
```

```
// The response will provide all the matching objects within the `results` array:
{
  "results": [
    {
      "objectId": "2ntvSpRGIK",
      "score": 1337,
      "playerName": "Sean Plott",
      "cheatMode": false,
      "updatedAt": "2016-03-11T23:51:48.050Z",
      "createdAt": "2016-03-11T23:51:48.050Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

To learn more about using saving and querying objects on Parse Server, check out the [Parse documentation](http://docs.parseplatform.org).

### Connect an SDK

Parse provides SDKs for all the major platforms. Refer to the Parse Server guide to [learn how to connect your app to Parse Server](https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#using-parse-sdks-with-parse-server).

You can also create an instance of Parse Server, and mount it on a new or existing Express website:

```
const express = require('express');
const ParseServer = require('parse-server').ParseServer;
const app = express();

const server = new ParseServer({
  databaseURI: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/dev', // Connection string for your MongoDB database
  cloud: './cloud/main.js', // Path to your Cloud Code
  appId: 'myAppId',
  masterKey: 'myMasterKey', // Keep this key secret!
  fileKey: 'optionalFileKey',
  serverURL: 'http://localhost:1337/parse' // Don't forget to change to https if needed
});

// Start server
await server.start();

// Serve the Parse API on the /parse URL prefix
app.use('/parse', server.app);

app.listen(1337, function() {
  console.log('parse-server-example running on port 1337.');
});
```

For a full list of available options, run `parse-server --help` or take a look at [Parse Server Configurations][server-options].

## Parse Server Health

Check the Parse Server health by sending a request to the `/parse/health` endpoint.

The response looks like this:

```
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

### Status Values

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `initialized` | The server has been created but the `start` method has not been called yet. |
| `starting` | The server is starting up. |
| `ok` | The server started and is running. |
| `error` | There was a startup error, see the logs for details. |

# Configuration

Parse Server can be configured using the following options. You may pass these as parameters when running a standalone `parse-server`, or by loading a configuration file in JSON format using `parse-server path/to/configuration.json`. If you're using Parse Server on Express, you may also pass these to the `ParseServer` object as options.

For the full list of available options, run `parse-server --help` or take a look at [Parse Server Configurations][server-options].

## Basic Options

* `appId` **(required)** - The application id to host with this server instance. You can use any arbitrary string. For migrated apps, this should match your hosted Parse app.
* `masterKey` **(required)** - The master key to use for overriding ACL security. You can use any arbitrary string. Keep it secret! For migrated apps, this should match your hosted Parse app.
* `databaseURI` **(required)** - The connection string for your database, i.e. `mongodb://user:pass@host.com/dbname`. Be sure to [URL encode your password](https://app.zencoder.com/docs/guides/getting-started/special-characters-in-usernames-and-passwords) if your password has special characters.
* `port` - The default port is 1337, specify this parameter to use a different port.
* `serverURL` - URL to your Parse Server (don't forget to specify http:// or https://). This URL will be used when making requests to Parse Server from Cloud Code.
* `cloud` - The absolute path to your cloud code `main.js` file.
* `push` - Configuration options for APNS and GCM push. See the [Push Notifications quick start](https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#push-notifications-quick-start).

## Client Key Options

The client keys used with Parse are no longer necessary with Parse Server. If you wish to still require them, perhaps to be able to refuse access to older clients, you can set the keys at initialization time. Setting any of these keys will require all requests to provide one of the configured keys.

* `clientKey`
* `javascriptKey`
* `restAPIKey`
* `dotNetKey`

## Access Scopes

| Scope | Internal data | Read-only data (1) | Custom data | Restricted by CLP, ACL | Key |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internal | r/w | r/w | r/w | no | `maintenanceKey` |
| Master | -/- | r/- | r/w | no | `masterKey` |
| ReadOnlyMaster | -/- | r/- | r/- | no | `readOnlyMasterKey` |
| Session | -/- | r/- | r/w | yes | `sessionToken` |

(1) `Parse.Object.createdAt`, `Parse.Object.updatedAt`.

## Email Verification and Password Reset

Verifying user email addresses and enabling password reset via email requires an email adapter. There are many email adapters provided and maintained by the community. The following is an example configuration with an example email adapter. See the [Parse Server Options][server-options] for more details and a full list of available options.

```
const server = ParseServer({
  ...otherOptions,

  // Enable email verification
  verifyUserEmails: true,

  // Set email verification token validity to 2 hours
  emailVerifyTokenValidityDuration: 2 * 60 * 60,

  // Set email adapter
  emailAdapter: {
    module: 'example-mail-adapter',
    options: {
      // Additional adapter options
      ...mailAdapterOptions
    }
  },
});
```

Offical email adapters maintained by Parse Platform:

* [parse-server-api-mail-adapter](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server-api-mail-adapter) (localization, templates, universally supports any email provider)

* [simple-parse-smtp-adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-parse-smtp-adapter)
* [parse-server-generic-email-adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-server-generic-email-adapter)

## Password and Account Policy

Set a password and account policy that meets your security requirements. The following is an example configuration. See the [Parse Server Options][server-options] for more details and a full list of available options.

```
const server = ParseServer({
  ...otherOptions,

  // The account lock policy
  accountLockout: {
    // Lock the account for 5 minutes.
    duration: 5,
    // Lock an account after 3 failed log-in attempts
    threshold: 3,
    // Unlock the account after a successful password reset
    unlockOnPasswordReset: true,
  },

  // The password policy
  passwordPolicy: {
    // Enforce a password of at least 8 characters which contain at least 1 lower case, 1 upper case and 1 digit
    validatorPattern: /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9])(?=.{8,})/,
    // Do not allow the username as part of the password
    doNotAllowUsername: true,
    // Do not allow to re-use the last 5 passwords when setting a new password
    maxPasswordHistory: 5,
  },
});
```

## Custom Routes

**Caution, this is an experimental feature that may not be appropriate for production.**

Custom routes allow to build user flows with webpages, similar to the existing password reset and email verification features. Custom routes are defined with the `pages` option in the Parse Server configuration:

### Example

```
const api = new ParseServer({
  ...otherOptions,

  pages: {
    enableRouter: true, // Enables the experimental feature; required for custom routes
    customRoutes: [{
      method: 'GET',
      path: 'custom_route',
      handler: async request => {
        // custom logic
        // ...
        // then, depending on the outcome, return a HTML file as response
        return { file: 'custom_page.html' };
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

The above route can be invoked by sending a `GET` request to:
`https://[parseServerPublicUrl]/[parseMount]/[pagesEndpoint]/[appId]/[customRoute]`

The `handler` receives the `request` and returns a `custom_page.html` webpage from the `pages.pagesPath` directory as response. The advantage of building a custom route this way is that it automatically makes use of Parse Server's built-in capabilities, such as [page localization](#pages) and [dynamic placeholders](#dynamic-placeholders).

### Reserved Paths

The following paths are already used by Parse Server's built-in features and are therefore not available for custom routes. Custom routes with an identical combination of `path` and `method` are ignored.

| Path | HTTP Method | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `verify_email` | `GET` | email verification |
| `resend_verification_email` | `POST` | email verification |
| `choose_password` | `GET` | password reset |
| `request_password_reset` | `GET` | password reset |
| `request_password_reset` | `POST` | password reset |

### Parameters

| Parameter | Optional | Type | Default value | Example values | Environment variable | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pages` | yes | `Object` | `undefined` | - | `PARSE_SERVER_PAGES` | The options for pages such as password reset and email verification. |
| `pages.enableRouter` | yes | `Boolean` | `false` | - | `PARSE_SERVER_PAGES_ENABLE_ROUTER` | Is `true` if the pages router should be enabled; this is required for any of the pages options to take effect. **Caution, this is an experimental feature that may not be appropriate for production.** |
| `pages.customRoutes` | yes | `Array` | `[]` | - | `PARSE_SERVER_PAGES_CUSTOM_ROUTES` | The custom routes. The routes are added in the order they are defined here, which has to be considered since requests traverse routes in an ordered manner. Custom routes are traversed after build-in routes such as password reset and email verification. |
| `pages.customRoutes.method` |  | `String` | - | `GET`, `POST` | - | The HTTP method of the custom route. |
| `pages.customRoutes.path` |  | `String` | - | `custom_page` | - | The path of the custom route. Note that the same path can used if the `method` is different, for example a path `custom_page` can have two routes, a `GET` and `POST` route, which will be invoked depending on the HTTP request method. |
| `pages.customRoutes.handler` |  | `AsyncFunction` | - | `async () => { ... }` | - | The route handler that is invoked when the route matches the HTTP request. If the handler does not return a page, the request is answered with a 404 `Not found.` response. |

## Custom Pages

Itâs possible to change the default pages of the app and redirect the user to another path or domain.

```
const server = ParseServer({
  ...otherOptions,

  customPages: {
    passwordResetSuccess: "http://yourapp.com/passwordResetSuccess",
    verifyEmailSuccess: "http://yourapp.com/verifyEmailSuccess",
    parseFrameURL: "http://yourapp.com/parseFrameURL",
    linkSendSuccess: "http://yourapp.com/linkSendSuccess",
    linkSendFail: "http://yourapp.com/linkSendFail",
    invalidLink: "http://yourapp.com/invalidLink",
    invalidVerificationLink: "http://yourapp.com/invalidVerificationLink",
    choosePassword: "http://yourapp.com/choosePassword"
  }
})
```

## Using Environment Variables

You may configure the Parse Server using environment variables:

```
PORT
PARSE_SERVER_APPLICATION_ID
PARSE_SERVER_MASTER_KEY
PARSE_SERVER_DATABASE_URI
PARSE_SERVER_URL
PARSE_SERVER_CLOUD
```

The default port is 1337, to use a different port set the PORT environment variable:

```
$ PORT=8080 parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY
```

For the full list of configurable environment variables, run `parse-server --help` or take a look at [Parse Server Configuration](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/blob/master/src/Options/Definitions.js).

## Available Adapters

All official adapters are distributed as scoped packages on [npm (@parse)](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=scope%3Aparse).

Some well maintained adapters are also available on the [Parse Server Modules](https://github.com/parse-server-modules) organization.

You can also find more adapters maintained by the community by searching on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=parse-server%20adapter&page=1&ranking=optimal).

## Configuring File Adapters

Parse Server allows developers to choose from several options when hosting files:

* `GridFSBucketAdapter` - which is backed by MongoDB
* `S3Adapter` - which is backed by [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
* `GCSAdapter` - which is backed by [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/)
* `FSAdapter` - local file storage

`GridFSBucketAdapter` is used by default and requires no setup, but if you're interested in using Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or local file storage, additional configuration information is available in the [Parse Server guide](http://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#configuring-file-adapters).

## Idempotency Enforcement

**Caution, this is an experimental feature that may not be appropriate for production.**

This feature deduplicates identical requests that are received by Parse Server multiple times, typically due to network issues or network adapter access restrictions on mobile operating systems.

Identical requests are identified by their request header `X-Parse-Request-Id`. Therefore a client request has to include this header for deduplication to be applied. Requests that do not contain this header cannot be deduplicated and are processed normally by Parse Server. This means rolling out this feature to clients is seamless as Parse Server still processes requests without this header when this feature is enabled.

> This feature needs to be enabled on the client side to send the header and on the server to process the header. Refer to the specific Parse SDK docs to see whether the feature is supported yet.

Deduplication is only done for object creation and update (`POST` and `PUT` requests). Deduplication is not done for object finding and deletion (`GET` and `DELETE` requests), as these operations are already idempotent by definition.

### Configuration example

```
let api = new ParseServer({
    idempotencyOptions: {
        paths: [".*"],       // enforce for all requests
        ttl: 120             // keep request IDs for 120s
    }
}

```
### Parameters

| Parameter | Optional | Type | Default value | Example values | Environment variable | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `idempotencyOptions` | yes | `Object` | `undefined` |  | PARSE\_SERVER\_EXPERIMENTAL\_IDEMPOTENCY\_OPTIONS | Setting this enables idempotency enforcement for the specified paths. |
| `idempotencyOptions.paths` | yes | `Array<String>` | `[]` | `.*` (all paths, includes the examples below), `functions/.*` (all functions), `jobs/.*` (all jobs), `classes/.*` (all classes), `functions/.*` (all functions), `users` (user creation / update), `installations` (installation creation / update) | PARSE\_SERVER\_EXPERIMENTAL\_IDEMPOTENCY\_PATHS | An array of path patterns that have to match the request path for request deduplication to be enabled. The mount path must not be included, for example to match the request path `/parse/functions/myFunction` specify the path pattern `functions/myFunction`. A trailing slash of the request path is ignored, for example the path pattern `functions/myFunction` matches both `/parse/functions/myFunction` and `/parse/functions/myFunction/`. |
| `idempotencyOptions.ttl` | yes | `Integer` | `300` | `60` (60 seconds) | PARSE\_SERVER\_EXPERIMENTAL\_IDEMPOTENCY\_TTL | The duration in seconds after which a request record is discarded from the database. Duplicate requests due to network issues can be expected to arrive within milliseconds up to several seconds. This value must be greater than `0`. |

### Postgres

To use this feature in Postgres, you will need to create a cron job using [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/development/pgagent_jobs.html) or similar to call the Postgres function `idempotency_delete_expired_records()` that deletes expired idempotency records. You can find an example script below. Make sure the script has the same privileges to log into Postgres as Parse Server.

```
#!/bin/bash

set -e
psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 --username "$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname "$POSTGRES_DB" <<-EOSQL
    SELECT idempotency_delete_expired_records();
EOSQL

exec "$@"
```

Assuming the script above is named, `parse_idempotency_delete_expired_records.sh`, a cron job that runs the script every 2 minutes may look like:

```
2 * * * * /root/parse_idempotency_delete_expired_records.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
```

## Localization

### Pages

**Caution, this is an experimental feature that may not be appropriate for production.**

Custom pages as well as feature pages (e.g. password reset, email verification) can be localized with the `pages` option in the Parse Server configuration:

```
const api = new ParseServer({
  ...otherOptions,

  pages: {
    enableRouter: true, // Enables the experimental feature; required for localization
    enableLocalization: true,
  }
}
```

Localization is achieved by matching a request-supplied `locale` parameter with localized page content. The locale can be supplied in either the request query, body or header with the following keys:

* query: `locale`
* body: `locale`
* header: `x-parse-page-param-locale`

For example, a password reset link with the locale parameter in the query could look like this:

```
http://example.com/parse/apps/[appId]/request_password_reset?token=[token]&username=[username]&locale=de-AT

```

* Localization is only available for pages in the pages directory as set with `pages.pagesPath`.
* Localization for feature pages (e.g. password reset, email verification) is disabled if `pages.customUrls` are set, even if the custom URLs point to the pages within the pages path.
* Only `.html` files are considered for localization when localizing custom pages.

Pages can be localized in two ways:

#### Localization with Directory Structure

Pages are localized by using the corresponding file in the directory structure where the files are placed in subdirectories named after the locale or language. The file in the base directory is the default file.

**Example Directory Structure:**

```
root/
âââ public/                  // pages base path
â   âââ example.html         // default file
â   âââ de/                  // de language folder
â   â   âââ example.html     // de localized file
â   âââ de-AT/               // de-AT locale folder
â   â   âââ example.html     // de-AT localized file
```

Files are matched with the locale in the following order:

1. Locale match, e.g. locale `de-AT` matches file in folder `de-AT`.
2. Language match, e.g. locale `de-CH` matches file in folder `de`.
3. Default; file in base folder is returned.

**Configuration Example:**

```
const api = new ParseServer({
  ...otherOptions,

  pages: {
    enableRouter: true, // Enables the experimental feature; required for localization
    enableLocalization: true,
    customUrls: {
      passwordReset: 'https://example.com/page.html'
    }
  }
}
```

Pros:

* All files are complete in their content and can be easily opened and previewed by viewing the file in a browser.

Cons:

* In most cases, a localized page differs only slightly from the default page, which could cause a lot of duplicate code that is difficult to maintain.

#### Localization with JSON Resource

Pages are localized by adding placeholders in the HTML files and providing a JSON resource that contains the translations to fill into the placeholders.

**Example Directory Structure:**

```
root/
âââ public/                  // pages base path
â   âââ example.html         // the page containing placeholders
âââ private/                 // folder outside of public scope
â   âââ translations.json    // JSON resource file
```

The JSON resource file loosely follows the [i18next](https://github.com/i18next/i18next) syntax, which is a syntax that is often supported by translation platforms, making it easy to manage translations, exporting them for use in Parse Server, and even to automate this workflow.

**Example JSON Content:**

```
{
  "en": {               // resource for language `en` (English)
    "translation": {
      "greeting": "Hello!"
    }
  },
  "de": {               // resource for language `de` (German)
    "translation": {
      "greeting": "Hallo!"
    }
  }
  "de-AT": {            // resource for locale `de-AT` (Austrian German)
    "translation": {
      "greeting": "Servus!"
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Example:**

```
const api = new ParseServer({
  ...otherOptions,

  pages: {
    enableRouter: true, // Enables the experimental feature; required for localization
    enableLocalization: true,
    localizationJsonPath: './private/localization.json',
    localizationFallbackLocale: 'en'
  }
}
```

Pros:

* There is only one HTML file to maintain that contains the placeholders that are filled with the translations according to the locale.

Cons:

* Files cannot be easily previewed by viewing the file in a browser because the content contains only placeholders and even HTML or CSS changes may be dynamically applied, e.g. when a localization requires a Right-To-Left layout direction.
* Style and other fundamental layout changes may be more difficult to apply.

#### Dynamic placeholders

In addition to feature related default parameters such as `appId` and the translations provided via JSON resource, it is possible to define custom dynamic placeholders as part of the router configuration. This works independently of localization and, also if `enableLocalization` is disabled.

**Configuration Example:**

```
const api = new ParseServer({
  ...otherOptions,

  pages: {
    enableRouter: true, // Enables the experimental feature; required for localization
    placeholders: {
      exampleKey: 'exampleValue'
    }
  }
}
```

The placeholders can also be provided as function or as async function, with the `locale` and other feature related parameters passed through, to allow for dynamic placeholder values:

```
const api = new ParseServer({
  ...otherOptions,

  pages: {
    enableRouter: true, // Enables the experimental feature; required for localization
    placeholders: async (params) => {
      const value = await doSomething(params.locale);
      return {
        exampleKey: value
      };
    }
  }
}
```

#### Reserved Keys

The following parameter and placeholder keys are reserved because they are used related to features such as password reset or email verification. They should not be used as translation keys in the JSON resource or as manually defined placeholder keys in the configuration: `appId`, `appName`, `email`, `error`, `locale`, `publicServerUrl`, `token`, `username`.

### Notes

* In combination with the [Parse Server API Mail Adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-server-api-mail-adapter) Parse Server provides a fully localized flow (emails -> pages) for the user. The email adapter sends a localized email and adds a locale parameter to the password reset or email verification link, which is then used to respond with localized pages.

## Logging

Parse Server will, by default, log:

* to the console
* daily rotating files as new line delimited JSON

Logs are also viewable in Parse Dashboard.

**Want to log each request and response?** Set the `VERBOSE` environment variable when starting `parse-server`. Usage :- `VERBOSE='1' parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY`

# Deprecations

See the [Deprecation Plan](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/blob/master/DEPRECATIONS.md) for an overview of deprecations and planned breaking changes.

# Live Query

Live queries are meant to be used in real-time reactive applications, where just using the traditional query paradigm could cause several problems, like increased response time and high network and server usage. Live queries should be used in cases where you need to continuously update a page with fresh data coming from the database, which often happens in (but is not limited to) online games, messaging clients and shared to-do lists.

Take a look at [Live Query Guide](https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#live-queries), [Live Query Server Setup Guide](https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/#scalability) and [Live Query Protocol Specification](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/wiki/Parse-LiveQuery-Protocol-Specification). You can setup a standalone server or multiple instances for scalability (recommended).

# GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), developed by Facebook, is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs. In addition to the traditional REST API, Parse Server automatically generates a GraphQL API based on your current application schema. Parse Server also allows you to define your custom GraphQL queries and mutations, whose resolvers can be bound to your cloud code functions.

## Running

### Using the CLI

The easiest way to run the Parse GraphQL API is through the CLI:

```
$ npm install -g parse-server mongodb-runner
$ mongodb-runner start
$ parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY --databaseURI mongodb://localhost/test --publicServerURL http://localhost:1337/parse --mountGraphQL --mountPlayground
```

After starting the server, you can visit <http://localhost:1337/playground> in your browser to start playing with your GraphQL API.

***Note:*** Do ***NOT*** use --mountPlayground option in production. [Parse Dashboard](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-dashboard) has a built-in GraphQL Playground and it is the recommended option for production apps.

### Using Docker

You can also run the Parse GraphQL API inside a Docker container:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server
$ cd parse-server
$ docker build --tag parse-server .
$ docker run --name my-mongo -d mongo
```

#### Running the Parse Server Image

```
$ docker run --name my-parse-server --link my-mongo:mongo -v config-vol:/parse-server/config -p 1337:1337 -d parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY --databaseURI mongodb://mongo/test --publicServerURL http://localhost:1337/parse --mountGraphQL --mountPlayground
```

***Note:*** *If you want to use [Cloud Code](https://docs.parseplatform.org/cloudcode/guide/), add `-v cloud-code-vol:/parse-server/cloud --cloud /parse-server/cloud/main.js` to the command above. Make sure `main.js` is in the `cloud-code-vol` directory before starting Parse Server.*

After starting the server, you can visit <http://localhost:1337/playground> in your browser to start playing with your GraphQL API.

***Note:*** Do ***NOT*** use --mountPlayground option in production. [Parse Dashboard](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-dashboard) has a built-in GraphQL Playground and it is the recommended option for production apps.

### Using Express.js

You can also mount the GraphQL API in an Express.js application together with the REST API or solo. You first need to create a new project and install the required dependencies:

```
$ mkdir my-app
$ cd my-app
$ npm install parse-server express --save
```

Then, create an `index.js` file with the following content:

```
const express = require('express');
const { ParseServer, ParseGraphQLServer } = require('parse-server');

const app = express();

const parseServer = new ParseServer({
  databaseURI: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/test',
  appId: 'APPLICATION_ID',
  masterKey: 'MASTER_KEY',
  serverURL: 'http://localhost:1337/parse',
  publicServerURL: 'http://localhost:1337/parse'
});

const parseGraphQLServer = new ParseGraphQLServer(
  parseServer,
  {
    graphQLPath: '/graphql',
    playgroundPath: '/playground'
  }
);

app.use('/parse', parseServer.app); // (Optional) Mounts the REST API
parseGraphQLServer.applyGraphQL(app); // Mounts the GraphQL API
parseGraphQLServer.applyPlayground(app); // (Optional) Mounts the GraphQL Playground - do NOT use in Production

await parseServer.start();
app.listen(1337, function() {
  console.log('REST API running on http://localhost:1337/parse');
  console.log('GraphQL API running on http://localhost:1337/graphql');
  console.log('GraphQL Playground running on http://localhost:1337/playground');
});
```

And finally start your app:

```
$ npx mongodb-runner start
$ node index.js
```

After starting the app, you can visit <http://localhost:1337/playground> in your browser to start playing with your GraphQL API.

***Note:*** Do ***NOT*** mount the GraphQL Playground in production. [Parse Dashboard](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-dashboard) has a built-in GraphQL Playground and it is the recommended option for production apps.

## Checking the API health

Run the following:

```
query Health {
  health
}
```

You should receive the following response:

```
{
  "data": {
    "health": true
  }
}
```

## Creating your first class

Since your application does not have any schema yet, you can use the `createClass` mutation to create your first class. Run the following:

```
mutation CreateClass {
  createClass(
    name: "GameScore"
    schemaFields: {
      addStrings: [{ name: "playerName" }]
      addNumbers: [{ name: "score" }]
      addBooleans: [{ name: "cheatMode" }]
    }
  ) {
    name
    schemaFields {
      name
      __typename
    }
  }
}
```

You should receive the following response:

```
{
  "data": {
    "createClass": {
      "name": "GameScore",
      "schemaFields": [
        {
          "name": "objectId",
          "__typename": "SchemaStringField"
        },
        {
          "name": "updatedAt",
          "__typename": "SchemaDateField"
        },
        {
          "name": "createdAt",
          "__typename": "SchemaDateField"
        },
        {
          "name": "playerName",
          "__typename": "SchemaStringField"
        },
        {
          "name": "score",
          "__typename": "SchemaNumberField"
        },
        {
          "name": "cheatMode",
          "__typename": "SchemaBooleanField"
        },
        {
          "name": "ACL",
          "__typename": "SchemaACLField"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Using automatically generated operations

Parse Server learned from the first class that you created and now you have the `GameScore` class in your schema. You can now start using the automatically generated operations!

Run the following to create your first object:

```
mutation CreateGameScore {
  createGameScore(
    fields: {
      playerName: "Sean Plott"
      score: 1337
      cheatMode: false
    }
  ) {
    id
    updatedAt
    createdAt
    playerName
    score
    cheatMode
    ACL
  }
}
```

You should receive a response similar to this:

```
{
  "data": {
    "createGameScore": {
      "id": "XN75D94OBD",
      "updatedAt": "2019-09-17T06:50:26.357Z",
      "createdAt": "2019-09-17T06:50:26.357Z",
      "playerName": "Sean Plott",
      "score": 1337,
      "cheatMode": false,
      "ACL": null
    }
  }
}
```

You can also run a query to this new class:

```
query GameScores {
  gameScores {
    results {
      id
      updatedAt
      createdAt
      playerName
      score
      cheatMode
      ACL
    }
  }
}
```

You should receive a response similar to this:

```
{
  "data": {
    "gameScores": {
      "results": [
        {
          "id": "XN75D94OBD",
          "updatedAt": "2019-09-17T06:50:26.357Z",
          "createdAt": "2019-09-17T06:50:26.357Z",
          "playerName": "Sean Plott",
          "score": 1337,
          "cheatMode": false,
          "ACL": null
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Customizing your GraphQL Schema

Parse GraphQL Server allows you to create a custom GraphQL schema with own queries and mutations to be merged with the auto-generated ones. You can resolve these operations using your regular cloud code functions.

To start creating your custom schema, you need to code a `schema.graphql` file and initialize Parse Server with `--graphQLSchema` and `--cloud` options:

```
$ parse-server --appId APPLICATION_ID --masterKey MASTER_KEY --databaseURI mongodb://localhost/test --publicServerURL http://localhost:1337/parse --cloud ./cloud/main.js --graphQLSchema ./cloud/schema.graphql --mountGraphQL --mountPlayground
```

### Creating your first custom query

Use the code below for your `schema.graphql` and `main.js` files. Then restart your Parse Server.

```
# schema.graphql
extend type Query {
  hello: String! @resolve
}
```

```
// main.js
Parse.Cloud.define('hello', async () => {
  return 'Hello world!';
});
```

You can now run your custom query using GraphQL Playground:

```
query {
  hello
}
```

You should receive the response below:

```
{
  "data": {
    "hello": "Hello world!"
  }
}
```

## Learning more

The [Parse GraphQL Guide](http://docs.parseplatform.org/graphql/guide/) is a very good source for learning how to use the Parse GraphQL API.

You also have a very powerful tool inside your GraphQL Playground. Please look at the right side of your GraphQL Playground. You will see the `DOCS` and `SCHEMA` menus. They are automatically generated by analyzing your application schema. Please refer to them and learn more about everything that you can do with your Parse GraphQL API.

Additionally, the [GraphQL Learn Section](https://graphql.org/learn/) is a very good source to learn more about the power of the GraphQL language.
