Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-26288:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the LDAP authentication adapter in `parse-server` handled user passwords. When a user was authenticated using LDAP, the system was storing the user's domain password in plain text within the `authData` section of the user record in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plain Text Storage:** Passwords were stored in plain text in the database. This is a critical security vulnerability as it allows anyone with access to the database to view user passwords.
*   **Exposed in API Responses:** The plain text password was also included in the `authData` section of API responses, specifically when requesting user details with session token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Disclosure:**  An attacker gaining access to the database could retrieve all user passwords, leading to complete account takeover.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If domain passwords are reused across systems, an attacker could potentially use the leaked passwords to gain access to other systems.
*   **Data Breach:** Exposure of personal user information associated with the compromised accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Database Access:** An attacker needs access to the database used by the `parse-server` to extract passwords. This could happen through a database compromise.
*   **API Interception:** A less likely but still possible attack vector would be an attacker intercepting API responses, in transit, to gain access to the plain text password in the `authData` section.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Database Access:** The attacker needs either direct access to the MongoDB/PostgreSQL database or the ability to execute queries against it.
*   **API Interception (Less Likely):** The attacker could intercept network traffic to capture API responses, but this is a more complicated attack vector.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was fixed in `parse-server` version 4.5.0 by removing the password from the `authData` section after successful LDAP authentication, ensuring that it is no longer stored in the database or sent in API responses. The fix is in commit `da905a3`.
