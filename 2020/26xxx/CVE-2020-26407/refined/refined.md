{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `ZoomUrlValidator` only checks if the input string *contains* a valid zoom URL instead of validating if the entire string is a valid zoom URL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability arises due to insufficient validation of the Zoom meeting URL during project import. Specifically, the `ZoomUrlValidator` allows a malicious string containing a javascript payload and a valid zoom link to bypass validation. This allows injection of arbitrary javascript code when the user interacts with the 'Join Zoom meeting' link. ",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser by crafting a malicious zoom meeting URL. This could lead to actions being performed on behalf of the user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious user modifying the 'url' attribute within the `project.json` file of an exported project. Upon importing the modified project, the crafted URL is injected and executed when a user interacts with the zoom link. This requires the attacker to export the project, modify it locally and then import the modified project.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to export a project, modify the exported project JSON file, and import the modified project back to the GitLab instance."
