Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2020-50

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 83

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 83

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

##### References

* [Bug 1667113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113)

#### [#CVE-2020-26952: Out of memory handling of JITed, inlined functions could lead to a memory corruption](#CVE-2020-26952)

Reporter
Gary Kwong
Impact
high
##### Description

Incorrect bookkeeping of functions inlined during JIT compilation could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash when handling out-of-memory errors.

##### References

* [Bug 1667685](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667685)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1642028](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1642028)

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

##### References

* [Bug 1656741](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741)

#### [#CVE-2020-26954: Local spoofing of web manifests for arbitrary pages in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26954)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When accepting a malicious intent from other installed apps, Firefox for Android accepted manifests from arbitrary file paths and allowed declaring webapp manifests for other origins. This could be used to gain fullscreen access for UI spoofing and could also lead to cross-origin attacks on targeted websites.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1657026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1657026)

#### [#CVE-2020-26955: Cookies set during file downloads are shared between normal and Private Browsing Mode in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26955)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a user downloaded a file in Firefox for Android, if a cookie is set, it would have been re-sent during a subsequent file download operation on the same domain, regardless of whether the original and subsequent request were in private and non-private browsing modes.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1663261](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663261)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

##### References

* [Bug 1666300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300)

#### [#CVE-2020-26957: OneCRL was not working in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26957)

Reporter
Kevin Brosnan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

OneCRL was non-functional in the new Firefox for Android due to a missing service initialization. This could result in a failure to enforce some certificate revocations.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1667179](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667179)

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1669466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

##### References

* [Bug 1672223](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672223)

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

##### References

* [Bug 1672528](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672528)

#### [#CVE-2020-26962: Cross-origin iframes supported login autofill](#CVE-2020-26962)

Reporter
Paul Stone
Impact
low
##### Description

Cross-origin iframes that contained a login form could have been recognized by the login autofill service, and populated. This could have been used in clickjacking attacks, as well as be read across partitions in dynamic first party isolation.

##### References

* [Bug 610997](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=610997)

#### [#CVE-2020-26963: History and Location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser](#CVE-2020-26963)

Reporter
Sachin Raste
Impact
low
##### Description

Repeated calls to the history and location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser. This was addressed by introducing rate-limiting to these API calls.

##### References

* [Bug 1314912](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1314912)

#### [#CVE-2020-26964: Firefox for Android's Remote Debugging via USB could have been abused by untrusted apps on older versions of Android](#CVE-2020-26964)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
low
##### Description

If the Remote Debugging via USB feature was enabled in Firefox for Android on an Android version prior to Android 6.0, untrusted apps could have connected to the feature and operated with the privileges of the browser to read and interact with web content. The feature was implemented as a unix domain socket, protected by the Android SELinux policy; however, SELinux was not enforced for versions prior to 6.0. This was fixed by removing the Remote Debugging via USB feature from affected devices.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1658865](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1658865)

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Reporter
Kaizer Soze
Impact
low
##### Description

When listening for page changes with a Mutation Observer, a malicious web page could confuse Firefox Screenshots into interacting with elements other than those that it injected into the page. This would lead to internal errors and unexpected behavior in the Screenshots code.

high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Byron Campen, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 78.5

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 78.5

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

##### References

* [Bug 1667113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

##### References

* [Bug 1656741](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

##### References

* [Bug 1666300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300)

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

* [Bug 1672223](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672223)

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Steve Fink, Jason Kratzer, Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

OS/Firefox version:

Works on Firefox 79.0 (64-bit) using Windows 10 Pro

Works on Nightly 81.0a1 (2020-08-01) (64-bit) using Windows 10 Pro

Works on Firefox 79.0 (64-bit) using macOS Catalina Version 10.15.5

Does *not* work on Firefox 79.0 (64-bit) using Ubuntu 18.04.4 desktop

Repro:

1. Host attached PoC HTML in an HTTP server (localhost will do, if other then make sure its HTTPS)
2. Open the hosted 'letsrepro.html' and click the anchor tag

Result:

Firefox enters full screen mode without the security UI saying you are entering fullscreen appearing.

Expected:

When entering full screen mode, the UI indicating so should always appear to prevent security concerns.

See [Bug 1432856](/show_bug.cgi?id=1432856 "VERIFIED FIXED - Popup window can cover fullscreen security UI")

Other info:

For some reason a WebSocket connection attempt has to happen first for this to work

If I remove 'new WebSocket("ws://nonexistent");' from the PoC, it does not work.

I also see the symptom of leaving fullscreen immediately on mac and linux.

I can enter the fullscreen and see the warning by clicking the page again.

If I modified the timeout from 260 to 1260, it works fine.

Besides, I don't see any difference between the file with or without 'new WebSocket("ws://nonexistent");'.

```
-			setTimeout(x=>{location='?go#go';}, 260);
+			setTimeout(x=>{location='?go#go';},1260);

```

Hi reporter,

could you try to extend the second timeout and update the result?

Hello triager,

For me the websocket is needed AFAICT. Every time I remove it I stop reproducing. Applying your changes did not result in repro for MacOS.

On MacOS the original repro stopped working but then I modified two things:

```

			setTimeout(()=>{document.body.requestFullscreen({})},106);
			setTimeout(x=>{location='?gfo#go';},200);//<---- lowered the timeout and changed the URL a bit to prevent cache

```

With the above modifications it started working on MacOS and Windows 10 just fine.

My guess is that once you run it, subsequent runs will ruin the timing due to cache. Will work on a more reliable PoC and update if I get one with 100% on all OS. The WebSocket request is probably just adding to the timing aspect, not sure why it is required for me.

(In reply to Abdulrahman Alqabandi from [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Entering fullscreen without UI message showing"))

> Repro:

In the first trial, I test it on a localhost. (<http://localhost:8000>)

The result is in [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - Entering fullscreen without UI message showing").

If I modified the file based on [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - Entering fullscreen without UI message showing") and [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - Entering fullscreen without UI message showing"), I still saw the same symptom.

The symptom is leaving fullscreen immediately on mac and linux.

* changed the websocket to an existing domain
* lowered the timeout (setTimeout(x=>{location='?gfo#go';},200);)

This time I also tried to use "<https://localhost:4443>" to do the test on mac and linux.

In this setup, after clicking the anchor tag, FF won't enter fullscreen with "new WebSocket("ws://facebook.com")" or "new WebSocket("ws://nonexistent");".

If I removed "new WebSocket(...)", the behavior is leaving fullscreen immediately.

I also tried it on Chome. Chome has the same behavior as FF.

:qab, could you also update the behavior of Chome in your setup?

If possible, could you provide the video which can show the problem on your side?

For me, the problem is still unclear.

1. Is the problem related to "new WebSocket()"?
2. Is the problem related to "change the URL right after entering fullscreen"?

:Gijs, is it possible to ask QA to reproduce the symptom?

We need a solid STR to investigate the problem.

I don't think QA have the skills to adapt the testcase to make it 100% reproducible. If they reproduce and you cannot, what's the point?

In case it makes a difference, I reproduced on Windows by saving the testcase to disk and opening from the file using `file:///`. Of course this means that subsequent requests (on a fast SSD) to the relative `?go#go` link are almost instantaneous.

Without the websocket connection it doesn't reproduce.

> > Is the problem related to "change the URL right after entering fullscreen"?

Without changing the URL, the warning comes up fine. Also, if you change the relative link to only point to `#go`, the warning comes up fine.

Do we check for the URL/document that requested fullscreen and that actually enters fullscreen somewhere?

I wonder if the websocket connection breaks bfcache, and that causes us to create a different windowglobal, and that probably affects the fullscreen actor. Nika, do you know whether websockets break bfcache and whether this is plausible?

Off the top of my head, I think that an active WebSocket connection would disable bfcache, yeah. You can check if this is caused by that change in behaviour by removing the websocket connection, and instead adding an "unload" event listener on the document, which should also suppress bfcache.

Using `window.addEventListener("unload", console.log)` instead of the web socket seems to work, too (ie causes the warning not to come up while the window still goes into fullscreen).

In the console it says "TypeError: Fullscreen request aborted" when the PoC reproduces successfully. Firefox is definitely getting confused due to the navigation.

I was able to come up with a new PoC which seems to be reliable on all platforms (Windows, Linux and MacOS), at least for me.

By the new Poc, I can reproduce the problem.

Actually, the symptom is FF don't leave the fullscreen normally.

At that time, "aActor.requestOrigin" is undefined.

From my experiments, the timing is a big factor.

I can reproduce the problem easily when the timeout is less than 15.

It looks like Alphen was affected by the layoffs. :-(

I looked at this, but the patch that Alphen pushed to try didn't fix the issue for me.

From local logging, it appears the parent process actor gets a `DOMFullscreen:Request` message, and then we unload the document, and the next thing the parent actor hears is that the actor is being destroyed. Then the parent gets a `MozDOMFullscreen:Entered` event.

The warning is normally generated by the `MozDOMFullscreen:NewOrigin` event (forwarded to the parent by the child), which is never seen by either of the bits of frontend code involved (again, based on logging). It looks like it is dispatched asynchronously at <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/19c23d725f27d0989e4a60f36d64004cebb39736/dom/base/Document.cpp#13444-13449> . I *suspect* that it never fires or is never seen by frontend because presumably the original document is destroyed while the event is queued, and/or we decide we don't need to re-emit it when the document to which we navigate is same-origin.

Olli, does this seem like an accurate diagnosis (if you're not the right person, please forward the needinfo to whoever still knows about our fullscreen code...)? I'm pretty confused, because the code in the PoC invokes `document.body.requestFullscreen` and so I'd have expected that the document being unloaded would mean we would interrupt our entering into fullscreen and abort it using the relevant APIs from the child to the parent, given that the element in question is no longer going to be around... :-\

Can you elaborate on what you mean? The only warning I'm aware of is keyed off this event, it seems.

We could change what we use to show the warning, if that would help?

The wip patch isn't necessary quite right for nested iframes.

[Bug 1656741](/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741 "VERIFIED FIXED - Entering fullscreen without UI message showing"), inform parent process about canceled fullscreen request

Or perhaps this should be fixed in a bit different way, since I think, this was working while framescripts were used.

This should be fixed in a difference way. JS actor stuff gets confused here.

Steven has been looking into other fullscreen related issues recently and said he could help here. (thanks!)

<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=9177090> helps with the issue here (testing with <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=9169053>)

but I think there is another problematic case if parent gets "DOMFullscreen:Request" and then didDestroy is called, since at that point

this.\_fullscreenWindow is null, I think, and also window.document.documentElement.hasAttribute("inDOMFullscreen") returns false.

Attachment <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=9178482> should fix things as far as I can tell. Alphan's original patch that worked on linux went part of the way, but based on timing (which I found changed drastically between mac and linux) it wouldn't catch all cases. This patch does a lot more checking for actor's being destroyed before attempting to send a msg to transition the child to Fullscreen. I also needed to keep track in the parent when the msg had already been sent so that if the child died before it could reply we would still cleanup.

I have yet to test this on Windows, but I'm decently confident it will fix things based on my tracing/logging/testing of the pieces involved here.

Attaching the results of testing on Firefox Nightly 81.0a1 (2020-08-01) (on the left) and on the latest Firefox Nighty (On the right).

I'm not sure if exiting the full screen mode is the expected behavior here or should I look for something else here?

Thanks.

Yup, exiting full screen mode is the expected behaviour with the fix. Looks like it is working as intended.

Ya, probably worth considering. Patch coming soon, just need to make sure everything is still working properly after that graft.

Attached file
[drawimage-timing.zip](attachment.cgi?id=9152894)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9152894&action=edit)

Greetings,

I have discovered a timing side-channel that can be used recover parts of images located on 3rd party origins.

At least on my machine, calling drawImage(img, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1024, 1024) on a CanvasRenderingContext2D (which draws the top-left pixel of img onto the canvas, blown up to be 1024x1024) takes a measurably shorter amount of time when the top-left pixel is completely transparent (A = 0) than when it is completely opaque (A = 255), which in turn takes a measurably shorter time than when it is partially opaque (1 <= A <= 254).

Because img can be an image from a different origin, this can be used to figure out which of its pixels are transparent, thus inferring its outline.

I am attaching an archive that contains two proofs of concept:

* in the folder "benchmark" is a page that measures the performance of drawImage using source images of different colors and outputs a CSV (warning: it will lock up the renderer for a couple minutes). "drawimage\_timing.png" is a chart generated from the output of this benchmark on my machine, showing clearly the three different performance levels.
* in the folder "exploit" is a complete exploit that will reconstruct a 5x5 remote image in about 10s. Note that opening it will make a remote request to my server to load the target image. "exploit\_screenshot.png" is a screenshot showing it working successfully on my machine.

I am not sure how to make a PoC that would be easily integrated into a test suite, and am open to suggestions. Perhaps a version of "benchmark" that also runs a statistical test on its output could be helpful?

I have tested this on an empty profile on Firefox 76.0.1 64-bit, running on Linux 5.6.14 using X. As far as I can tell, here this behavior is ultimately caused by optimizations in Cairo, the graphics library used on this platform:

* CanvasRenderingContext2D::drawImage calls DrawTargetCairo::DrawSurface (gfx/2d/DrawTargetCairo.cpp),
* which calls PaintWithAlpha (gfx/2d/DrawTargetCairo.cpp),
* which calls cairo\_paint (gfx/cairo/cairo/src/cairo.c),
* which calls \_cairo\_gstate\_paint (gfx/cairo/cairo/src/cairo-gstate.c),
* which calls \_cairo\_surface\_paint (gfx/cairo/cairo/src/cairo-surface.c),
* which calls \_cairo\_pattern\_is\_clear in the same file. This function returns TRUE if the source is fully transparent, in which case \_cairo\_surface\_paint returns and we get the super-fast behavior for A = 0.

I am not yet sure where the difference in behavior in the 1 <= A <= 254 vs A = 255 cases is coming from, though that also sounds like a reasonable optimization a graphics library might perform.

I imagine similar behavior might be present on other platforms using other graphics libraries, but don't have a machine running a different OS to check. The benchmarking code I include should hopefully be helpful for diagnosing that.

My apologies, the machine hosting the target image for the exploit demo is down :( If you want to see the exploit in action, just replace the `src` attribute on line 21 of exploit/index.html with <https://p.2038.io/target_xsmall.png>

Can you give us the link to the chrome bug or at least the number? I realize their bug will be inaccessible but it's good to have the reference for later and also so we can talk to them about it if necessary.

We don't enable Cairo at all for any users by default. It's hidden behind a pref, and that pref only works on Linux. It's either Direct2D, or if not available (due to platform or unsupported), then Skia is otherwise always the default.

My bad, looks like I diagnosed this wrong. I saw the property `CairoUseXRender` in about:support and assumed that must mean Firefox was using Cairo, but I now see that the `AzureCanvasBackend` and `AzureContentBackend` properties are both set to `skia`. Let me see if I can track down the code in Skia that is causing this.

|  | |

Here's one place where Skia looks like it should have different performance for opaque vs non-opaque images:

DrawTragetSkia::DrawSurface → SkCanvas::drawImageRect → SkCanvas::onDrawImageRect. Through the macro DRAW\_BEGIN\_CHECK\_COMPLETE\_OVERWRITE, onDrawImageRect will pass the value of image->isOpaque() into SkCanvas::predrawNotify, which uses it to determine (lines 158-167 of gfx/skia/skia/src/core/SkCanvas.cpp in the 76.0.1 source tarball) whether to discard the surface.

You'd think that this means we should see worse performance if the surface cannot be discarded even on opaque draws, such as if I make the canvas slightly bigger than 1024×1024. But performance doesn't seem to change if I do that, so I'm not sure what's going on.

There are also other places where the isOpaque check is used, though, like SkBitmapScaler.

It seems that this behavior is likely caused by the short-circuiting optimizations in the function blit\_row\_s32a\_opaque() in gfx/skia/skia/src/opts/SkBlitRow\_opts.h.

Any updates on your side about the bug and/or bounty eligibility?

Do you have a proof of concept that actually shows the Skia path being affected, not just theoretically, but measurably in a profile?

The exploit attached to my original submission works on a default profile, which, as I understand from your earlier comment, runs Skia. Is there anything else you want me to demonstrate?

I would appreciate a profile from the Firefox profiler showing that it is in fact spending time where you believe it to be. That would help in making a further decision about what to do.

Ah, gotcha! Sorry, the ambiguity of the word “profile” confused me :)

Here's a link to a profile I just recorded while running the benchmark I previously attached (with the set of source images restricted to just three, rgba-0-0-0-{0,128,255}): <https://share.firefox.dev/3fNsFEg>

If I'm reading the flame graph right, looks like Skia really is spending basically all of the time in blit\_row\_s32a\_opaque, and there are three different stacks that end in that function, corresponding to the three different source images, with the runtime of blit\_row\_s32a\_opaque varying a lot depending on which image is used.

Looks like this has been fixed in Skia: [https://chromium.googlesource.com/skia/+/5d3314c53ce5c966591f0b02349103f51f986e6e](https://chromium.googlesource.com/skia/%2B/5d3314c53ce5c966591f0b02349103f51f986e6e)

Looks like the fix will go out in Chrome in November, and they expect to disclose the details of the bug in December.

Would you like somebody from Mozilla to be CCd on the Chrome bug?

Lee, do we have a separate bug for updating Skia or are we going to repurpose this one?

Just cherry-picking the relevant cleanup here from [https://chromium.googlesource.com/skia/+/5d3314c53ce5c966591f0b02349103f51f986e6e](https://chromium.googlesource.com/skia/%2B/5d3314c53ce5c966591f0b02349103f51f986e6e), as this wouldn't necessitate a Skia update by any stretch of the imagination.

Considering the "qe-verify+" tag, I have taken this bug to attempt to reproduce and verify. I have tried to see the difference between the affected and unaffected builds and these were my results:

* Ubuntu 20.04LTS, Nightly v83.0a1 from 2020-10-01:
  + both pages took quite a long time to show the results
    - benchmark folded index.html :

      rgba-0-0-0-0 116

      110 123 110

      108 114 125
    - exploit folder index.html :

      the reconstruction is very similar to the original
* Ubuntu 20.04LTS, Nightly v83.0a1 from 2020-10-18:
  + both pages took quite a long time to show the results
    - benchmark folded index.html :

      rgba-0-0-0-0 932

      932 1132 958

      936 938 938
    - exploit folder index.html :

      the reconstruction is very similar to a cube than the original

I do not know what the expected results would be or how I should properly verify this fix.

Lee, Can you help me verify it?

I would recommend the reporter verify.

Thanks for pointing me to the correct nightlies to check!

I have confirmed that I can still observe the difference in timing in Nightly 83.0a1 from 2020-10-01, but cannot observe it in Nightly 83.0a1 from 2020-10-18 (the benchmark shows comparable measurements for the three different colors, and the exploit does not reconstruct the original image, instead showing a random assortment of black/white pixels). So it seems that the fix worked.

This grafts cleanly to ESR78. I'm thinking we probably want to uplift this there also?

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2020-52

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 78.5

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 78.5

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Thunderbird's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

##### References

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Thunderbird this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2020-26968: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 78.5](#CVE-2020-26968)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Steve Fink, Jason Kratzer, Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, and Byron Campen reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
