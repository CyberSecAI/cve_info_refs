{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to craft malicious HTML forms to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trick a logged-in victim into unknowingly performing actions they did not intend, such as logging into an attacker-controlled account. The victim might then add or modify information while thinking they are using their legitimate account, but the changes are actually being made on the attacker's account.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafting a malicious HTML page containing a form that automatically submits a POST request to the login endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver or host a malicious HTML page that will be accessed by a logged-in victim. The attacker does not need any previous knowledge of the victim's credentials, just knowledge of the application's login endpoint and parameters."
