### v1.0.0 - 2023-06-01

#### Breaking changes

* Systemd v243+ is now required, and v245+ is recommended. Systemd v245 is
  available in for example Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+, and Rocky/CentOS 9+.
* Python 3.8+, JupyterHub 2.3.0+, and Tornado 5.1+ is now required.
* `SystemdSpawner.disable_user_sudo` (influences systemd's `NoNewPrivileges`)
  now defaults to `True`, making the installation more secure by default.

#### Maintenance and upkeep improvements

* Replace deprecated MemoryLimit with MemoryMax, remove fixme notes [#127](https://github.com/jupyterhub/systemdspawner/pull/127) ([@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio), [@yuvipanda](https://github.com/yuvipanda), [@behrmann](https://github.com/behrmann))
* Rely on systemd-run's --working-directory, and refactor for readability [#124](https://github.com/jupyterhub/systemdspawner/pull/124) ([@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio), [@behrmann](https://github.com/behrmann), [@minrk](https://github.com/minrk))
* Add MANIFEST.in to bundle LICENSE in source distribution [#122](https://github.com/jupyterhub/systemdspawner/pull/122) ([@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio), [@yuvipanda](https://github.com/yuvipanda))
* Add basic start/stop test against a jupyterhub [#120](https://github.com/jupyterhub/systemdspawner/pull/120) ([@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio), [@minrk](https://github.com/minrk), [@yuvipanda](https://github.com/yuvipanda))
* refactor: remove no longer needed pytest.mark.asyncio [#119](https://github.com/jupyterhub/systemdspawner/pull/119) ([@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio), [@yuvipanda](https://github.com/yuvipanda))
* Require systemd v243+, recommend systemd v245+, test against systemd v245 [#117](https://github.com/jupyterhub/systemdspawner/pull/117) ([@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio), [@yuvipanda](https://github.com/yuvipanda), [@minrk](https://github.com/minrk))
* Add test and release automation [#115](https://github.com/jupyterhub/systemdspawner/pull/115) ([@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio), [@yuvipanda](https://github.com/yuvipanda))
* maint, breaking: require python 3.8+, jupyterhub 2.3.0+, tornado 5.1+ [#114](https://github.com/jupyterhub/systemdspawner/pull/114) ([@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio), [@yuvipanda](https://github.com/yuvipanda))
* Add pre-commit for automated formatting [#108](https://github.com/jupyterhub/systemdspawner/pull/108) ([@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio), [@yuvipanda](https://github.com/yuvipanda))
* Disable user sudo by default [#91](https://github.com/jupyterhub/systemdspawner/pull/91) ([@yuvipanda](https://github.com/yuvipanda), [@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio))

#### Documentation improvements

## v0.17 - 2023-01-10

* Don't kill whole server when a single process OOMs,
  thanks to [@dragz](https://github.com/dragz) - [PR #101](https://github.com/jupyterhub/systemdspawner/pull/101)

## v0.16 - 2022-04-22

* User variables (like `{USERNAME}`) are expanded in `unit_extra_parameters`,
  thanks to [@tullis](https://github.com/tullis) - [PR #83](https://github.com/jupyterhub/systemdspawner/pull/83)
* Some cleanup of packaging metadata, thanks to [@minrk](https://github.com/minrk) -
  [PR #75](https://github.com/jupyterhub/systemdspawner/pull/75)

## v0.15 - 2020-12-07

Fixes vulnerability [GHSA-cg54-gpgr-4rm6](https://github.com/jupyterhub/systemdspawner/security/advisories/GHSA-cg54-gpgr-4rm6) affecting all previous releases.

* Use EnvironmentFile to pass environment variables to units.

## v0.14 - 2020-07-20

* define entrypoints for JupyterHub spawner configuration
* Fixes for CentOS 7

## v0.13 - 2019-04-28

### Bug Fixes

* Fix `slice` support by making it a configurable option

## v0.12 - 2019-04-17

### New Features

* Allow setting which **Systemd Slice** users' services should belong to.
  This lets admins set policy for all JupyterHub users in one go.
  [Thanks to [@mariusvniekerk](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk)]

### Bug Fixes

* Handle failed units that need reset.
  [thanks to [@RohitK89](https://github.com/RohitK89)]
* Fix bug in cleaning up services from a previously running
  JupyterHub. [thanks to [@minrk](https://github.com/minrk)]

## v0.11 - 2018-07-12

### New Features

* **Username templates** let you map jupyterhub usernames to different system usernames. Extremely
  useful for prefixing usernames to prevent collisions.

### Bug fixes

* Users' home directories now properly read from pwd database, rather than assumed to be under `/home`.
  Thanks to [@cpainterwakefield](https://github.com/cpainterwakefield) for reporting & suggested PR!

## v0.10 - 2018-07-11

### Breaking changes

* `use_sudo` option is no longer supported. It offered questionable security,
  and complicated the code unnecessarily. If 'securely run as normal user with
  sudo' is a required feature, we can re-implement it securely later.
* If a path in `readonly_paths` does not exist, spawning user will now fail.

### New features

* **Dynamic users** support, creating users as required with their own
  persistent homes with systemd's [dynamic users](http://0pointer.net/blog/dynamic-users-with-systemd.html)
  feature. Useful for using with tmpnb.
* **Add additional properties** to the user's systemd unit with `unit_extra_properties`.
  Thanks to [@kfix](https://github.com/kfix) for most of the work!

### Bug fixes

* If a user's notebook server service is already running, kill it before
  attempting to start a new one. [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jupyterhub/systemdspawner/issues/7)

### Dependency changes

* Python 3.5 is the minimum supported Python version.
* JupyterHub 0.9 is the minimum supported JupyterHub version.
* Tornado 5.0 is the minimum supported Tornado version.
