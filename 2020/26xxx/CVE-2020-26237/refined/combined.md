# Prototype Pollution

Moderate

[joshgoebel](/joshgoebel)
published
GHSA-vfrc-7r7c-w9mx
Nov 24, 2020

## Package

npm

highlight.js
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 8, 9, 10

## Patched versions

9.18.2, 10.1.2

## Description

### Impact

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. A malicious HTML code block can be crafted that will result in prototype pollution of the base object's prototype during highlighting. If you allow users to insert custom HTML code blocks into your page/app via parsing Markdown code blocks (or similar) and do not filter the language names the user can provide you may be vulnerable.

The pollution should just be harmless data but this can cause problems for applications not expecting these properties to exist and can result in strange behavior or application crashes, i.e. a potential DOS vector.

*If your website or application does not render user provided data it should be unaffected.*

### Patches

Versions 9.18.2 and 10.1.2 and newer include fixes for this vulnerability. If you are using version 7 or 8 you are encouraged to upgrade to a newer release.

### Workarounds

#### Patch your library

Manually patch your library to create null objects for both `languages` and `aliases`:

```
const HLJS = function(hljs) {
  // ...
  var languages = Object.create(null);
  var aliases = Object.create(null);
```
#### Filter out bad data from end users

Filter the language names that users are allowed to inject into your HTML to guarantee they are valid.

### @night **[night](/night)** commented [Jul 20, 2020](#issue-662277455)

`getLanguage` currently returns values for object prototype method names. By swapping to objects with a null prototype, we can fix this weird behavior.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Discord uses `getLanguage` to validate that a language specified exists in highlightJS and retrieve metadata about the language for code block highlighting in chat. Because highlightJS returns prototype values instead of the highlight languages themselves, the result is a few different bugs in our clients which expect the return type to be only `Language | undefined`. |

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Highlight.js is a syntax highlighter written in JavaScript. It works in
the browser as well as on the server. It can work with pretty much any
markup, doesnât depend on any other frameworks, and has automatic language
detection.

#### Upgrading to Version 11

As always, major releases do contain breaking changes which may require action from users. Please read [VERSION\_11\_UPGRADE.md](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/main/VERSION_11_UPGRADE.md) for a detailed summary of breaking changes and any actions you may need to take.

#### Support for older versions

Please see [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for long-term support information.

---

## Basic Usage

### In the Browser

The bare minimum for using highlight.js on a web page is linking to the
library along with one of the themes and calling [`highlightAll`](http://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#highlightall):

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/styles/default.min.css">
<script src="/path/to/highlight.min.js"></script>
<script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>
```

This will find and highlight code inside of `<pre><code>` tags; it tries
to detect the language automatically. If automatic detection doesnât
work for you, or you simply prefer to be explicit, you can specify the language manually by using the `class` attribute:

```
<pre><code class="language-html">...</code></pre>
```

#### Plaintext Code Blocks

To apply the Highlight.js styling to plaintext without actually highlighting it, use the `plaintext` language:

```
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">...</code></pre>
```

#### Ignoring a Code Block

To skip highlighting of a code block completely, use the `nohighlight` class:

```
<pre><code class="nohighlight">...</code></pre>
```

### Node.js on the Server

The bare minimum to auto-detect the language and highlight some code.

```
// load the library and ALL languages
hljs = require('highlight.js');
html = hljs.highlightAuto('<h1>Hello World!</h1>').value
```

To load only a "common" subset of popular languages:

```
hljs = require('highlight.js/lib/common');
```

To highlight code with a specific language, use `highlight`:

```
html = hljs.highlight('<h1>Hello World!</h1>', {language: 'xml'}).value
```

See [Importing the Library](#importing-the-library) for more examples of `require` vs `import` usage, etc. For more information about the result object returned by `highlight` or `highlightAuto` refer to the [api docs](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html).

## Supported Languages

Highlight.js supports over 180 languages in the core library. There are also 3rd party
language definitions available to support even more languages. You can find the full list of supported languages in [SUPPORTED\_LANGUAGES.md](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/main/SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES.md).

## Custom Usage

If you need a bit more control over the initialization of
Highlight.js, you can use the [`highlightElement`](http://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#highlightelement) and [`configure`](http://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#configure)
functions. This allows you to better control *what* to highlight and *when*.

For example, hereâs the rough equivalent of calling [`highlightAll`](http://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#highlightall) but doing the work manually instead:

```
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
  document.querySelectorAll('pre code').forEach((el) => {
    hljs.highlightElement(el);
  });
});
```

Please refer to the documentation for [`configure`](http://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#configure) options.

### Using custom HTML

We strongly recommend `<pre><code>` wrapping for code blocks. It's quite
semantic and "just works" out of the box with zero fiddling. It is possible to
use other HTML elements (or combos), but you may need to pay special attention to
preserving linebreaks.

Let's say your markup for code blocks uses divs:

```
<div class='code'>...</div>
```

To highlight such blocks manually:

```
// first, find all the div.code blocks
document.querySelectorAll('div.code').forEach(el => {
  // then highlight each
  hljs.highlightElement(el);
});
```

Without using a tag that preserves linebreaks (like `pre`) you'll need some
additional CSS to help preserve them. You could also [pre and post-process line
breaks with a plug-in](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/issues/2559), but *we recommend using CSS*.

To preserve linebreaks inside a `div` using CSS:

```
div.code {
  white-space: pre;
}
```

### Using with Vue.js

See [highlightjs/vue-plugin](https://github.com/highlightjs/vue-plugin) for a simple Vue plugin that works great with Highlight.js.

An example of `vue-plugin` in action:

```
  <div id="app">
    <!-- bind to a data property named `code` -->
    <highlightjs autodetect :code="code" />
    <!-- or literal code works as well -->
    <highlightjs language='javascript' code="var x = 5;" />
  </div>
```

### Using Web Workers

You can run highlighting inside a web worker to avoid freezing the browser
window while dealing with very big chunks of code.

In your main script:

```
addEventListener('load', () => {
  const code = document.querySelector('#code');
  const worker = new Worker('worker.js');
  worker.onmessage = (event) => { code.innerHTML = event.data; }
  worker.postMessage(code.textContent);
});
```

In worker.js:

```
onmessage = (event) => {
  importScripts('<path>/highlight.min.js');
  const result = self.hljs.highlightAuto(event.data);
  postMessage(result.value);
};
```

## Importing the Library

First, you'll likely be installing the library via `npm` or `yarn` -- see [Getting the Library](#getting-the-library).

### Node.js CommonJS Modules / `require`

Requiring the top-level library will load all languages:

```
// require the highlight.js library, including all languages
const hljs = require('./highlight.js');
const highlightedCode = hljs.highlightAuto('<span>Hello World!</span>').value
```

For a smaller footprint, load our common subset of languages (the same set used for our default web build).

```
const hljs = require('highlight.js/lib/common');
```

For the smallest footprint, load only the languages you need:

```
const hljs = require('highlight.js/lib/core');
hljs.registerLanguage('xml', require('highlight.js/lib/languages/xml'));

const highlightedCode = hljs.highlight('<span>Hello World!</span>', {language: 'xml'}).value
```

### Node.js ES6 Modules / `import`

The default import will register all languages:

```
import hljs from 'highlight.js';
```

It is more efficient to import only the library and register the languages you need:

```
import hljs from 'highlight.js/lib/core';
import javascript from 'highlight.js/lib/languages/javascript';
hljs.registerLanguage('javascript', javascript);
```

If your build tool processes CSS imports, you can also import the theme directly as a module:

```
import hljs from 'highlight.js';
import 'highlight.js/styles/github.css';
```

### Browser ES6 Modules

*Note: For now you'll want to install `@highlightjs/cdn-assets` package instead of `highlight.js`.
See [Download prebuilt CDN assets](#download-prebuilt-cdn-assets)*

To import the library and register only those languages that you need:

```
import hljs from './assets/js/@highlightjs/cdn-assets/es/core.js';
import javascript from './assets/js/@highlightjs/cdn-assets/es/languages/javascript.min.js';

hljs.registerLanguage('javascript', javascript);
```

To import the library and register all languages:

```
import hljs from './assets/js/@highlightjs/cdn-assets/es/highlight.js';
```

*Note: The path to these files will vary depending on where you have installed/copied them
within your project or site. The above path is only an example.*

You can also use [`importmap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap) to import in similar way as Node:

```
<script type="importmap">
{
	"imports": {
		"@highlightjs": "./assets/js/@highlightjs/cdn-assets/es/"
	}
}
</script>
```

Use the above code in your HTML. After that, your JavaScript can import using the named key from
your `importmap`, for example `@highlightjs` in this case:

```
import hljs from '@highlightjs/core.js';
import javascript from '@highlightjs/languages/javascript.min.js';

hljs.registerLanguage('javascript', javascript);
```

*Note: You can also import directly from fully static URLs, such as our very own pre-built ES6 Module CDN resources. See [Fetch via CDN](#fetch-via-cdn) for specific examples.*

## Getting the Library

You can get highlight.js as a hosted, or custom-build, browser script or
as a server module. Right out of the box the browser script supports
both AMD and CommonJS, so if you wish you can use RequireJS or
Browserify without having to build from source. The server module also
works perfectly fine with Browserify, but there is the option to use a
build specific to browsers rather than something meant for a server.

**Do not link to GitHub directly.** The library is not supposed to work straight
from the source, it requires building. If none of the pre-packaged options
work for you refer to the [building documentation](http://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building-testing.html).

**On Almond.** You need to use the optimizer to give the module a name. For
example:

```
r.js -o name=hljs paths.hljs=/path/to/highlight out=highlight.js
```

### Fetch via CDN

A prebuilt version of Highlight.js bundled with many common languages is hosted by several popular CDNs.
When using Highlight.js via CDN you can use Subresource Integrity for additional security. For details
see [DIGESTS.md](https://github.com/highlightjs/cdn-release/blob/main/DIGESTS.md).

```

**Note:** *The CDN-hosted `highlight.min.js` package doesn't bundle every language.* It would be
very large. You can find our list of "common" languages that we bundle by default on our [download page](https://highlightjs.org/download/).

### Download prebuilt CDN assets

You can also download and self-host the same assets we serve up via our own CDNs. We publish those builds to the [cdn-release](https://github.com/highlightjs/cdn-release) GitHub repository. You can easily pull individual files off the CDN endpoints with `curl`, etc; if say you only needed `highlight.min.js` and a single CSS file.

There is also an npm package [@highlightjs/cdn-assets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40highlightjs/cdn-assets) if pulling the assets in via `npm` or `yarn` would be easier for your build process.

### Download from our website

The [download page](https://highlightjs.org/download/) can quickly generate a custom single-file minified bundle including only the languages you desire.

**Note:** [Building from source](#build-from-source) can produce slightly smaller builds than the website download.

### Install via NPM package

Our NPM package including all supported languages can be installed with NPM or Yarn:

```
npm install highlight.js
# or
yarn add highlight.js
```

There is also another npm package [@highlightjs/cdn-assets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40highlightjs/cdn-assets) that contains prebuilt CDN assets including [ES6 Modules that can be imported in browser](#browser-es6-modules):

```
npm install @highlightjs/cdn-assets
# or
yarn add @highlightjs/cdn-assets
```

Alternatively, you can build the NPM package from source.

### Build from Source

The [current source code](https://github.com/highlightjs/) is always available on GitHub.

```
node tools/build.js -t node
node tools/build.js -t browser :common
node tools/build.js -t cdn :common
```

See our [building documentation](http://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building-testing.html) for more information.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

## Commit

[Permalink](/highlightjs/highlight.js/commit/7241013ae011a585983e176ddc0489a7a52f6bb0)

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

(parser) use null prototype objects for languages/aliases ([#2636](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/pull/2636))

```
Fix: Discord uses getLanguage to validate that a language specified exists in highlightJS and retrieve metadata about the language for code block highlighting in chat. Because highlightJS returns prototype values instead of the highlight languages themselves, the result is a few different bugs in our clients which expect the return type to be only `Language | undefined`.
```
