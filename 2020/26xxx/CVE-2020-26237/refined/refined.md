Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26237:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way `highlight.js` handles language definitions. Instead of using a null prototype object, it was using regular JavaScript objects. This allowed a malicious user to craft an HTML code block with a language name that could overwrite properties on the base object's prototype during highlighting, leading to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core issue is the ability to inject arbitrary properties into the prototype of the base object, due to the use of regular JavaScript objects for languages and aliases.
*   **Unfiltered User Input:** The vulnerability arises when user-supplied data, specifically language names within HTML code blocks, is not properly validated or sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Application Crashes and Strange Behavior:** Prototype pollution can lead to unexpected application behavior, including crashes and potential Denial of Service (DoS) scenarios. This is because applications may not anticipate the existence of these new properties. The injected properties can cause issues for applications that iterate over object properties, or when they perform type checks.
*   **Potential DoS:** Although the injected data itself may be harmless, the side effects of these unexpected properties can cause application instability, leading to potential denial-of-service conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious HTML Code Blocks:** An attacker crafts malicious HTML code blocks with crafted language names to trigger the prototype pollution.
*   **Markdown Parsing:** The primary vector is when user-provided input is used within a markdown parser to render code blocks, without properly filtering the language names. Any method allowing user controlled language names to reach highlight.js is a valid attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to inject HTML:** The attacker needs the capability to inject HTML code into a page or application that uses `highlight.js` for syntax highlighting.
*   **Control over language names**: The attacker must be able to manipulate the language names specified in the HTML code blocks.
*   **No authentication required**:  The attacker doesn't need any special privileges to cause the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `highlight.js` versions 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 8, 9, and 10.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in versions 9.18.2 and 10.1.2 by switching to using null prototype objects for both languages and aliases.
*   Workarounds include manually patching the library or filtering the language names that users are allowed to provide.
*   The vulnerability is considered to be of moderate severity.
*   The fix involves using `Object.create(null)` to create `languages` and `aliases`, effectively preventing access to the properties of the base `Object` prototype.
*   The issue was initially discovered and fixed by a contributor (`@night`) to address bugs in Discord's client.
*   Multiple third-party libraries and applications were also affected and later patched by upgrading their `highlight.js` dependencies.
*   The issue also made its way into Oracle products, as described in their advisory.
