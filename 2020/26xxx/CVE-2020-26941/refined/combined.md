# [CA7794] Local privilege escalation vulnerability fixed in ESET products for Windows

ESET Customer Advisory 2021-0001
January 18, 2021
Severity: Medium

### Summary

ESET was made aware of a vulnerability in its consumer, business, and server products for the Windows platform that allows users with limited rights to write a file or rewrite contents of an existing one, without having permissions to do so when ESET Self-defense was not active. ESET prepared installers with the issue fixed. We recommend using the latest versions of the installers available to ensure maximal protection.

### Details

ESET received a report stating that on a machine where an ESET product is being installed or upgraded, running on Windows operating system, it was possible to make changes in an ESET directory in a way that forced the product to write into files that would normally not be writable by the user, thus achieving privilege escalation.

This vulnerability emerged because during the installation process, protection is only being set up, thus self-defense is not yet fully active. Once the installation is finished and self-defense is activated, the attack is not possible anymore. Likewise, the attack is also possible in some other scenarios when self-defense is turned off.

Since the window of time, when self-defense is inactive during installation and upgrade, is narrow and it is difficult to control by an attacker, we believe that the chance of successfully exploiting this vulnerability is low.

Upgrades by means of Micro Program Component Update (uPCU) are not affected, standard PCU is affected. The already installed ESET security product is protected by the Self-defense mechanism, which is enabled by default.

**The reserved CVE ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2020-26941.**

To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing exploits in the wild that take advantage of this vulnerability.

### Solution

ESET has prepared fixed installation packages to be used by our customers to install and upgrade ESET security products:

* ESET File Security for Microsoft Windows Server, ESET Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange Server, ESET Mail Security for IBM Domino and ESET Security for Microsoft SharePoint Server 7.3
