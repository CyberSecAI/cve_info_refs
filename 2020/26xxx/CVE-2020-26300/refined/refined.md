{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `systeminformation` library did not properly sanitize service parameter strings before passing them to shell commands, leading to a command injection vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious commands into the service parameters, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the affected system.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting malicious service parameter strings and passing them to vulnerable functions within the `systeminformation` library, such as `is.services()`, `is.inetChecksite()`, `si.inetLatency()`, `si.networkStats()`, and `si.processLoad()`, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to control or influence the service parameter strings that are passed to vulnerable functions within the application that uses the `systeminformation` library."
  },
  "cve": "CVE-2020-26300",
  "details": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of service parameter strings before they are used in shell commands. This can allow attackers to inject arbitrary shell commands via these parameters. The fix implemented involves sanitizing shell strings, specifically by removing characters such as $, #, \\, tabs, new lines and double quotes, which can be used in command injection attacks. The affected versions are those below 4.26.2 and the patched version is 4.26.2 and later. The advisory also provides workarounds that users could implement in case an upgrade cannot be performed where users would need to manually sanitize service strings before passing them to the specified functions."
