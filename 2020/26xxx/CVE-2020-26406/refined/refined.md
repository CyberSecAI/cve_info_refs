Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE-2020-26406:** SAST CiConfiguration information visible for public/private projects without proper permissions.

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper permission checks when accessing SAST configuration information. Specifically, the SAST configuration data, which can be modified by users with sufficient privileges (e.g., Maintainers), is exposed to unauthorized users through a GraphQL query.

*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**
    *   Inadequate access control: Users without repository access in public projects and guest users in private projects can retrieve SAST configuration details.
    *   GraphQL endpoint exposure: The GraphQL API allows unauthorized access to sensitive SAST configuration data.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Unauthorized users can view the SAST configuration, potentially revealing security settings, rules, and customizations applied to the project's static analysis. This information could be leveraged to understand the project's security posture and identify potential weaknesses or bypasses.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   GraphQL query: An attacker can craft a GraphQL query to the `/api/graphql` endpoint to retrieve the SAST configuration.
    *   CSRF token and cookies: The attacker needs a valid CSRF token and cookies to authenticate the GraphQL request.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests: The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the GitLab GraphQL API.
    *   CSRF token and cookies: The attacker needs a valid CSRF token and session cookies for a GitLab user account (even one without access to the project in question).
    *   Knowledge of the project path: The attacker needs to know the full path (`<NameSpace>/<ProjectName>`) of the target project to include in the GraphQL query.
