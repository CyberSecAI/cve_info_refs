| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1885954#c0)  Michael Kaplan    2020-10-07 10:56:11 UTC  ``` The TCOS smart card software driver in OpenSC before 0.21.0-rc1 has a stack-based buffer overflow in tcos_decipher.  References:  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=22967> <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/commit/9d294de90d1cc66956389856e60b6944b27b4817>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1885954#c1)  Michael Kaplan    2020-10-07 10:56:51 UTC  ``` Created opensc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1885955](show_bug.cgi?id=1885955 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2020-26572 opensc: stack-based buffer overflow in tcos_decipher [epel-6]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1885956](show_bug.cgi?id=1885956 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-26572 opensc: stack-based buffer overflow in tcos_decipher [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1885954#c2)  Todd Cullum    2020-10-08 20:00:43 UTC  ``` Flaw summary:  In  the tcos_decipher() routine of src/libopensc/card-tcos.c, a call to `memcpy()` of size `crgram_len` could overflow past the end of the `sbuf` buffer, causing an out-of-bounds write. This could occur when `crgram_len` is greater than the size of `SC_MAX_APDU_BUFFER_SIZE`. The patch ensures that if `crgram_len` is greater than `sbuf - 1`, an error is returned instead.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1885954#c5)  Todd Cullum    2020-10-12 18:23:00 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  This flaw can be mitigated in cases where you can use opensc without the TCOS driver enabled. In such cases, the vulnerable driver can be disabled by specifying them in /etc/opensc.conf card_drivers field in allowlist fashion. One such example:  ``` app default {    card_drivers = cac, cac1, PIV-II; } ```  This would only enable the cac, cac1, and PIV-II smart card drivers, and all others would be disabled, including the TCOS driver. With the TCOS driver disabled, this flaw is mitigated. It is important to list all drivers that you need in the card_drivers field so that they are not disabled too.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1885954#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-05-18 13:35:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2021:1600 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1600](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A1600)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1885954#c8)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-05-18 20:36:38 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-26572>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1885950#c0)  Michael Kaplan    2020-10-07 10:54:36 UTC  ``` The gemsafe GPK smart card software driver in OpenSC before 0.21.0-rc1 has a stack-based buffer overflow in sc_pkcs15emu_gemsafeGPK_init.  References:  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=20612>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1885950#c1)  Michael Kaplan    2020-10-07 10:55:23 UTC  ``` Created opensc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1885951](show_bug.cgi?id=1885951 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2020-26571 opensc: stack-based buffer overflow in sc_pkcs15emu_gemsafeGPK_init [epel-6]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1885952](show_bug.cgi?id=1885952 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-26571 opensc: stack-based buffer overflow in sc_pkcs15emu_gemsafeGPK_init [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1885950#c2)  Todd Cullum    2020-10-08 19:54:08 UTC  ``` Flaw summary: In  `sc_pkcs15emu_gemsafeGPK_init()` routine in src/libopensc/pkcs15-gemsafeGPK.c, kinfo was defined as `keyinfo kinfo[8];` but an off-by-one error in loop `for (i = 7; i < 16; i++)` could access up to `kinfo[9]`, causing a stack buffer overflow and passing this to sc_read_record(), potentially causing an out-of-bounds write. The patch declares `keyinfo kinfo[9]` instead.  Upstream patch: <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/commit/ed55fcd2996930bf58b9bb57e9ba7b1f3a753c43>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1885950#c4)  Todd Cullum    2020-10-12 18:24:58 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  This flaw can be mitigated in cases where you can use opensc without the gemsafeGPK driver enabled. In such cases, the vulnerable driver can be disabled by specifying them in /etc/opensc.conf card_drivers field in allowlist fashion. One such example:  ``` app default {    card_drivers = cac, cac1, PIV-II; } ```  This would only enable the cac, cac1, and PIV-II smart card drivers, and all others would be disabled, including the gemsafeGPK driver. With the gemsafeGPK driver disabled, this flaw is mitigated. It is important to list all drivers that you need in the card_drivers field so that they are not disabled too.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1885950#c5)  Jakub Jelen    2020-10-20 16:54:54 UTC  ``` AFAIK, the fix for this issue is the following commit:  <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/commit/ed55fcd2996930bf58b9bb57e9ba7b1f3a753c43>  As mentioned in the issue, I was not able to reproduce the issue with the given vectors (and I am not able to reproduce it now either), but the following issue looks very similar:  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=22319>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1885950#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-05-18 13:35:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2021:1600 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1600](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A1600)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1885950#c8)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-05-18 20:36:35 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-26571>   ``` |  |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-7c80831ffe
2020-12-12 01:03:49.584409
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : opensc
Product : Fedora 33
Version : 0.21.0
Release : 1.fc33
URL : <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki>
Summary : Smart card library and applications
Description :
OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart cards. Its
main focus is on cards that support cryptographic operations, and facilitate
their use in security applications such as authentication, mail encryption and
digital signatures. OpenSC implements the PKCS#11 API so applications
supporting this API (such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird) can use it. On
the card OpenSC implements the PKCS#15 standard and aims to be compatible with
every software/card that does so, too.

Subject: OpenSC 0.21.0 released

Hi all!

I'm happy to finally announce the new release 0.21.0 of OpenSC
<<https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/releases/tag/0.21.0>>. You can read a full
summary of the changes and get the release binaries on GitHub. We recommend
upgrading your installation, most notably for fixing CVE-2020-26570,
CVE-2020-26571 and CVE-2020-26572.

We've not only focused on fixing many bugs with different cards and
environments from a variety of vendors. This release also adds support for
two new types of tokens, Gemalto IDPrime and Polish eID card (e-dowÃ³d, eDO).

Regards,
Frank Morgner.
