Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-26572:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `tcos_decipher` function within the TCOS smart card driver of the OpenSC library.
*   The overflow occurs because a `memcpy()` operation copies data from a source buffer (`crgram`) into a destination buffer (`sbuf`) on the stack, without proper bounds checking on `crgram_len` against the size of the `sbuf`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `memcpy()` operation can write past the end of the `sbuf` buffer on the stack when the length of the data to be copied is greater than the buffer's capacity.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary memory corruption due to an out-of-bounds write on the stack. This can cause a variety of effects, such as application crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves processing a crafted input (`crgram`) via the TCOS smart card driver. This means the attacker must be able to interact with a smart card that uses the vulnerable TCOS driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to supply the crafted input (`crgram`) to the TCOS driver to trigger the overflow during the `tcos_decipher` operation.
*   The attacker must have access to an interface (e.g., card reader) that uses OpenSC library and TCOS card driver.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is in `src/libopensc/card-tcos.c` in the `tcos_decipher()` function.
*   The `memcpy()` operation at line 626 copies `crgram_len` bytes from `crgram` to `sbuf+1`. `sbuf` is a stack buffer.
*   The fix adds a check before the `memcpy` to ensure that `crgram_len` is not greater than `sizeof sbuf - 1`, which will prevent the overflow.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading to OpenSC version 0.21.0-rc1 or later, which contains the fix.
*   As a temporary workaround, the TCOS driver can be disabled in the `/etc/opensc.conf` configuration file by allowing only other needed card drivers.
