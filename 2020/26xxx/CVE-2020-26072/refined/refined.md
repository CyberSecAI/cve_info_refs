- **Data Modification:**  The attacker can modify data on devices in different domains.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker sends SOAP API requests over the network.
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Cisco IoT FND.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the affected device.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco IoT FND releases earlier than Release 4.6.1.
- There are no workarounds available.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability in release 4.6.1 and later.
- The vulnerability was found through internal security testing.
