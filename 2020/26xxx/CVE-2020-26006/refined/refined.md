Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `account.php` file of the "online-examination-systen-in-php" application, allowing injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the vulnerability is a stored XSS where the malicious script is stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a vulnerable input field (likely on the account.php page).
*   This malicious script is stored in the database.
*   When a user visits the vulnerable page, the stored script is executed in their browser, triggering the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to input data into a vulnerable field of the application. This could be via a form submission or other input method.
*   No special privileges within the application are needed to inject the payload in the provided information.
