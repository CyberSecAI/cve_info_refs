Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26583:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient file upload restrictions within the expenses claiming functionality of Sage DPW. The application permits unauthenticated users to upload files without any authentication checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The application lacks proper authentication checks before allowing file uploads. This enables an attacker to upload files without needing valid credentials.
*   **Insufficient File Upload Restrictions:**  The application doesn't seem to validate the type or content of the uploaded files, allowing the upload of malicious files such as HTML or SVG with embedded JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By uploading malicious HTML or SVG files containing JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application's web page.
*   **Persistent XSS:** Since the uploaded files are stored on the server, the injected malicious scripts can be executed every time a user views the uploaded file, leading to a persistent XSS vulnerability.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The executed JavaScript can potentially steal user credentials, redirect users to malicious sites, alter the content of the displayed page, or perform other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct File Upload:** An attacker can directly upload malicious files through the expenses claiming functionality without needing authentication. This is performed by sending an HTTP POST request to `/nosso/cgiip.exe/WService=dpw_data/p-0820.p` with a base64 encoded malicious file and other necessary parameters.
*   **Luring Users:** Although viewing the uploaded files requires authentication, an attacker can lure an authenticated user to view the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Sage DPW application server to send malicious file upload requests.
*   **No Authentication Required For Upload**: The attacker does not require any login credentials to upload the malicious file. However, viewing the uploaded file requires an authenticated user.
*   **Knowledge of Application Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the specific URL for file uploads (`/nosso/cgiip.exe/WService=dpw_data/p-0820.p`) and the structure of the required POST parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory provides a detailed proof-of-concept, including the structure of the malicious SVG file and the unauthenticated upload request to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is present in Sage DPW versions 2020_06_000 and 2020_06_001 and is fixed in version 2020_06_002.
