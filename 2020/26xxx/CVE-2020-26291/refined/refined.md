Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26291:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper parsing of URLs within the `URI.js` library. Specifically, the library failed to correctly handle backslashes (`\`) within the authority component of a URL (the part before the path, e.g., `user@host:port`). Instead of treating the backslash as a forwardslash, as the WHATWG URL specification dictates, the library would misinterpret it, leading to potential hostname spoofing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Backslash Handling:** The core issue is that the library didn't normalize backslashes to forwardslashes in the authority part of the URL, which is a deviation from the standard URL parsing behavior.
- **Hostname Spoofing:** This leads to a hostname spoofing vulnerability, where an attacker can craft a URL with a backslash and an at symbol (`\`) that will trick the library into returning the wrong hostname.  For instance, a URL like `https://expected-example.com\@observed-example.com`  would be incorrectly parsed by vulnerable versions, returning `observed-example.com` as the hostname instead of `expected-example.com`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Decisions based on Spoofed Hostname:** If applications used the `URI.js` library to parse URLs, and then relied on the extracted hostname for security-sensitive operations, this could lead to several attacks.
- **Allow/Block List Bypasses:** An attacker could bypass allow or block lists that relied on the hostname.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** If the spoofed hostname was used to make server-side requests, this could lead to SSRF attacks.
- **Open Redirects:** If the hostname was used in constructing redirects, this could be exploited for open redirects.
- **Other Undesired Behavior:** The inaccurate parsing can cause other unexpected and potentially harmful behaviors depending on the specific application logic using the library.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs that include backslashes (`\`) within the authority component, followed by an at symbol (`@`).
- The crafted URL would be fed into the vulnerable `URI.js` library, which would then incorrectly parse it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply or influence the URL that is parsed by the vulnerable `URI.js` library. This could happen via various means depending on where the URL is used in the application, such as:
    - User input to the application
    - Manipulation of a URL passed to the application
    - Data provided by an external system to the application

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Alesandro Ortiz.
- The issue was addressed in version 1.19.4 of `URI.js`. Version 1.19.3 had a partial fix but was still vulnerable.
- The fix involves rewriting backslashes to forward slashes in the `parseAuthority` function.

This vulnerability highlights the importance of adhering to URL parsing standards and the potential for security issues when libraries deviate from these standards.
