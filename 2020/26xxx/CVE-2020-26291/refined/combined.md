# Hostname spoofing via backslashes in URL

Moderate

[rodneyrehm](/rodneyrehm)
published
GHSA-3329-pjwv-fjpg
Dec 30, 2020

## Package

npm

urijs
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.19.4

## Patched versions

1.19.4

## Description

### Impact

If using affected versions to determine a URL's hostname, the hostname can be spoofed by using a backslash (`\`) character followed by an at (`@`) character. If the hostname is used in security decisions, the decision may be incorrect.

Depending on library usage and attacker intent, impacts may include allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired behavior.

Example URL: `https://expected-example.com\@observed-example.com`

Escaped string: `https://expected-example.com\\@observed-example.com` (JavaScript strings must escape backslash)

Affected versions incorrectly return `observed-example.com`. Patched versions correctly return `expected-example.com`. Patched versions match the behavior of other parsers which implement the [WHATWG URL specification](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/), including web browsers and [Node's built-in URL class](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html).

### Patches

Version 1.19.4 is patched against all known payload variants. Version 1.19.3 has a partial patch but is still vulnerable to a payload variant.

### References

<https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/releases/tag/v1.19.4> (complete fix for this bypass)

<https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/releases/tag/v1.19.3> (partial fix for this bypass)

[PR #233](https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/pull/233) (initial fix for backslash handling)

> **IMPORTANT:** You **may not need URI.js** anymore! Modern browsers provide the [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) and [URLSearchParams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) interfaces.

---

> **NOTE:** The npm package name changed to `urijs`

---

I always want to shoot myself in the head when looking at code like the following:

```
var url = "http://example.org/foo?bar=baz";
var separator = url.indexOf('?') > -1 ? '&' : '?';

url += separator + encodeURIComponent("foo") + "=" + encodeURIComponent("bar");
```

Things are looking up with [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/URL) and the [URL spec](http://url.spec.whatwg.org/) but until we can safely rely on that API, have a look at URI.js for a clean and simple API for mutating URIs:

```
var url = new URI("http://example.org/foo?bar=baz");
url.addQuery("foo", "bar");
```

URI.js is here to help with that.

## API Example

```
// mutating URLs
URI("http://example.org/foo.html?hello=world")
  .username("rodneyrehm")
    // -> http://rodneyrehm@example.org/foo.html?hello=world
  .username("")
    // -> http://example.org/foo.html?hello=world
  .directory("bar")
    // -> http://example.org/bar/foo.html?hello=world
  .suffix("xml")
    // -> http://example.org/bar/foo.xml?hello=world
  .query("")
    // -> http://example.org/bar/foo.xml
  .tld("com")
    // -> http://example.com/bar/foo.xml
  .query({ foo: "bar", hello: ["world", "mars"] });
    // -> http://example.com/bar/foo.xml?foo=bar&hello=world&hello=mars

// cleaning things up
URI("?&foo=bar&&foo=bar&foo=baz&")
  .normalizeQuery();
    // -> ?foo=bar&foo=baz

// working with relative paths
URI("/foo/bar/baz.html")
  .relativeTo("/foo/bar/world.html");
    // -> ./baz.html

URI("/foo/bar/baz.html")
  .relativeTo("/foo/bar/sub/world.html")
    // -> ../baz.html
  .absoluteTo("/foo/bar/sub/world.html");
    // -> /foo/bar/baz.html

// URI Templates
URI.expand("/foo/{dir}/{file}", {
  dir: "bar",
  file: "world.html"
});
// -> /foo/bar/world.html
```

See the [About Page](http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/) and [API Docs](http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/docs.html) for more stuff.

## Using URI.js

URI.js (without plugins) has a gzipped weight of about 7KB - if you include all extensions you end up at about 13KB. So unless you *need* second level domain support and use URI templates, we suggest you don't include them in your build. If you don't need a full featured URI mangler, it may be worth looking into the much smaller parser-only alternatives [listed below](#alternatives).

URI.js is available through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/urijs), [bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=urijs), [bowercdn](http://bowercdn.net/package/urijs), [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/URI.js) and manually from the [build page](http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/build.html):

```
# using bower
bower install uri.js

# using npm
npm install urijs
```

### Browser

I guess you'll manage to use the [build tool](http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/build.html) or follow the [instructions below](#minify) to combine and minify the various files into URI.min.js - and I'm fairly certain you know how to `<script src=".../URI.min.js"></script>` that sucker, too.

### Node.js and NPM

Install with `npm install urijs` or add `"urijs"` to the dependencies in your `package.json`.

```
// load URI.js
var URI = require('urijs');
// load an optional module (e.g. URITemplate)
var URITemplate = require('urijs/src/URITemplate');

URI("/foo/bar/baz.html")
  .relativeTo("/foo/bar/sub/world.html")
    // -> ../baz.html
```

### RequireJS

Clone the URI.js repository or use a package manager to get URI.js into your project.

```
require.config({
  paths: {
    urijs: 'where-you-put-uri.js/src'
  }
});

require(['urijs/URI'], function(URI) {
  console.log("URI.js and dependencies: ", URI("//amazon.co.uk").is('sld') ? 'loaded' : 'failed');
});
require(['urijs/URITemplate'], function(URITemplate) {
  console.log("URITemplate.js and dependencies: ", URITemplate._cache ? 'loaded' : 'failed');
});
```

## Minify

See the [build tool](http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/build.html) or use [Google Closure Compiler](http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home):

```
// ==ClosureCompiler==
// @compilation_level SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS
// @output_file_name URI.min.js
// @code_url http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/src/IPv6.js
// @code_url http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/src/punycode.js
// @code_url http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/src/SecondLevelDomains.js
// @code_url http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/src/URI.js
// @code_url http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/src/URITemplate.js
// ==/ClosureCompiler==

```

---

> **IMPORTANT:** You **may not need URI.js** anymore! Modern browsers provide the [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) and [URLSearchParams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) interfaces.

---

> **NOTE:** The npm package name changed to `urijs`

---

I always want to shoot myself in the head when looking at code like the following:

```
var url = "http://example.org/foo?bar=baz";
var separator = url.indexOf('?') > -1 ? '&' : '?';

url += separator + encodeURIComponent("foo") + "=" + encodeURIComponent("bar");
```

Things are looking up with [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/URL) and the [URL spec](http://url.spec.whatwg.org/) but until we can safely rely on that API, have a look at URI.js for a clean and simple API for mutating URIs:

```
var url = new URI("http://example.org/foo?bar=baz");
url.addQuery("foo", "bar");
```

URI.js is here to help with that.

## API Example

```
// mutating URLs
URI("http://example.org/foo.html?hello=world")
  .username("rodneyrehm")
    // -> http://rodneyrehm@example.org/foo.html?hello=world
  .username("")
    // -> http://example.org/foo.html?hello=world
  .directory("bar")
    // -> http://example.org/bar/foo.html?hello=world
  .suffix("xml")
    // -> http://example.org/bar/foo.xml?hello=world
  .query("")
    // -> http://example.org/bar/foo.xml
  .tld("com")
    // -> http://example.com/bar/foo.xml
  .query({ foo: "bar", hello: ["world", "mars"] });
    // -> http://example.com/bar/foo.xml?foo=bar&hello=world&hello=mars

// cleaning things up
URI("?&foo=bar&&foo=bar&foo=baz&")
  .normalizeQuery();
    // -> ?foo=bar&foo=baz

// working with relative paths
URI("/foo/bar/baz.html")
  .relativeTo("/foo/bar/world.html");
    // -> ./baz.html

URI("/foo/bar/baz.html")
  .relativeTo("/foo/bar/sub/world.html")
    // -> ../baz.html
  .absoluteTo("/foo/bar/sub/world.html");
    // -> /foo/bar/baz.html

// URI Templates
URI.expand("/foo/{dir}/{file}", {
  dir: "bar",
  file: "world.html"
});
// -> /foo/bar/world.html
```

See the [About Page](http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/) and [API Docs](http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/docs.html) for more stuff.

## Using URI.js

URI.js (without plugins) has a gzipped weight of about 7KB - if you include all extensions you end up at about 13KB. So unless you *need* second level domain support and use URI templates, we suggest you don't include them in your build. If you don't need a full featured URI mangler, it may be worth looking into the much smaller parser-only alternatives [listed below](#alternatives).

URI.js is available through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/urijs), [bower](http://bower.io/search/?q=urijs), [bowercdn](http://bowercdn.net/package/urijs), [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/URI.js) and manually from the [build page](http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/build.html):

```
# using bower
bower install uri.js

# using npm
npm install urijs
```
### Browser

I guess you'll manage to use the [build tool](http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/build.html) or follow the [instructions below](#minify) to combine and minify the various files into URI.min.js - and I'm fairly certain you know how to `<script src=".../URI.min.js"></script>` that sucker, too.

### Node.js and NPM

Install with `npm install urijs` or add `"urijs"` to the dependencies in your `package.json`.

```
// load URI.js
var URI = require('urijs');
// load an optional module (e.g. URITemplate)
var URITemplate = require('urijs/src/URITemplate');

URI("/foo/bar/baz.html")
  .relativeTo("/foo/bar/sub/world.html")
    // -> ../baz.html
```
### RequireJS

Clone the URI.js repository or use a package manager to get URI.js into your project.

```
require.config({
  paths: {
    urijs: 'where-you-put-uri.js/src'
  }
});

require(['urijs/URI'], function(URI) {
  console.log("URI.js and dependencies: ", URI("//amazon.co.uk").is('sld') ? 'loaded' : 'failed');
});
require(['urijs/URITemplate'], function(URITemplate) {
  console.log("URITemplate.js and dependencies: ", URITemplate._cache ? 'loaded' : 'failed');
});
```
## Minify

See the [build tool](http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/build.html) or use [Google Closure Compiler](http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home):

```
// ==ClosureCompiler==
// @compilation_level SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS
// @output_file_name URI.min.js
// @code_url http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/src/IPv6.js
// @code_url http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/src/punycode.js
// @code_url http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/src/SecondLevelDomains.js
// @code_url http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/src/URI.js
// @code_url http://medialize.github.io/URI.js/src/URITemplate.js
// ==/ClosureCompiler==

```
