```
--------------------------------------------------------------
qdPM <= 9.1 (executeExport) PHP Object Injection Vulnerability
--------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Software Link:

<http://qdpm.net>

[-] Affected Versions:

Version 9.1 and prior versions.

[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability is located in the
/core/apps/qdPM/modules/timeReport/actions/actions.class.php
script, specifically within the timeReportActions::executeExport() method:

295. public function executeExport(sfWebRequest $request)
296. {
297.   $separator = "\t";
298.   $format = $request->getParameter('format');
299.   $filename = $request->getParameter('filename');
300.
301.   $export = unserialize($request->getParameter('export'));

User input passed through the "export" request parameter is not
properly sanitized before being
used in a call to the unserialize() function at line 301. This can be
exploited by malicious users
to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application scope, allowing
them to carry out a variety
of attacks, such as executing arbitrary OS commands.

[-] Proof of Concept:

<http://karmainsecurity.com/pocs/CVE-2020-26165>
