Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26165:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `unserialize()` function in the `timeReportActions::executeExport()` method within the `/core/apps/qdPM/modules/timeReport/actions/actions.class.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **PHP Object Injection:** The application directly takes user-supplied input from the `export` request parameter and passes it to `unserialize()` without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application's scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands or perform other malicious activities. This is a consequence of the attacker's ability to control the objects being unserialized, and crafting a payload that contains malicious object which executes arbitrary code during unserialization.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious serialized PHP object and provides it as the value of the `export` parameter in an HTTP request. The vulnerable `executeExport` function then unserializes this object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to the Application:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application to access the vulnerable `timeReportActions::executeExport` method.
- **Knowledge of PHP:** The attacker needs some familiarity with PHP object serialization and how to create a payload containing malicious objects for the application to unserialize.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in qdPM version 9.1 and prior.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is available at `http://karmainsecurity.com/pocs/CVE-2020-26165`.
- The vendor was notified multiple times but did not provide a patch for the vulnerability when it was disclosed publicly.
