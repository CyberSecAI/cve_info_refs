- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CGM files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs while copying to a buffer during font string handling.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted CGM file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious CGM file to the user and convince the user to open the file using the vulnerable application.
