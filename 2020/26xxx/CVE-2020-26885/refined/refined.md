Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. It stems from the improper handling of user-supplied input within the application, specifically the `sxcver` parameter in one instance and an unspecified parameter within the anchor tag in another instance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected XSS: The application doesn't sanitize or properly encode user-provided data before including it in the HTML output.
- The vulnerability is present in the sxcver parameter of the `/DesktopModles/tosic_sexycontent/dist/dnn/ui.html` page.
- The vulnerability can also be exploited using an anchor tag within a URL

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which will then execute in the victim's browser.
- This can lead to various malicious activities like:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Parameter:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the sxcver parameter, and tricks the user into accessing it. E.g.:
   `"/DesktopModles/tosic_sexycontent/dist/dnn/ui.html?sxcver=\"><IMG%20SRC=%23%20onerror=\"alert('xss')\">"`
 - **Anchor Tag:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the anchor tag, and tricks the user into accessing it. E.g.:
   `/test.html#variable1=true&app=3&version=">IMG%20SRC=%23%20onerror="alert('burninatorsec')">`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking on the malicious link, typically via social engineering or other means.
- The attacker doesn't need access to the server itself.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability was found by "burninatorsec".
*   The vulnerability affects versions 8-11 of 2sxc, with version 11 having the highest risk.
*   Version 11.22 LTS is not affected.
*   2sic was quick to respond and fix the issue.
*   The fix is in this file: `https://github.com/2sic/eav-item-dialog-angular/blob/develop/projects/ng-dialogs/src/index.html#L33-L42`.
*   2sxc also published a security notification on their blog: `https://2SXC.org/en/blog/post/2sxc-security-notification-2021-001`.
*   AWS WAF made it difficult to get XSS payloads through to the server, hence the usage of the anchor tag.
