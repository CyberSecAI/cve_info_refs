{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The CSRF token validation depends on the request method. When the request method is changed from POST to GET, the token validation is omitted by the backend.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can change the administrator's email address.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload that, when executed in the admin's browser via an XSS vulnerability, sends a GET request to change the admin's email address.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to inject JavaScript into a course description field, which is then viewed by an admin user, triggering the XSS and CSRF attack. The attacker also needs to know the target's host address."
