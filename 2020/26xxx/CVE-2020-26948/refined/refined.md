Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26948:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaw in the Emby media server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SSRF:** The Emby server can be tricked into making HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs, including internal network resources. This allows an attacker to scan internal networks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Internal Network Scanning:** An attacker can use the Emby server to scan the internal network it resides on. This allows discovery of other internal services and systems that would normally be inaccessible from the outside.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** By discovering internal services, the attacker could potentially leverage other vulnerabilities to compromise the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to send a specially crafted request to the vulnerable Emby server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the publicly accessible port of the vulnerable Emby server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific endpoint that is vulnerable to SSRF on the Emby server.
*   **Metasploit Module:** The content shows use of a Metasploit module, which indicates the vulnerability has been formalized and can easily be exploited using this tool.

**Additional Details (From Content):**

*   The provided Ruby scripts ( `emby_version_ssrf.rb` and `emby_ssrf_scanner.rb` ) are Metasploit modules designed to test for and exploit this vulnerability.
*   The `emby_version_ssrf` module can identify the Emby version and internal IP address of the server, which may be used to verify that the server is vulnerable.
*   The `emby_ssrf_scanner` module allows an attacker to specify a target network and perform HTTP scans by exploiting the SSRF.
*   The example provided in the content demonstrates scanning of internal networks using these modules.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description by including the Metasploit modules and demonstrating the specific process to scan internal networks.
