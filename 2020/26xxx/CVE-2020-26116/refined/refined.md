    "cve": "CVE-2020-26116",
    "root_cause": "The `http.client` module in Python does not properly validate HTTP method names, allowing control characters to be injected into the HTTP method, leading to HTTP header injection.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "HTTP Header Injection",
      "CRLF injection"

      "Manipulating the HTTP method parameter in http.client.putrequest"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the HTTP request method parameter.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because the http.client module doesn't reject control characters within the HTTP method name when constructing an HTTP request. This can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP method string containing newline characters which will be interpreted as header injection by the server."
