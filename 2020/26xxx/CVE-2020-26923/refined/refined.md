{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored cross-site scripting (XSS).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact is not explicitly described beyond the classification as 'Medium'. It is rated as having low confidentiality and low integrity impact with no availability impact, and successful exploitation would require a user interaction. The stored XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application that will be executed when a user views the affected content. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), requiring the attacker to be on the same network segment.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H) to inject the malicious script. Exploitation requires user interaction (UI:R), and the vulnerability scope is changed (S:C)."
