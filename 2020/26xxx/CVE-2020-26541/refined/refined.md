This content provides a patch for the Linux kernel to add support for `EFI_CERT_X509_GUID` entries in the Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (dbx). This is relevant to the CVE description, as it addresses the parsing of X.509 certificates used in UEFI secure boot.

Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Linux kernel's lack of support for `EFI_CERT_X509_GUID` entries within the UEFI Secure Boot dbx. The kernel was previously skipping these entries, meaning that revoked X.509 certificates were not being blacklisted, allowing potentially vulnerable or malicious software to bypass secure boot protections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Functionality:** The core issue was the missing implementation for processing `EFI_CERT_X509_GUID` entries in the dbx.
*   **Bypass of Secure Boot:** The lack of proper handling allowed revoked X.509 certificates to be used to boot the system, effectively circumventing Secure Boot protections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially use a revoked X.509 certificate (present in the dbx) to bypass secure boot and load a malicious operating system or bootloader. This would allow them to gain full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is via a compromised boot process where a malicious or revoked certificate is used to sign the boot components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to modify the boot process to use a revoked X.509 certificate which is present in the dbx.
*   The attacker needs to know of vulnerable/revoked X.509 certificates.

**Patch Details:**

The provided patch introduces the following changes:

*   **`certs/blacklist.c`**:
    *   Adds `mark_key_revocationlisted` to add X.509 certs to a blacklist keyring.
    *   Adds `is_key_revocationlisted` to check if a given PKCS#7 message is signed by a revoked certificate.
*   **`certs/blacklist.h`**:
    *   Declares the new functions.
    *   Introduces the `validate_trust` macro.
*   **`certs/system_keyring.c`**:
    *   Calls `is_key_revocationlisted` to ensure a pkcs7 message is not revoked before trusting it.
*   **`include/keys/system_keyring.h`**:
    *   Declares external functions.
*   **`security/integrity/platform_certs/keyring_handler.c`**:
    *   Adds `uefi_revocationlist_x509` as a handler for `EFI_CERT_X509_GUID` entries, calling `mark_key_revocationlisted`
    *   Adds the handler to the list of `efi_element_handler`

This patch enhances the kernel's Secure Boot implementation by ensuring that revoked X.509 certificates in the dbx are properly blacklisted and cannot be used to bypass secure boot.
