## Release 2.8.1

Fixes a problem introduced in 2.8.0 for machines whose ID is in /etc/machine-id #3886
Many thanks to contributor @avestuk for this fix.

Also move Kubernetes API calls out of Weave Net daemon #3885

* this reduces the size of the 'weaver' binary and stops it crashing when run on 32-bit ARM.

## Release 2.8.0

This release makes some important changes to trim the "attack surface" of the
Kubernetes install, and improves a couple of reported issues.

* Workaround to fix ipset conflict with iptables #3851, #3882
* Kubernetes: move kernel and CNI setup to init container #3880
* For K8s, stop running in host PID namespace #3876
* NetworkPolicy: avoid logging dropped packets that were not actually dropped #3852
* Build with Go version 1.15.6 #3883

Many thanks to contributors @drigz, @KevDBG and @NeonSludge.

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/87?closed=1)

## Release 2.7.0

This release improves resiliency in a number of areas,
and extends the Prometheus metrics exported by Weave Net.

Change in behaviour: on Kubernetes, the client source IP is preserved
when calling from a pod to a service.
This feature, introduced in version 2.4.0 and previously turned on by
setting `NO_MASQ_LOCAL=1` is now on by default. #3389, #3756

### Features

* Reload router iptables rules if they get cleared, e.g. when firewalld restarts. #3802
  (weave-npc rules are not reloaded)
* Add new `type` and `encryption` labels to `weave_connections` metric #3788, #3789
* Weave Net now exports Go metrics for heap size, garbage collection, etc. #3838
* Register container name and its network aliases with weaveDNS #3084, #3090
* Make DNS listen address configurable #1770, #3231

### Bug fixes

* weave-npc could crash if you deleted a Kubernetes Namespace containing pods #3833, #3836
* Ensure that weave-npc exits and restarts if it crashes #3764, #3792, #3841
* Avoid weave-kube failing on startup due to iptables lock #3828, #3835

### Build and test

* Reduce size of containers (weaveworks/weave goes from 99MB to 83MB) #3624, #3726
* Weave Net is now built with Go 1.14.4, which should improve performance #3838
* CI tests are now run against Docker 19.03.1, Kubernetes 1.14.0 #3687

Many thanks to contributors @berlic, @gobomb, @hairyhenderson, @naemono, @nesc58

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/81?closed=1)

## Release 2.6.5

Fixes a bug that would leak memory every time a fast-datapath connection
was stopped. #3808
Also avoid a crash when the machine has ipv6 disabled. #3815

## Release 2.6.4

Improves the iptables rule added in 2.6.3 to block just the Weave Net
control port and avoid blocking other uses of 127.0.0.1. #3811

## Release 2.6.3

This release has a couple of security improvements, and some other fixes.

* Block non-local traffic to the Weave control port #3805
* Tell Linux not to accept router advisory messages #3801
* Network Policy Controller: add a metric to show errors while operating #3804

  prevent CPU spinning #3782

## Release 2.6.1

This release fixes a bug discovered since the release of Weave Net 2.6.0 and
an improvement to support iptables 1.8

### Bug fixes

* Weave Net on node restart unable to form connections to peers and connections get stuck in
  pending state and stops responding to API endpoint #3762 #3763

### Other improvements

* Weave Net Kubernetes images by default uses iptables 1.8 with legacy (netfilter) backend with
  option to choose netfilter as backend #3465, #3747

## Release 2.6.0

This release reduces CPU and memory usage in larger clusters, by
sending notifications to a smaller set of peers and coalescing updates
to reduce topology recalculation. #3715, #3732

The default soft limit on connections has been raised from 100 to 200.

### Bug fixes

* Fix a race condition in Kubernetes addon when reclaiming IP
  addresses after node deletion #3724, #3716
* Buffer events so Docker won't drop them, and Weave Net can clean up
  after dead containers #3432, #3705
* Weave reconnect occasionally fails after network interface
  disconnect #3666, #3669, #3676

## Release 2.4.1

This release fixes several bugs causing inconsistencies in IPAM for
Kubernetes users whose clusters scale up and down over time.

### Bug fixes

* Nodes unable to connect after Kubernetes addon erroneously reclaimed
  node without any IP addresses #3392, #3393
* Kubernetes addon could have run out of free IP addresses after nodes
  are deleted #3384, #3400
* Kubernetes addon had reduced free IP addresses due to not reclaiming
  IP addresses when node name is re-used #3397

### Other improvements

* Support `--label` in `WEAVE_DOCKER_ARGS` when starting Weave #3370,#3371
* Add missing `--token` argument in help for `weave launch` #3226, #3379
* Print defunct processes after smoke-tests #3362

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/75?closed=1)

## Release 2.4.0

This release introduces a support for Kubernetes Egress Network Policy (#2624, #3313)
and adds a mechanism for preserving the client source IP address to enable
`externalTrafficPolicy: Local` on Kubernetes (#2924, #3298).

### Bug fixes

* Increase the ipset list size which prevents weave-npc from crashing on older
  kernels when more than eight Kubernetes Namespaces are used (#3289, #3305).
* Avoid a possible livelock when reclaiming IP address space in weave-kube (#3317).
* Ensure `xtables.lock` is mounted as a file so that kube-proxy can take the lock
  if it has started after Weave Net (#3351, #3353).
* Upgrade the CNI plugin symlinks only if the plugin has changed (#3337, #3345).

### Other improvements

* Manipulate the Kubernetes node status `NetworkUnavailable` so that Pods can be
  scheduled on nodes when the GCE cloud provider is in use (#3249, #3307, #3332, #3334).
* Refrain from creating a subprocess for configuring a network interface in
  a container network namespace (#3291).
* Protect against handling the CNI plugin request with the host namespace which
  prevents Weave Net from misconfiguring the host network (#3206, #3346).
* Weave Net can be run on minikube VM (#3124).
* Add `org.opencontainers.image.*` labels to Dockerfiles to improve association
  of the container images with git revisions (#3299).
* Improve the error message when running `weave reset` on Kubernetes (#3319).

### Build and Testing

* Use `dep` instead of `git submodules` for managing external packages (#3268).
* Fix usage of `manifest-tool` in Makefile (#3320).
* Update Kubernetes to 1.11 for the integration tests (#3340).

## Release 2.3.0

### Security fixes

* By default, do not expose Weave "/status" and "/report" to all (0.0.0.0) when
  running on Kubernetes #3271

### Other improvements

* Increase the default connection limit for Weave peers (from 30 to 100) when
  running on Kubernetes, so that more peers could directly connect #3265

## Build and test

* Build Weave Net with Go 1.10.1 #3273
* Run integration tests against Kubernetes 1.10.0 #3266

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/70?closed=1)

## Release 2.2.1

### Bug fixes

* Fix a bug in weave-npc which would allow ingress traffic to Kubernetes Pods selected
  by a NetworkPolicy in which source and destination selectors were the same #3222,#3237
* Fix a bug in weave-npc which would crash if a previously deleted Kubernetes Namespace
  has been created again #3247,#3250

### Other improvements

* Increase the default connection limit for Weave peers (from 30 to 100), so that
  more peers could directly connect #3234
* When doing a rolling update of Weave Net on Kubernetes, allow each node five seconds
  to initialize before rolling next Weave Net Pod, so that issues at startup will halt
  the rollout and not spread across the whole cluster #3235
* Install common CA certificates from Alpine Linux package instead of copying
  them manually #3236

## Release 2.2.0

This release improves the way Weave Net configures Linux network
devices and network filter rules, so that it is more robust in the face
of unexpected changes in its environment. #3204,#3224

As a consequence of these changes, the `weave attach` command will now
fail unless the Weave Net daemon is up and running - previously it was
possible to run independently as long as you managed all IP addresses
yourself.

## Other improvements

* Update library miekg/dns for CVE-2017-15133 (details under embargo) #3223,#3227
* Reduce the volume of logging from weave-npc #3183
* Add ability to set log level for Docker "v2" plugin, and change
  default log level from DEBUG to INFO #3197
* Downgrade log messages about Discovery and Expiration to DEBUG level #3202,#3203
* Use command-line parameter for WeaveDNS address in Docker proxy #3196

## Bug fixes

* Ensure that rules to block traffic for NetworkPolicy are placed
  ahead of rules that Kubernetes has added to allow other traffic #3209,#3210

## Build and test

* Update CI tests to use Kubernetes 1.9.2 #3229
* Remove "daily update" from test VMs that only run for a few minutes #3224

## Release 2.1.3

This release fixes a race-condition in the IP reclaim code for weave-kube
where two nodes could end up fighting over the same space and break
connectivity #3190, #3192

## Release 2.1.2

This release fixes a couple of bugs discovered since the release of Weave Net 2.1.0

##Bug fixes

* Fix crash seen when starting 10-15 nodes simultaneously #3184,#3186

## Release 2.1.1

As 2.1.0, but fixing a couple of installation glitches. #3175,#3176

## Release 2.1.0

##New Features

Improved Kubernetes Network Policy - Weave Net now supports the
'v1' policies introduced in Kubernetes 1.7 as well as the 'beta'
policies supported previously. See [Kubernetes 1.7 changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.7.md#network)
for differences. To use old policies, `--use-legacy-netpol` argument
should be passed to `weave-npc`. #3105,#3141,#3151,#3169

Weave Net now reclaims IP addresses owned by Kubernetes nodes which
have been deleted from the cluster - this avoids running out of IP
addresses when many nodes are added and deleted over a long period.
#2797,#3149,#3170,#3172

##Other improvements

* Export a Prometheus-style metric giving count of unreachable peers #3119
* Update 'gopacket' library to reduce memory use by approx 15MB #3160
* Replace bundling the 'docker' binary with our own code to avoid
  security vulnerability alerts and save space #2957,#3110

##Bug fixes

* When `weave expose` is used, allow traffic into the Weave network -
  up till version 1.12 Docker would do this for us, but in 1.13 they
  stopped so now we do it. This change makes `weave expose` require
  Weave Net to be running. #2758,#3122
* Arm64 build now works on non-kubernetes installs #2832,#3110
* TX offload was being disabled in 'awsvpc' mode, which slows down packet sending #3089
* Removed spurious 'nil' in logs from CNI DEL operation #3143

##Build and test

* Images are now also built for the ppc64le platform #3129
* Tweak build scripts to run on OSX as well as Linux #3135

## Release 2.0.5

Bug fixes

* Fix /etc/hosts inside containers so the container's name resolves to
  its Weave Net address #3136,#3138
* New weave-kube config for Kubernetes 1.7 and 1.8 which resolves an
  intermittent conflict with kube-proxy that could break Weave Net
  until reboot #2998,#3134
* Remove persistence file in `weave reset` when using Docker plugin V2 #3103,#3114

Build and test

* Some trivial changes to placate go-lint #3137

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/61?closed=1).

## Release 2.0.2

Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Fix race condition in weave-npc which would intermittently block all traffic for a namespace #3057,#3059
* Ensure Fast Datapath works on machines that need to mount the kernel module dynamically #3080
* Regression: weave-npc would block everything if `kubelet --hostname-override` was used #3049,#3051
* Fix netfilter rules to block containers from accessing the Weave Net control endpoint #3093
* If DNS server is off then disable proxy DNS registration, to avoid spurious errors #3054,#3088
* Add comments to each iptables rule and ipset, to help when troubleshooting #3064
* Remove code that checked for an outdated fallback address for Kubernetes api-server #3071
* Add a label to the weavedb image so it can be filtered out by tools #3066
* Fix various build and continuous-integration failures #3061
* Print 'help' text faster in the weave script #3056
* Add an option to create continuous integration hosts in different ways #3060
* Remove remnants of the pre-2.0 proxy and plugin from build and test #3035,#3036

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/60?closed=1).

## Release 2.0.1

Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Fall back to slower data path (`sleeve`), rather than crashing, when the machine lacks VXLAN support (required for “fast data path”, `fastdp`) #3043
* Fix bug in processing of arguments when Docker has TLS enabled, rather than crashing with invalid peers list, e.g. `lookup --tlsverify: no such host` #3039
* Add `kube-system` namespace back to `weave-kube`'s YAMLs, preventing omissions leading to errors like `error contacting APIServer: the server does not allow access to the requested resource` #3033,#3042
* Fix release script to prevent ARM64 binaries to end up in AMD64 `net-plugin`, leading to `Error response from daemon: dial unix /run/docker/plugins/<id>/weave.sock: connect: no such file or directory` when installing `net-plugin` #3045
* `weave reset` and `weave rmpeer` now only contact Weave Cloud when Weave Net is configured with a Weave Cloud token, preventing unnecessary requests and potentially confusing `401 Unauthorized` errors in Weave Net’s logs #3044

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/58?closed=1).

## Release 2.0.0

New Features

Peer Discovery via Weave Cloud

You can now get all your Weave Net peers to find each other via the
Weave Cloud service, instead of maintaining a list of peers at
startup. #2799,#2827

See the [docs
page](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/blob/master/site/using-weave/weave-cloud.md)
for more details

New Docker Plugin

Docker has a [new plugin
system](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/) which improves the
installation UX and solves some issues around startup. This means
Weave Net 2.0 can now run with Docker in "swarm mode" and supports the
`docker service` command. #2396,#2397,#2651,#2727,#2805,#2816,#2905,
#2906,#2929,#2932,#2945,#2950,#2956,#2963,#2964,#2966,#3019

The previous Docker Plugin is still available and can be installed as before.

All of Weave Net now runs in one container

Previously we had three separate containers for routing, Docker API
proxy and Docker plugin. Running everything in one simplifies start-up
and removes the need to detect various error
conditions. #1642,#2897,#2936,#2945,#2946,#2951,#2960

The individual commands ‘weave launch-router’, ‘weave launch-plugin’,
etc., have been removed. You can turn off the plugin and proxy with
new command-line options. In keeping with Semantic Versioning, we have
changed the major version number for this release.

Other new features

* Kubernetes configuration now comes from our “Launch Generator” that
  allows different options to be selected via
  URL. #2754,#2903,#3000,#3001
* `weave-kube` now stores data about IP allocation in `/var/lib/weave`
  on the host instead of in a Kubernetes volume. This means that the
  data will persist across pod deletion and re-creation, e.g. during
  an upgrade of Weave Net, which makes restarts more
  reliable. #2610,#2967
* `weave-kube` turned on rolling updates, so careful manual handling
  of updates is no longer required. #3024

Bug fixes

* Kubernetes Network Policies which allowed a specific set of pods to
  connect would block all pods on other hosts. Revert the change in
  v1.9.6 which ignored pods on other hosts #3025,#3028

Features removed

* `weave run` has been removed. This was the original method provided
  to start containers with Weave Net, but it always required care over
  timing of start-up, and we now provide three alternative, better,
  ways. You can replicate the effect by calling `docker run` then
  `weave attach`. Similarly `weave start` and `weave restart` were
  removed. #2353,#2885
* Everything deprecated more than one release ago has been removed, so
  if you use it now you get an error rather than a warning. This
  includes the ‘create-bridge’ command and older command-line
  arguments, e.g. `--iprange` was replaced by `--ipalloc-range`
  #2901,#2909,#2913,#2942,#2989,#2991

Functions moved from shell-script to Go code.

This enables more precise error-checking and runs a bit faster. It has
also enabled us to shrink the size of images downloaded: `weave-kube`
is 101MB compared to 163MB previously #2953,#2954,#2974

Specific items that moved from shell-script to Go:

* Setting up the `weave` bridge #1958,#2975,#2977,#2978
* Container attachment #2947
* Creation of the ’weave’ default plugin network #2920

Minor improvements

* You can now restart the Weave Net router without requiring the proxy to be enabled #2112
* Plugin (legacy version) now respects `--ipalloc-default-subnet` option #2919
* The `weave` script now detects and issues an error message if
  `weave-kube` is running and you attempt to launch again from the script. #2709/#2966
* It is now possible to choose the the MAC address of the `weave`
  bridge using `--name`, in case your hosts have identical unique
  IDs. #2900
* Relaxed Kubernetes tolerations for Weave Net's daemonset in order to
  match any node (previously, only taints directed at master). #3018
* Kubernetes' `seLinuxOptions` configuration is now empty by default,
  to reduce spurious failures on hosts not using seLinux. #3001
* Improved reliability of namespace changes via `nsenter`. #2992
* `weave ps` now fetches the list container IDs internally, rather
  than calling out to `docker ps` #2814,#2898
* at startup, actively remove dead containers’ Weave Net IP addresses from IPAM #3013
* at startup, only check live containers to see if they have an
  existing Weave Net IP address #2815,#2829
* Weave Net CNI plugin now logs but does not raise an error if
  anything goes wrong during network interface delete, to be more
  compatible with Kubernetes 1.6. #2928
* Stop running a shell in “privileged” mode when it’s only writing a file #2838
* New internal REST endpoint to return all IP address mappings. #1350
* Changed the wording where we do not log the password #2833
* Fixed typo in plugin error messages #2894

Build and test

* Weave Net is now built with Go version 1.8, which has better code
  generation and garbage collection #2914
* During smoke-tests, use a webserver instead of just `ping` so we get
  a more realistic test that the Weave network is working #2918
* When installing dependencies for the build container, use a
  keyserver port that's better for firewalls #2812
* Kubernetes test script now scales up to more hosts, and works with
  Kubernetes 1.6 #2837,#2853,#2923
* Other minor build improvements and refactoring #2760,#2910

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/49?closed=1).

## Release 1.9.8

Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Fix weave-npc blocking NodePort and any other non-local access #3011,#3014
* Fix bug where IPAM would duplicate a fixed IP address assigned via Docker plugin #3003,#3010

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/56?closed=1).

## Release 1.9.7

This is identical to 1.9.6 with one additional bug-fix:

* weave-npc would block everything if `kubelet --hostname-override` was used #2995,#2996

## Release 1.9.6

Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Ensure that Kubernetes pods can contact a service implemented within
  the same pod, by turning on "hairpin mode". This is required because
  of a quiet change between Kubernetes 1.5 and 1.6. #2993
* Network Policy Controller (`weave-npc`) now checks local addresses
  only, so it doesn't interfere with cross-cluster traffic. It should
  be more efficient too #2622,#2973,#2979
* Stop reporting back to Kubernetes any issues encountered when
  deleting a pod's network interface. This is required because
  of a quiet change between Kubernetes 1.5 and 1.6. #2921,#2928
* Fixed an issue whereby `weave-npc` couldn't start because one
  `ipset` was referring to another one and could not be destroyed #2915,#2949
* Improved the code which checks whether the kernel supports `ipset` #2934,#2935
* `weave-npc` now creates ipsets with only valid xml characters in the
  name #2958,#2959

Build and Testing

* In build container use cross-compilers from debian package
  repository, so they match other components #2940
* Pin the version of the linting tool `shfmt` so the set of things it
  checks is stable #2987
* Fix lint error in script that runs smoke-tests #2962
* Moved website publishing from Wordpress to Netlify #2986

[Full list of changes](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/milestone/55?closed=1).

## Release 1.9.5

Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Improve log messages generated if "hairpin" conditions are detected,
  to make clear which kind is likely to cause problems #2808/#2926
* Filter out IPv6 peer addresses from Kubernetes; Weave Net currently
  only supports IPv4 #2904/#2912
* Fix rare crash during initialization of weave-kube #2893/#2892
* Include overlay and encryption modes in checkpoint reports, in case
  this is relevant to a version upgrade #2771/#2907

Build and Testing

* Ensure CI build can run gcloud tools #2887
* Prevent kubeadm from upgrading Kubernetes if we are trying to test an older version #2886
* Upgrade build scripts to support Kubernetes 1.6 #2880

More details in the [change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.6.1).

## Release 1.6.0

## Highlights

* A new [AWS VPC](https://weave.works/docs/net/latest/using-weave/awsvpc/) mode
  that leverages Amazon Virtual Private Cloud for near-native network
  performance, as an alternative to the Sleeve and Fast Datapath
  overlays
* Docker 1.12 introduced some internal changes that made it
  incompatible with previous version of Weave Net - this version
  restores compatibility

  detailing best practices for deploying and operating Weave Net
* Changes to the target peer list are remembered across restarts,
  making it much easier to deploy resilient networks
* The version checkpoint now transmits network mode (e.g. 'awsvpc')
  and kernel/docker versions to us to inform and guide our development
  efforts. See the [installation documentation](https://weave.works/docs/net/latest/installing-weave/)
  for instructions on disabling the checkpoint feature.

More details in the [change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.6.0).

## Release 1.5.2

Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Weave Proxy did not flush the initial http header in the Docker event stream, which could cause Docker Swarm to show all nodes pending. #2306/#2311
* When using the CNI plugin, if a container was removed and quickly replaced by another using the same IP address, other containers might be unable to contact it. Send an address resolution protocol message to update them. #2313
* Avoid Docker hanging for 1 minute in `weave launch` if the plugin had not shut down cleanly #2286/#2292
* Print an error message when Weave bridge mode is changed without `weave reset` #2304

* Weave was occasionally unable to claim existing IP address immediately after launch #2275/#2281
* Refactor some integration tests to run faster and more reliably #2291

## Release 1.5.1

Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Persisted data that was rendered invalid by changing peer name or
  allocation range is detected and removed automatically, preventing
  crashes and hangs #2246/#2209/#2249
* `weave rmpeer` persists the range takeover in case the peer on which
  it was executed dies subsequently #2238
* Launching a container with an explicit `WEAVE_CIDR` in the
  allocation range now waits instead of erroring if the allocator
  hasn't finished initialising #2232/#2265
* Weave DNS now responds to AAAA queries with an empty answer section,
  instead of NXDOMAIN which could be cached and block subsequent
  resolution of A records #2244/#2252
* Many improvements to the documentation.

More details in the [change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.5.1).

## Release 1.5.0

## Highlights

* A new [Container Network Interface](https://github.com/appc/cni#cni---the-container-network-interface) plugin.
* This release is much more robust against unscheduled restarts,
  because it persists key data to disk.
* New configuration options that are useful when you create or
  auto-scale larger networks.
* Weave now periodically checks for updates (can be disabled)

Plus many bug fixes and minor enhancements. More details below and in
the [change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.5.0).

## Release 1.4.6

Fixes some issues encountered by our users.

* Restarting a peer could leave stale entries in WeaveDNS
  #1867/#2023/#2081
* Weave proxy occasionally failing to attach any new containers
  #2016/#2049

Other fixes:

* Resolved a crash when a restarting peer re-connected to a peer that
  had not received the latest IPAM data #2083/#2092
* Make IP address space available immediately after a dead peer is
  removed #2068

## Release 1.4.5

Higher performance for multicast and broadcast traffic when using
Weave's Fast Datapath

* The flow rule to deliver broadcast and multicast packets in-kernel
  was not created correctly, hence every such packet caused a
  context-switch to the software router #2003/#2008

Other fixes:

* Remove DNS entries for containers that are being restarted by Docker
  but are not live yet #1977/#1989
* Don't let one failing allocation attempt prevent others from
  succeeding; they could be in different subnets which are more
  available #1996/#2001
* Don't complain on second router launch on kernels that lack support
  for Fast Datapath #1929/#1983
* Fix build broken by change in libnetwork IPAM API #1984/#1985

## Release 1.4.4

Fixing a rather serious issue that slipped through our preparations
for Docker 1.10:

* Restarting Docker or rebooting your machine while the Weave Net
  plugin is running causes Docker 1.10.0 to fail to start #1959/#1963

Also one other small fix:

* Avoid a hang when trying to use plugin and proxy at the same time
  #1956/#1961

## Release 1.4.3

Preparing for Docker 1.10, plus some bug-fixes.

* Avoid hang in Docker v1.10 on `docker volume ls` after `weave stop`,
  `weave stop-plugin` or `weave reset` #1934/#1936
* Fix "unexpected EOF" from Docker 1.10 on `docker exec` with Weave
  proxy `--rewrite-inspect` enabled #1911/#1917
* Avoid losing DNS entries and potentially double-allocating IP
  Addresses allocated via plugin, on router restart; also extend
  `weave ps` to show IP addresses allocated via plugin #1745/#1921
* Stop creating lots of copies of `weavewait` program in Docker
  volumes #1757/#1935
* Prevent container starting prematurely when proxy in
  `--no-multicast-route` mode #1942/#1943
* Log error message from plugin rather than crashing when weave not
  running #1906/#1918
* Warn, don't error, if unable to remove plugin network in 'weave
  stop', to avoid breaking the usual upgrade or config change process
  #1900/#1919
* Don't crash if network conditions suggest only very small packets
  will get through #1905/#1926
* Cope with unexpected errors during route traversal when starting
  container via proxy #1909/#1910/#1932

## Release 1.4.2

Bug-fixes and minor improvements.

* A race condition in weavewait that would occasionally hang
  containers at startup #1882/#1884
* Having the plugin auto-restart prevents successful `weave launch` on
  reboot #1869
* Work round weave router failure on CoreOS 4.3 caused by kernel bug
  #1854
* `weave launch` would exit with error code on docker <1.9 #1851
* Running `eval $(weave env)` multiple times would break `eval $(weave env --restore)` #1824/#1825
* Don't complain in `weave stop` about "Plugin is not running" when
  plugin is not enabled #1840/#1841
* `weave --local launch` would fail if utility program
  `docker_tls_args` could not be found #1844
* Improved error reporting when TLS arg detection fails #1843
* Improve error reporting when docker isn't running #1845
* Add `--trusted-subnets` usage to `weave` script #1842
* weave run can hang under rare combinations of options #1858

## Release 1.4.1

This is a bug-fix release to cover a few issues that came up since the
release of 1.4.0.

* Weave would fail to launch when `$DOCKER_HOST` was set to a TCP socket secured with TLS #1820/#1822
* Weave would fail to stop when run against Docker pre-1.9 #1815/#1817
* Issue a warning instead of failing on `--with-dns` option to proxy, which was removed #1810/#1812
* Make `weave version` show the plugin version #1797/#1813
* Make `weave launch` show when the a container is restarting #1778/#1814
* Make `weave launch` fail if the plugin is running, for consistency with router and proxy. #1818/#1819

More details in the [change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.4.1).

## Release 1.4.0

**Highlights**

* The Docker Network plugin can now operate without a cluster store, so it is now run by default.
* You can now use the fast datapath over trusted links and Weave encryption over untrusted links, in the same network.

Plus many bug fixes and minor enhancements. More details below and in
the [change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.4.0).

## Release 1.3.1

**Highlights**

* The minimum Docker version has been increased to 1.6 due to the
  [upcoming deprecation of Dockerhub access](https://blog.docker.com/2015/10/docker-hub-deprecation-1-5/)
  for old clients. From December 7th onwards previous versions of the
  `weave` script will fail to pull down images from the hub; if you
  are unable to upgrade to 1.3.1 immediately you can work around this
  by running `weave --local setup` in conjunction with a compatible
  Docker client installation
* Docker networking plugin now works with older kernels and allows you
  to configure the MTU

More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.3.1).

## Release 1.3.0

**Highlights**

This release includes a Docker Plugin, so you have the option to use
Weave Net that way. More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.3.0).

## Release 1.2.1

This release contains a number of bug fixes and minor
enhancements. More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.2.1).

The release is fully compatible with 1.2.0 versions, so existing
clusters can be upgraded incrementally.

## Release 1.2.0

**Highlights**

This release introduces the
[Fast Data Path](http://docs.weave.works/weave/master/head/features.html#fast-data-path),
which allows Weave networks to operate at near wire-level speeds. This
new feature is enabled by default.

Other highlights:

* auto-configuration of TLS for the Weave Docker API proxy, making it
  easier to run Weave on Macs and in conjunction with tools like
  Docker Swarm
* support for restart policies on application containers and weave
  infrastructure containers
* better compatibility with recent and future Docker versions

More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.2.0).

## Release 1.1.2

This release contains a small number of bug fixes. More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.2).

The release is fully compatible with 1.1.0 versions, so existing
clusters can be upgraded incrementally. When upgrading from 1.0.x,
note the compatibility information in the
[Installation & Upgrading instructions for Weave 1.1.0](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/tag/v1.1.0).

## Release 1.1.1

This release contains a number of bug fixes and minor
enhancements. More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.1).

The release is fully compatible with 1.1.0 versions, so existing
clusters can be upgraded incrementally. When upgrading from 1.0.x,
note the compatibility information in the
[Installation & Upgrading instructions for Weave 1.1.0](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/tag/v1.1.0).

## Release v1.1.0

**Highlights**:

* `weave launch` now launches all weave components, simplifying
  startup.
* `weave status` has been completely revamped, with a much improved
  presentation of the information, and the option to select and output
  data in JSON.
* weaveDNS has been rewritten and embedded in the router. The new
  implementation simplifies configuration, improves performance, and
  provides fault resilience for services.
* the weave Docker API proxy now provides an even more seamless user
  experience, and enables easier integration of weave with other
  systems such as kubernetes.
* many usability improvements
* a few minor bug fixes, including a couple of security
  vulnerabilities

More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.0).

## Release 1.0.3

This release contains a weaveDNS feature enhancement as well as minor fixes for
improved stability and robustness.

More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.0.3).

The release is fully compatible with other 1.0.x versions, so existing
clusters can be upgraded incrementally.

## Release 1.0.2

This release fixes a number of bugs, including some security
vulnerabilities in the Weave Docker API proxy, hangs and failures in
address allocation, and sporadic failures in name resolution.

More details in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.0.2).

The release is fully compatible with other 1.0.x versions, so existing
clusters can be upgraded incrementally.

## Release 1.0.1

This is a bug fix release, addressing the following issue:

* executing `docker run` from a Docker 1.7 client against the weave
  proxy would report a `no such image` error when the requested image
  wasn't present on the Docker host, instead of downloading it.

## Release 1.0.0

**Highlights**:

* It is now easier than ever to start containers and for them to
  communicate, across multiple hosts. Automatic IP address allocation,
  and name resolution via weaveDNS are now enabled by default, and the
  proxy has become more fully-featured. In short, once weave has been
  launched the following is possible:

  ```
  ````
  host1$ docker run --name=pingme -dti ubuntu
  host2$ docker run -ti ubuntu
  root@d11e9287f65b:/# ping pingme
  ````

  ```
* Containers can now be
  [load-balanced](http://docs.weave.works/weave/latest_release/weavedns.html#load-balancing)
  easily.
* IP address allocation is now available across [multiple
  subnets](http://docs.weave.works/weave/latest_release/ipam.html#range),
  and hence can be employed when running multiple, isolated
  applications.
* The proxy now supports [TLS
  connections](http://docs.weave.works/weave/latest_release/proxy.html#tls),
  enabling its deployment when the communication between docker
  clients and the server must be secured.

There are many other new features, plus the usual assortment of bug
fixes and improvements under the hood. More detail below and in the
[change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A1.0.0).

*NB: This release changes the weave protocol version. Therefore, when
upgrading an existing installation, all hosts need to be upgraded in
order to for them to be able to communicate and form a network.*

## Release 0.11.2

This is a bug fix release, addressing the following issues:

* `weave run` did not respect DOCKER\_CLIENT\_ARGS. #855
* Negative result cache did not expire if requeried within TTL. #845

More details in the [change
log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A0.11.2).

*NB: This release does not change the weave protocol version.
Therefore, when upgrading an existing 0.11 installation incrementally,
connectivity between peers will be retained.*

## Release 0.11.1

This is a bug fix release, addressing the following issues:

* The IP Allocator could crash in some relatively rare
  circumstances. #782/#783.
* When the proxy failed to attach a container to the weave network,
  there was no failure indication and descriptive error anywhere, and
  the application process would still start. Now an error is reported
  to the client (i.e. typically the Docker CLI), recorded in the proxy
  logs, and the container is terminated. #788/#799.
* `weave launch-proxy --with-ipam` failed to configure the entrypoint
  and DNS unless a (possibly blank) `WEAVE_CIDR` was
  specified. Affected containers could start the application process
  w/o the weave network interface being available, and without
  functioning name resolution for the weaveDNS domain.
  #744/#747/#751/#752
* The `weave status` output for the IP Allocator was misleadingly
  conveying a sense of brokenness when no IP allocation requests had
  been made yet. #787/#801
* When invoking `weave launch-proxy` twice, the second invocation
  would output a blank line and terminate with a success exit
  status. Now it reports that the proxy is already running and exits
  with a non-zero status. #767/#780
* `weave launch-proxy` was not respecting WEAVEPROXY\_DOCKER\_ARGS, so
  any user-supplied custom configuration for the weaveproxy container
  was ignored. #755/#780
* The proxy was not intercepting API calls to the unversioned (1.0)
  Docker Remote API. Hence none of the weave functionality was
  available when Docker clients were using that version of the
  API. #770/#774/#777,#809
* The proxy would crash when certain elements of the
  `/containers/create` JSON were missing. We are not aware of any
  Docker clients doing this, but it's been fixed regardless. #778/#777

More details in the [change
log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A0.11.1).

*NB: This release does not change the weave protocol version.
Therefore, when upgrading an existing 0.11 installation incrementally,
connectivity between peers will be retained.*

## Release 0.11.0

**Highlights**:

* **automatic IP Address Management (IPAM)**, which allows application
  containers to be started and attached to the weave network without
  needing to supply an IP address.
* **proxy** for automatically attaching containers started with
  ordinary `docker run`, or the Docker remote API, to the weave
  network.
* ability to **add/remove extra DNS records**.
* performance and scalability improvements
* fixes for a small number of bugs discovered during testing

More detail in the [change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A0.11.0)

*NB: This release changes the weave protocol version. Therefore, when
upgrading an existing installation, all hosts need to be upgraded in
order to for them to be able to communicate and form a network.*

## Release 0.10.0

**Highlights**:

* **bug fixes**, in particular eradicating several deadlocks that could
  cause peer connection failures and hangs.
* **performance and scalability improvements** to the weave control plane,
  as a result of which it is now possible to construct much larger
  weave networks than previously.
* **improved installation and administration**, particularly the
  introduction of remote execution of the weave script in a container,
  permitting fully containerised deployment of weave.
* **improved diagnostics**, such as the reporting of connection failures
  in `weave status`.
* **new weaveDNS features**, most notably the caching of DNS records
  for application containers, which makes finding container IP
  addresses via weaveDNS much faster.

More detail in the [change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A0.10.0)

*NB: This release changes the Weave Docker image names. To upgrade
from an older version, 1) stop all application containers, 2) run
`weave reset` from the old version to remove all traces of weave, and
only then 3) install the new version.*

## Release 0.9.0

* Improve WeaveDNS to the point where it can act as the name server
  for containers in nearly all situations.
* Diagnose and report peer connectivity more comprehensively.
* Adapt to changes in topology - adding & removing of weave peers,
  disruption of connectivity - more rapidly.
* Cope with delays in downloading/running docker images/containers
  required for weave operation.

See the
[complete change log](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/issues?q=milestone%3A0.9.0)
for more details.

## Release 0.8.0

* Align script and image version. When the `weave` script has a
  version number, i.e. it is part of an official release, it runs
  docker images matching that version. Thus the script and image
  versions are automatically aligned. Unversioned/unreleased `weave`
  scripts run the 'latest'-tagged image versions.
* Eliminate dependency on ethtool and conntrack. Instead of requiring
  these to be installed on the host, weave invokes them via a
  `weavetools` docker image that contains minimally packaged versions
  of these utilities.
* New `weave setup` command. This downloads all docker images used by
  weave. Invoking this is strictly optional; its main purpose is to
  facilitate automated installation of weave and preventing delays in
  subsequent weave command execution due to image downloading.

## Release 0.7.0

This is the first release assigned a version number.

When downloading weave you now have the following choices...

1. a specific version, e.g. <https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v0.7.0/weave>
2. latest released version: <https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/latest_release/weave>
3. most recent 'master' commit: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaveworks/weave/master/weave>

Previously the only documented download location was (3). We recommend
that any automated scripts using that be changed to either (1) or (2).

### @bboreham **[bboreham](/bboreham)** commented [Dec 17, 2020](#issue-769989280)

We shouldn't need this for the pod under Kubernetes, because the CNI plugin runs as root on the host.

Still need it for the regular Docker install, where the daemon attaches containers into namespaces.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Weave Net Pods can be used to escalate other Kubernetes vulnerabilities

Moderate

[morancj](/morancj)
published
GHSA-pg3p-v8c6-c6h3
Jan 20, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<=2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.8.0

## Description

### Description

Weave Net is supplied with a manifest that runs pods on every node in a Kubernetes cluster, which are responsible for managing network connections for all other pods in the cluster. This requires a lot of power over the host, and the manifest sets `privileged: true`, which gives it that power. It also set `hostPID: true`, which gave it the ability to access all other processes on the host and write anywhere in the root filesystem of the host, and mounted some host volumes which indirectly gave it the same access.

### Impact

For vulnerable installs, the attacker can take over any host in the cluster.

### Am I vulnerable?

Only if you have an additional vulnerability (e.g. a bug in Kubernetes) or misconfiguration that allows an attacker to run code inside the Weave Net pod,

No such bug is known at the time of release, and there are no known instances of this being exploited.

### Patches

Weave Net 2.8.0 removes the `hostPID` setting and moves CNI plugin install to an init container.

Even after removing the `hostPID` setting, the container still had the ability to write over the CNI plugin, which is executed as root with full access to the host by the runtime (e.g. Dockershim, CRI-O, ContainerD) every time a pod is added or deleted. The volume mounts which gave that access have been moved to an init container to mitigate the risk - now, getting inside the init container requires that an attacker have the ability to delete pods or reboot the machine.

Note that an attacker inside the Weave Net pod can still be highly disruptive - breaking network communications, etc. - so it is essential to have access controls (e.g. the RBAC rules supplied in this repo) and other measures to prevent attackers from getting inside.

### Workarounds

Users who do not update to 2.8.0 can edit the `hostPID` line in their existing DaemonSet manifest to say `false` instead of `true`,

arrange some other way to install CNI plugins (e.g. Ansible) and remove those mounts from the DaemonSet manifest.

### References

For more information on init containers visit [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/)

### Credit

We would like to thank "Mobydick" for reporting the Host PID issue.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.
