Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities discovered in the virtual event platforms, specifically webcasts.com (and its integrated customer 6Connex) and VFairs:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **webcasts.com/6Connex:**
    *   **Weakness:** Information disclosure/PII leakage.
    *   **Root Cause:**  Attendees could access a data dump of all users participating in a virtual conference through attendee IDs.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of personal information, including names, company/title, email addresses, IP addresses, and potentially city, state, phone number and physical addresses. This data was accessible to any other attendee, not just presenters.
    *  **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting the attendee ID system.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  Normal access as an attendee at an event using the platform.

2.  **VFairs (version 3.33):**
    *   **Weakness:** Profile manipulation, cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution (RCE), SQL injection.
    *   **Root Cause:**
        *   **Profile Manipulation:** Attendees could modify the profiles of other attendees by manipulating ID numbers.
        *   **XSS:** The ability to edit profiles could be exploited for XSS attacks, enabling the theft of cookies, impersonation of users, or browser redirection.
        *   **RCE:** The profile picture upload feature allowed uploading of PHP code, enabling remote code execution.
        *   **SQL Injection:** Public SQL database errors and a time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability gave attackers direct access to the database.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Profile Manipulation:** Impersonation, defacement of profiles.
        *  **XSS:** User session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft.
        *   **RCE:** Full control of the server/website, leading to potential data breaches or further malicious activities.
        *    **SQL Injection**: Full access and control over the database, allowing for data extraction or modification.
    *  **Attack Vector:**
        *   Profile manipulation via ID manipulation
        *   Uploading malicious files through profile picture functionality
        *   Exploiting public SQL errors and the time based blind SQL injection vulnerability
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Normal access as an attendee at an event using the platform.

**Additional points:**

*   **Supply Chain Attacks:** The article highlights a large SMB supply chain breach involving Axial, where sensitive information related to mergers and acquisitions was leaked due to neglected security measures.
*   **Vendor Accountability:** The article emphasizes the importance of vetting third-party solutions for security before adopting them.
*   **Patching:**  VFairs version 3.34 patched the noted vulnerabilities. Both VFairs and 6Connex were notified and have since addressed the vulnerabilities.
*   **Discovery:** Huntress discovered these vulnerabilities while participating as attendees at events using the vulnerable platforms.

**In summary:** The vulnerabilities in these virtual event platforms demonstrate that seemingly harmless systems can harbor serious security flaws leading to significant data breaches and system compromise. They highlight the potential impact of supply chain attacks and the need for strong vendor security practices.

**CVE Relevance:** While the article details significant vulnerabilities, it doesn't directly reference CVE-2020-26678 or otherwise confirm that the vulnerabilities described are related to this CVE. Therefore, a more specific correlation is not possible based on the provided content.
