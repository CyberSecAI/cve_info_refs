The content is related to a post-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting certain NETGEAR routers.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Post-authentication command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability that can be exploited after successful authentication to the router's web interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router. While the advisory doesn't explicitly detail the impact, command injection typically allows for complete control of the device, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, denial of service, or using the router as part of a botnet.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the router's web interface. An attacker needs to authenticate to access the vulnerable functionality and inject malicious commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the router's web interface. This implies an attacker may be a user with legitimate access or have obtained access through other means.

The advisory also mentions:
- **Affected Products**: R6220 and R6230 with firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.100
- **CVSS Score**: 7.3 (High)
- **CVSS Vector**: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
- **Acknowledgement**: Joel St. John is acknowledged for reporting the vulnerability.
- **Mitigation**: Update to the latest firmware version.
