Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2020-26832:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a missing authorization check within the SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP and SAP S4 HANA (SAP Landscape Transformation) system. Specifically, the function module `CNV_GET_USERS_FOR_APP_SERVER` in the function group `CNV_00001_HELP` does not implement any programmatic authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access to the function module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve internal information about active logon sessions on the SAP system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can terminate all active logon sessions, effectively locking out legitimate users and making the system unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Function Call (RFC):** The vulnerability is exploited by invoking the function module remotely via the RFC protocol. This means an attacker can potentially exploit this from a network-connected location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the SAP system to make RFC calls to the vulnerable function module.
- **SAP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be aware of the function module name `CNV_GET_USERS_FOR_APP_SERVER` and the parameters to invoke it successfully via RFC.
