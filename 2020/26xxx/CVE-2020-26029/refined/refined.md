{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application performs authorization checks based on the actual user making the request instead of the user specified in the `X-On-Behalf-Of` header during impersonation requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper authorization checks during impersonation requests, allowing unauthorized access to information.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain access to information without proper authentication checks by impersonating other users via the `X-On-Behalf-Of` header.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending an HTTP request with the `X-On-Behalf-Of` header set to a target user.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authorized user of the Zammad system."
