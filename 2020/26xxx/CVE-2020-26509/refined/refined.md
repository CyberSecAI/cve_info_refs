    "Exposed Tomcat Server Manager: The Tomcat Manager is reachable at `httpx:///manager/html` by default.",
    "Weak default credentials for Tomcat Manager: Tomcat Manager uses 'airleader'/'airleader' as default credentials."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the devices' web interface and Tomcat manager, potentially leading to monitoring and control of the devices and other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network access to the web interface and the Tomcat manager.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker requires network access to the vulnerable devices."
