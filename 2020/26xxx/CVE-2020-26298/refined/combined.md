## Detailed Description

Ruby 3.2 is upstream's new major release of Ruby. Many new features and improvements are included.

### Production-ready YJIT

* YJIT is no longer experimental
  + Has been tested on production workloads for over a year and proven to be quite stable.
* The YJIT 3.2 release is faster than 3.1, and has about 1/3 as much memory overhead.
  + Overall YJIT is 41% faster (geometric mean) than the Ruby interpreter on [yjit-bench](https://github.com/Shopify/yjit-bench).
  + Physical memory for JIT code is lazily allocated.
  + Introduce Code GC that frees all code pages when the memory consumption by JIT code reaches `--yjit-exec-mem-size`.
  + `RubyVM::YJIT.runtime_stats` returns Code GC metrics in addition to existing `inline_code_size` and `outlined_code_size` keys: `code_gc_count`, `live_page_count`, `freed_page_count`, and `freed_code_size`.
* Most of the statistics produced by `RubyVM::YJIT.runtime_stats` are now available in release builds.
  + Simply run ruby with `--yjit-stats` to compute and dump stats (incurs some run-time overhead).
* YJIT is now optimized to take advantage of object shapes.
* Take advantage of finer-grained constant invalidation to invalidate less code when defining new constants.

### Regexp improvements against ReDoS

It is known that Regexp matching may take unexpectedly long. If your code attempts to match a possibly inefficient Regexp against an untrusted input, an attacker may exploit it for efficient Denial of Service (so-called Regular expression DoS, or ReDoS).

Ruby 3.2 introduces two improvements that significantly mitigate ReDoS.

#### Improved Regexp matching algorithm

Since Ruby 3.2, Regexp's matching algorithm has been greatly improved by using a memoization technique.

The improved matching algorithm allows most Regexp matching (about 90% in our experiments) to be completed in linear time.

This optimization may consume memory proportional to the input length for each match. No practical problems are expected to arise because this memory allocation is usually delayed, and a normal Regexp match should consume at most 10 times as much memory as the input length.

#### Regexp timeout

The optimization above cannot be applied to some kind of regular expressions, such as those including advanced features (e.g., back-references or look-around), or with a huge fixed number of repetitions. As a fallback measure, a timeout feature for Regexp matches is also introduced.

Note that `Regexp.timeout` is a global configuration. If you want to use different timeout settings for some special Regexps, you may want to use the `timeout` keyword for `Regexp.new`.

### Other Notable New Features

* Language
  + Anonymous rest and keyword rest arguments can now be passed as arguments, instead of just used in method parameters.
  + A proc that accepts a single positional argument and keywords will no longer autosplat.
  + Constant assignment evaluation order for constants set on explicit objects has been made consistent with single attribute assignment evaluation order.
  + Find pattern is no longer experimental.
  + Methods taking a rest parameter and wishing to delegate keyword arguments through `foo(*args)` must now be marked with `ruby2_keywords`
* Performance improvements
  + YJIT
    - Support arm64 / aarch64 on UNIX platforms.
    - Building YJIT requires Rust 1.58.1+.

### Other notable changes since 3.1

* Data
  + New core class to represent simple immutable value object. The class is similar to Struct and partially shares an implementation, but has more lean and strict API.
* Hash
  + Hash#shift now always returns nil if the hash is empty, instead of returning the default value or calling the default proc.
* MatchData
  + MatchData#byteoffset has been added.
* Module
  + Module.used\_refinements has been added.
  + Module#refinements has been added.
  + Module#const\_added has been added.
* Proc
  + Proc#dup returns an instance of subclass.
  + Proc#parameters now accepts lambda keyword.
* Refinement
  + Refinement#refined\_class has been added.
* Set
  + Set is now available as a builtin class without the need for `require "set"`. It is currently autoloaded via the `Set` constant or a call to `Enumerable#to_set`.
* String
  + String#byteindex and String#byterindex have been added.
  + Update Unicode to Version 14.0.0 and Emoji Version 14.0. (also applies to Regexp)
  + String#bytesplice has been added.
* Struct
  + A Struct class can also be initialized with keyword arguments without `keyword_init: true` on `Struct.new`

### Compatibility issues

* Removed constants
  + `Fixnum` and `Bignum`
  + `Random::DEFAULT`
  + `Struct::Group`
  + `Struct::Passwd`
* Removed methods
  + `Dir.exists?`
  + `File.exists?`
  + `Kernel#=~`
  + `Kernel#taint`, `Kernel#untaint`, `Kernel#tainted?`
  + `Kernel#trust`, `Kernel#untrust`, `Kernel#untrusted?`

### C API updates

* Removed C APIs
  + `rb_cData` variable.
  + "taintedness" and "trustedness" functions.

## Feedback

## Benefit to Fedora

With a latest release, Ruby language is supporting the newest language features, which enables even faster and easier development of Ruby applications.

## Scope

* Proposal owners:
  + Finish packaging of Ruby 3.2. Current changes available in PR <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/ruby/pull-request/134>
  + Rebuilding of Ruby packages providing native extensions (i.e. packages which depends on libruby).

* Other developers:
  + Rebuild of packages with binary extensions (i.e. packages which depends on libruby) will be handled automatically, but some packages might need fixes/updates to support Ruby 3.2 properly.

* Release engineering: [#11115](https://pagure.io/releng/issues/11115)
  + The packages are going to be rebuild in side-tag, but that does not need releng involvement nowadays.

* Policies and guidelines: N/A (not needed for this Change)

* Trademark approval: N/A (not needed for this Change)

* Alignment with Objectives:

## Upgrade/compatibility impact

* User specific Ruby binary extensions need to be rebuild.
* Ruby packages/application dependencies might need to be adjusted if newly bundled gems are used.

## How To Test

* No special hardware is needed.
* To test, install Ruby 3.2. The test builds are published in PR or on Ruby-SIG ML
* Try to locally rebuild your packages using Ruby 3.2.
* Use the packages with your applications previously written in Ruby.
* If something doesn't work as it should, let us know.

## User Experience

The Ruby programs/scripts should behave as they were used to.

## Dependencies

```
$ dnf repoquery --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=rawhide --enablerepo=rawhide-source --arch=src --whatrequires 'ruby-devel' | sort | uniq | wc -l
130

```
## Contingency Plan

* Contingency mechanism: We would like to get a special buildroot tag to be able to rebuild necessary the packages with Ruby 3.2. If anything goes wrong, the tag could be easily dropped and previous version of Ruby 3.1 and its dependencies stays intact. The tag would be merged into F38 after everything is rebuild.
* Contingency deadline: Mass Rebuild
* Blocks release? No

## Documentation

* [Help and documentation for the Ruby programming language](http://www.ruby-doc.org/)
* [Ruby 3.2.0 NEWS](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/ruby_3_2/NEWS.md)
* [Ruby 3.2 release announcement](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2022/12/25/ruby-3-2-0-released/)

## Release Notes

* The Ruby 3.2 bumps soname, therefore Ruby packages, which use binary extensions, should be rebuilt. Nevertheless, since upstream paid great attention to source compatibility, no changes to your code are needed.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Redcarpet is a Ruby library for Markdown processing that smells like
butterflies and popcorn.

## This library is written by people

Redcarpet was written by [Vicent Martí](https://github.com/vmg). It is maintained by
[Robin Dupret](https://github.com/robin850) and [Matt Rogers](https://github.com/mattr-).

Redcarpet would not be possible without the [Sundown](https://www.github.com/vmg/sundown)
library and its authors (Natacha Porté, Vicent Martí, and its many awesome contributors).

## You can totally install it as a Gem

Redcarpet is readily available as a Ruby gem. It will build some native
extensions, but the parser is standalone and requires no installed libraries.
Starting with Redcarpet 3.0, the minimum required Ruby version is 1.9.2 (or Rubinius in 1.9 mode).

```
$ [sudo] gem install redcarpet

```

If you need to use it with Ruby 1.8.7, you will have to stick with 2.3.0:

```
$ [sudo] gem install redcarpet -v 2.3.0

```

The Redcarpet source is available at GitHub:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/vmg/redcarpet.git

```

## And it's like *really* simple to use

The core of the Redcarpet library is the `Redcarpet::Markdown` class. Each
instance of the class is attached to a `Renderer` object; the Markdown class
performs parsing of a document and uses the attached renderer to generate
output.

The `Redcarpet::Markdown` object is encouraged to be instantiated once with the
required settings, and reused between parses.

```
# Initializes a Markdown parser
markdown = Redcarpet::Markdown.new(renderer, extensions = {})
```

Here, the `renderer` variable refers to a renderer object, inheriting
from `Redcarpet::Render::Base`. If the given object has not been
instantiated, the library will do it with default arguments.

Rendering with the `Markdown` object is done through `Markdown#render`.
Unlike in the RedCloth API, the text to render is passed as an argument
and not stored inside the `Markdown` instance, to encourage reusability.
Example:

```
markdown.render("This is *bongos*, indeed.")
# => "<p>This is <em>bongos</em>, indeed.</p>"
```

You can also specify a hash containing the Markdown extensions which the
parser will identify. The following extensions are accepted:

* `:no_intra_emphasis`: do not parse emphasis inside of words.
  Strings such as `foo_bar_baz` will not generate `<em>` tags.
* `:tables`: parse tables, PHP-Markdown style.
* `:fenced_code_blocks`: parse fenced code blocks, PHP-Markdown
  style. Blocks delimited with 3 or more `~` or backticks will be considered
  as code, without the need to be indented. An optional language name may
  be added at the end of the opening fence for the code block.
* `:autolink`: parse links even when they are not enclosed in `<>`
  characters. Autolinks for the http, https and ftp protocols will be
  automatically detected. Email addresses and http links without protocol,
  but starting with `www` are also handled.
* `:disable_indented_code_blocks`: do not parse usual markdown
  code blocks. Markdown converts text with four spaces at
  the front of each line to code blocks. This option
  prevents it from doing so. Recommended to use
  with `fenced_code_blocks: true`.
* `:strikethrough`: parse strikethrough, PHP-Markdown style.
  Two `~` characters mark the start of a strikethrough,
  e.g. `this is ~~good~~ bad`.
* `:lax_spacing`: HTML blocks do not require to be surrounded by an
  empty line as in the Markdown standard.
* `:space_after_headers`: A space is always required between the hash
  at the beginning of a header and its name, e.g. `#this is my header`
  would not be a valid header.
* `:superscript`: parse superscripts after the `^` character; contiguous superscripts
  are nested together, and complex values can be enclosed in parenthesis, e.g.
  `this is the 2^(nd) time`.
* `:underline`: parse underscored emphasis as underlines.
  `This is _underlined_ but this is still *italic*`.
* `:highlight`: parse highlights.
  `This is ==highlighted==`. It looks like this: `<mark>highlighted</mark>`
* `:quote`: parse quotes.
  `This is a "quote"`. It looks like this: `<q>quote</q>`
* `:footnotes`: parse footnotes, PHP-Markdown style. A footnote works very much
  like a reference-style link: it consists of a marker next to the text (e.g.
  `This is a sentence.[^1]`) and a footnote definition on its own line anywhere
  within the document (e.g. `[^1]: This is a footnote.`).

Example:

```
markdown = Redcarpet::Markdown.new(Redcarpet::Render::HTML, autolink: true, tables: true)
```

## Darling, I packed you a couple renderers for lunch

Redcarpet comes with two built-in renderers, `Redcarpet::Render::HTML` and
`Redcarpet::Render::XHTML`, which output HTML and XHTML, respectively. These
renderers are actually implemented in C and hence offer brilliant
performance — several degrees of magnitude faster than other Ruby Markdown
solutions.

All the rendering flags that previously applied only to HTML output have
now been moved to the `Redcarpet::Render::HTML` class, and may be enabled when
instantiating the renderer:

```
Redcarpet::Render::HTML.new(render_options = {})
```

Initializes an HTML renderer. The following flags are available:

* `:filter_html`: do not allow any user-inputted HTML in the output.
* `:no_images`: do not generate any `<img>` tags.
* `:no_links`: do not generate any `<a>` tags.
* `:no_styles`: do not generate any `<style>` tags.
* `:escape_html`: escape any HTML tags. This option has precedence over
  `:no_styles`, `:no_links`, `:no_images` and `:filter_html` which means
  that any existing tag will be escaped instead of being removed.
* `:safe_links_only`: only generate links for protocols which are considered
  safe.
* `:with_toc_data`: add HTML anchors to each header in the output HTML,
  to allow linking to each section.
* `:hard_wrap`: insert HTML `<br>` tags inside paragraphs where the original
  Markdown document had newlines (by default, Markdown ignores these newlines).
* `:xhtml`: output XHTML-conformant tags. This option is always enabled in the
  `Render::XHTML` renderer.
* `:prettify`: add prettyprint classes to `<code>` tags for google-code-prettify.
* `:link_attributes`: hash of extra attributes to add to links.

Example:

```
renderer = Redcarpet::Render::HTML.new(no_links: true, hard_wrap: true)
```

The `HTML` renderer has an alternate version, `Redcarpet::Render::HTML_TOC`,
which will output a table of contents in HTML based on the headers of the
Markdown document.

When instantiating this render object, you can optionally pass a `nesting_level`
option which takes an integer or a range and allows you to make it render only
headers at certain levels.

Redcarpet also includes a plaintext renderer, `Redcarpet::Render::StripDown`, that
strips out all the formatting:

```
require 'redcarpet'
require 'redcarpet/render_strip'

markdown = Redcarpet::Markdown.new(Redcarpet::Render::StripDown)

markdown.render("**This** _is_ an [example](http://example.org/).")
# => "This is an example (http://example.org/)."
```

## And you can even cook your own

Custom renderers are created by inheriting from an existing renderer. The
built-in renderers, `HTML` and `XHTML` may be extended as such:

```
# Create a custom renderer that sets a custom class for block-quotes.
class CustomRender < Redcarpet::Render::HTML
  def block_quote(quote)
    %(<blockquote class="my-custom-class">#{quote}</blockquote>)
  end
end

markdown = Redcarpet::Markdown.new(CustomRender, fenced_code_blocks: true)
```

But new renderers can also be created from scratch by extending the abstract
base class `Redcarpet::Render::Base` (see `lib/redcarpet/render_man.rb` for
an example implementation of a Manpage renderer):

```
class ManPage < Redcarpet::Render::Base
  # you get the drill -- keep going from here
end
```

The following instance methods may be implemented by the renderer:

### Block-level calls

If the return value of the method is `nil`, the block will be skipped.
Therefore, make sure that your renderer has at least a `paragraph` method
implemented. If the method for a document element is not implemented, the
block will be skipped.

Example:

```
class RenderWithoutCode < Redcarpet::Render::HTML
  def block_code(code, language)
    nil
  end
end
```

* block\_code(code, language)
* block\_quote(quote)
* block\_html(raw\_html)
* footnotes(content)
* footnote\_def(content, number)
* header(text, header\_level)
* hrule()
* list(contents, list\_type)
* list\_item(text, list\_type)
* paragraph(text)
* table(header, body)
* table\_row(content)
* table\_cell(content, alignment, header)

### Span-level calls

A return value of `nil` will not output any data. If the method for
a document element is not implemented, the contents of the span will
be copied verbatim:

* autolink(link, link\_type)
* codespan(code)
* double\_emphasis(text)
* emphasis(text)
* image(link, title, alt\_text)
* linebreak()
* link(link, title, content)
* raw\_html(raw\_html)
* triple\_emphasis(text)
* strikethrough(text)
* superscript(text)
* underline(text)
* highlight(text)
* quote(text)
* footnote\_ref(number)

**Note**: When overriding a renderer's method, be sure to return a HTML
element with a level that matches the level of that method (e.g. return a
block element when overriding a block-level callback). Otherwise, the output
may be unexpected.

### Low level rendering

* entity(text)
* normal\_text(text)

### Header of the document

Rendered before any another elements:

* doc\_header()

### Footer of the document

Rendered after all the other elements:

* doc\_footer()

### Pre/post-process

Special callback: preprocess or postprocess the whole document before
or after the rendering process begins:

* preprocess(full\_document)
* postprocess(full\_document)

You can look at
["How to extend the Redcarpet 2 Markdown library?"](https://web.archive.org/web/20170505231254/http%3A//dev.af83.com/2012/02/27/howto-extend-the-redcarpet2-markdown-lib.html)
for some more explanations.

## Also, now our Pants are much smarter

Redcarpet 2 comes with a standalone [SmartyPants](http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) implementation. It is fully
compliant with the original implementation. It is the fastest SmartyPants
parser there is, with a difference of several orders of magnitude.

The SmartyPants parser can be found in `Redcarpet::Render::SmartyPants`. It has
been implemented as a module, so it can be used standalone or as a mixin.

When mixed with a Renderer class, it will override the `postprocess` method
to perform SmartyPants replacements once the rendering is complete.

```
# Mixin
class HTMLWithPants < Redcarpet::Render::HTML
  include Redcarpet::Render::SmartyPants
end

# Standalone
Redcarpet::Render::SmartyPants.render("<p>Oh SmartyPants, you're so crazy...</p>")
```

SmartyPants works on top of already-rendered HTML, and will ignore replacements
inside the content of HTML tags and inside specific HTML blocks (`pre`, `code`,
`var`, `samp`, `kbd`, `math`, `script`, `style`).

## What? You really want to mix Markdown renderers?

Redcarpet used to be a drop-in replacement for Redcloth. This is no longer the
case since version 2 -- it now has its own API, but retains the old name. Yes,
that does mean that Redcarpet is not backwards-compatible with the 1.X
versions.

Each renderer has its own API and its own set of extensions: you should choose one
(it doesn't have to be Redcarpet, though that would be great!), write your
software accordingly, and force your users to install it. That's the
only way to have reliable and predictable Markdown output on your program.

Markdown is already ill-specified enough; if you create software that is
renderer-independent, the results will be completely unreliable!

Still, if major forces (let's say, tornadoes or other natural disasters) force you
to keep a Markdown-compatibility layer, Redcarpet also supports this:

```
require 'redcarpet/compat'
```

Requiring the compatibility library will declare a `Markdown` class with the
classical RedCloth API, e.g.

```
Markdown.new('this is my text').to_html
```

This class renders 100% standards compliant Markdown with 0 extensions. Nada.
Don't even try to enable extensions with a compatibility layer, because
that's a maintenance nightmare and won't work.

On a related topic: if your Markdown gem has a `lib/markdown.rb` file that
monkeypatches the Markdown class, you're a terrible human being. Just saying.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 37 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [F37Boost178](/wiki/Changes/F37Boost178 "Changes/F37Boost178")
* [F37MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F37MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F37MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [Python3.11](/wiki/Changes/Python3.11 "Changes/Python3.11")

## Before the rebuild

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 20th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f37
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to the next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to the next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f37. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f37 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f37
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages are currently built from the source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-01-19 15:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Plans & Pricing

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## Description

Redcarpet is a Ruby library for Markdown processing. In Redcarpet before version 3.5.1, there is an injection vulnerability which can enable a cross-site scripting attack. In affected versions no HTML escaping was being performed when processing quotes. This applies even when the `:escape_html` option was being used. This is fixed in version 3.5.1 by the referenced commit.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 38 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [Add FORTIFY\_SOURCE=3](/wiki/Changes/Add_FORTIFY_SOURCE%3D3_to_distribution_build_flags "Changes/Add FORTIFY SOURCE=3 to distribution build flags")
* [fno-omit-frame-pointer](/wiki/Changes/fno-omit-frame-pointer "Changes/fno-omit-frame-pointer")
* [Perl replace MODULE\_COMPAT by generator](/wiki/Changes/Perl_replace_MODULE_COMPAT_by_generator "Changes/Perl replace MODULE COMPAT by generator")

## Before the rebuild

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, January 18th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f38
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to the next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to the next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f38. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f38 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f38
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages are currently built from the source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-01-19 15:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on Libera.CHAT IRC.

Package        : ruby-redcarpet
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-26298
Debian Bug     : 980057

Johan Smits discovered that ruby-redcarpet, a markdown parser, did not
properly validate its input. This would allow an attacker to mount a
cross-site scripting attack.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.0-4+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-redcarpet packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-redcarpet please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-redcarpet>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Managing disruptive comments

You can hide, edit, or delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

## [Hiding a comment](#hiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can hide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

If a comment is off-topic, outdated, or resolved, you may want to hide a comment to keep a discussion focused or make a pull request easier to navigate and review. Hidden comments are minimized but people with read access to the repository can expand them.

![Screenshot of a hidden comment. The only visible content is "This comment has been minimized", with a button to show the comment.](/assets/cb-13766/images/help/repository/hidden-comment.png)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to hide.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Hide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Hide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42438/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hide.png)
3. Using the "Choose a reason" dropdown menu, choose a reason to hide the comment. Then select **Hide comment**.

   ![Screenshot of a comment showing a menu to select a reason to hide the comment: Spam, Abuse, Off Topic, Outdated, Duplicate, or Resolved.](/assets/cb-67538/images/help/repository/choose-reason-for-hiding-comment.png)

## [Unhiding a comment](#unhiding-a-comment)

Organization moderators, and anyone with write access to a repository, can unhide comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to unhide.
2. On the right side of the comment, click  **Show comment**.
3. On the right side of the expanded comment, select the  dropdown menu, then click **Unhide**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment marked as spam. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Unhide" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-50118/images/help/repository/comment-menu-hidden.png)

## [Editing a comment](#editing-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can edit comments on issues, pull requests, and commits.

It's appropriate to edit a comment and remove content that doesn't contribute to the conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Sometimes it may make sense to clearly indicate edits and their justification.

That said, anyone with read access to a repository can view a comment's edit history. The **edited** dropdown at the top of the comment contains a history of edits showing the user and timestamp for each edit.

![Screenshot of a comment by octo-user, which is partially redacted. In the header, next to "edited by octocat", a dropdown icon is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42069/images/help/repository/content-redacted-comment.png)

## [Redacting sensitive information](#redacting-sensitive-information)

Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can also delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history. For more information, see [Tracking changes in a comment](/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment).

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to edit.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Edit**.

   ![Screenshot of a pull request comment by octo-user. Below an icon of three dots, a dropdown menu is expanded, and "Edit" is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-42473/images/help/repository/comment-menu-edit.png)
3. In the comment window, delete the content you'd like to remove, then type `[REDACTED]` to replace it.
4. At the bottom of the comment, type a note indicating that you have edited the comment, and optionally, why you edited the comment.
5. Click **Update comment**.

## [Deleting a comment](#deleting-a-comment)

Anyone with write access to a repository can delete comments on issues, pull requests, and commits. Organization owners, team maintainers, and the comment author can also delete a comment on a team page.

If a comment contains some constructive content that adds to the conversation in the issue or pull request, you can edit the comment instead.

Deleting a comment is your last resort as a moderator. It's appropriate to delete a comment if the entire comment adds no constructive content to a conversation and violates your community's code of conduct or GitHub's [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

Deleting a comment creates a timeline event that is visible to anyone with read access to the repository. However, the username of the person who deleted the comment is only visible to people with write access to the repository. For anyone without write access, the timeline event is anonymized.

Note

The initial comment (or body) of an issue or pull request can't be deleted. Instead, you can edit issue and pull request bodies to remove unwanted content.

### [Steps to delete a comment](#steps-to-delete-a-comment)

1. Navigate to the comment you'd like to delete.
2. In the upper-right corner of the comment, click , then click **Delete**.

Package        : ruby-redcarpet
Version        : 3.3.4-2+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-26298
Debian Bug     : 980057

In Redcarpet before version 3.5.1, there is an injection
vulnerability which can enable a cross-site scripting attack.

In affected versions, no HTML escaping was being performed when
processing quotes. This applies even when the `:escape_html`
option was being used.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
3.3.4-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-redcarpet packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-redcarpet please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-redcarpet>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1915371#c0)  Michael Kaplan    2021-01-12 14:23:28 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1915371#c1)  Michael Kaplan    2021-01-12 14:23:31 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # low, medium, high, urgent (required) severity=medium  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1915370,1915371  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1915371#c2)  Ben Cotton    2021-11-04 16:20:31 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 33 is nearing its end of life. Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 33 on 2021-11-30. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '33'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 33 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1915371#c3)  Ben Cotton    2021-11-30 17:40:35 UTC  ``` Fedora 33 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2021-11-30. Fedora 33 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this bug.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1915371#c4)  Fedora Update System    2023-04-30 12:00:42 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2023-44daa9c1d4 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 38. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-44daa9c1d4>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1915371#c5)  Fedora Update System    2023-04-30 12:00:55 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2023-8682a0e17d has been submitted as an update to Fedora 37. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-8682a0e17d>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1915371#c6)  Fedora Update System    2023-04-30 12:01:12 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2023-597f13ffb9 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 36. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-597f13ffb9>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1915371#c7)  Fedora Update System    2023-05-01 01:31:55 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2023-8682a0e17d has been pushed to the Fedora 37 testing repository.

# Changelog

## Version 3.6.0

* Avoid warnings running on Ruby 3.2+.

  Refs #721.

  *Jean Boussier*
* Match fence char and length when matching closing fence in fenced code blocks.

  Fixes #208.

  *Martin Cizek, Orchitech*
* Consider `<center>` as a block-level element.

  Refs #702.

  *momijizukamori*
* Properly provide a third argument to the `table_cell` callback indicating
  whether the current cell is part of the header or not.

  The previous implementation with two parameters is still supported.

  Fixes #604, Refs #605.

  *Mark Lambley*
* Fix anchor generation on titles with ampersands.

  Fixes #696.

## Version 3.5.1 (Security)

* Fix a security vulnerability using `:quote` in combination with the
  `:escape_html` option.

  Reported by *Johan Smits*.

## Version 3.5.0

* Avoid mutating the options hash passed to a render object.

  Refs #663.

  *Max Schwenk*
* Fix a segfault rendering quotes using `StripDown` and the `:quote`
  option.

  Fixes #639.
* Fix `warning: instance variable @options not initialized` when
  running under verbose mode (`-w`, `$VERBOSE = true`).
* Fix SmartyPants single quotes right after a link. For example:

  ```
  [John](http://john.doe)'s cat
  ```

  Will now properly converts `'` to a right single quote (i.e. `’`).

  Fixes #624.
* Remove the `rel` and `rev` attributes from the output generated
  for footnotes as they don't pass the HTML 5 validation.

  Fixes #536.
* Automatically enable the `fenced_code_blocks` option passing a
  `HTML_TOC` object to the `Markdown` object's constructor since
  some languages rely on the sharp to comment code.

  Fixes #451.
* Allow passing `Range` objects to the `nesting_level` option to have
  a higher level of customization for table of contents:

  ```
  Redcarpet::Render::HTML_TOC.new(nesting_level: 2..5)
  ```

  Fixes #519.

## Version 3.4.0

* Rely on djb2 hashing generating anchors with non-ASCII chars.

  Fix issue [#538](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/538).

  *Alexey Kopytko*, *namusyaka*
* Added suppport for HTML 5 `details` and `summary` tags.

  Fix issue [#578](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/578).

  *James Edwards-Jones*
* Multiple single quote pairs are parsed correctly with SmartyPants.

  Fix issue [#549](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/549).

  *Jan Jędrychowski*
* Table headers don't require a minimum of three dashes anymore; a
  single one can be used for each row.
* Remove escaped entities from `HTML` render table of contents'
  ids to be consistent with the `HTML_TOC` render.

  Fix issue [#529](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/529).
* Remove periods at the end of URLs when autolinking to make sure
  that links at the end of a sentence get properly generated.

  Fix issue [#465](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/465).
* Expose the Markdown and rendering options through a `Hash` inside
  the `@options` instance variable for custom render objects.
* Avoid escaping ampersands in href links.

  *Nolan Evans*

## Version 3.3.4

* Fix `bufprintf` to correctly work on Windows MinGW-w64 so strings
  are properly written to the buffer.

  *Kenichi Saita*
* Fix the header anchor normalization by skipping non-ASCII chars
  and not calling tolower because this leads to invalid UTF-8 byte
  sequences in the HTML output. (tolower is not locale-aware)

  *Clemens Gruber*

## Version 3.3.3

* Fix a memory leak instantiating a `Redcarpet::Render::Base` object.

  *Oleg Dashevskii*
* Fix the `StripDown` renderer to handle the `:highlight` option.

  *Itay Grudev*

  numbers separated with slashes (e.g. for a date).

  *Sam Saffron*

## Version 3.3.2

* Fix a potential security issue in the HTML renderer
  (Thanks to Giancarlo Canales Barreto for the heads up)

## Version 3.3.1

* Include the `Redcarpet::CLI`'s file in the gemspec to make it
  available when downloading.

## Version 3.3.0

* Fix the stripping of surrounding characters that should be removed
  during anchor generation.
* Provide a `Redcarpet::CLI` class to create custom binary files.

  Relying on Ruby's OptionParser, it's now straightforward to add new
  options, rely on custom render objects or handle differently the
  rendering of the provided files.
* Undeprecate the compatibility layer for the old RedCloth API.

  This layer actually ease the support of libraries supporting different
  Markdown processors.
* Strip out `style` tags at the HTML-block rendering level when the
  `:no_styles` options is enabled ; previously they were only removed
  inside paragraphs.
* Avoid parsing images when the given URL isn't safe and the
  `:safe_links_only` option is enabled.

  *Alex Serban*
* Avoid parsing references inside fenced code blocks so they are
  now kept in the code snippet.

  *David Waller*
* Avoid escaping table-of-contents' headers by default. A new
  `:escape_html` option is now available for the `HTML_TOC` object
  if there are security concerns.
* Add the `lang-` prefix in front of the language's name when using
  `:prettify` along with `:fenced_code_blocks`.
* Non-alphanumeric chars are now stripped out from generated anchors
  (along the lines of Active Support's `#parameterize` method).

## Version 3.2.3

* Avoid rewinding content of a previous inline when autolinking is
  enabled.

  *Daniel LeCheminant*
* Fix escaping of forward slashes with the `Safe` render object (add a
  missing semi-colon).

## Version 3.2.2

* Consider `script` as a block-level element so it doesn't get included
  inside a paragraph.

## Version 3.2.1

* Load `RedcarpetCompat` when requiring Redcarpet for the sake of
  backward compatibility.

  *Loren Segal*

## Version 3.2.0

* Add a `Safe` renderer to deal with users' input. The `escape_html`
  and `safe_links_only` options are turned on by default.

  Moreover, the `block_code` callback removes the tag's class since
  the user can basically set anything with the vanilla one.

  *Robin Dupret*
* HTML5 block-level tags are now recognized

  *silverhammermba*
* The `StripDown` render object now displays the URL of links
  along with the text.

  *Robin Dupret*
* The RedCloth API compatibility layer is now deprecated.

  *Robin Dupret*
* A hyphen and an equal should not be converted to heading.

  *namusyaka*
* Fix emphasis character escape sequence detection while mid-emphasis.

  *jcheatham*
* Add `=` to the whitelist of escaped chars so it can be used inside
  highlighted snippets.

  *jcheatham*
* Convert trailing single quotes to curly quotes. For example,
  `Road Trippin'` now converts to `Road Trippin’`.

  *Kevin Chen*
* Allow in-page links (e.g. `[headline](#headline)`) when `:safe_links_only` is set.

  *jomo*
* Enable emphasis inside of sentences in multi-byte languages when
  `:no_intra_emphasis` is set.

  *Chun-wei Kuo*
* Avoid making `:no_intra_emphasis` only match spaces. This allows
  using emphasizes inside quotes when the option is enabled for
  instance.

  *Jason Webb* and *BJ Homer*
* The StripDown renderer handles image tags now.

## Version 3.1.2

* Remove the yielding of anchors in the `header` callback. This was
  a breaking change between 3.0 and 3.1 as the method's arity changed.

## Version 3.1.1

* Fix a segfault when parsing text with headers.

## Version 3.1.0

* Yield the anchor of the headers

  Using the `header` callback, it's now possible to get access to the
  humanized generated id to easily keep tracking of the tree of headers
  or simply handle the duplicate values easily.

  Since the `HTML_TOC` and `HTML` objects both have this callback, it's
  advisable to define a module and mix it in these objects to avoid
  code duplication.

  *Robin Dupret*
* Allow using tabs between a reference's colon and its link

  Fix issue [#337](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/337)

  *Juan Guerrero*
* Make ordered lists preceded by paragraph parsed with `:lax_spacing`

  Previously, enabling the `:lax_spacing` option, if a paragraph was
  followed by an ordered list it was unparsed and was part of the
  paragraph but this is no more the case.

  *Robin Dupret*
* Feed the gemspec into ExtensionTask so that we can pre-compile.
  ie. `rake native gem`

  *Todd Edwards*
* Revert lax indent of less than 4 characters after list items

  Follow the standard to detect when new paragraph is outside last item.
  Fixes [issue #111](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/111).

  *Eric Bréchemier*
* Fix code blocks' classes when using Google code prettify

  When using the the `:prettify` option and specifying the
  language name, the generated code block's class had a missing
  space.

  *Simonini*
* Add `-v`/`--version` and `-h` flags to commandline redcarpet

  *Lukas Stabe*
* Add optional quote support through the `:quote` option. Render
  quotations marks to `q` HTML tag.

  This is a `"quote"`.

  *Anatol Broder*
* Ensure inline markup in titles is correctly stripped when generating
  headers' anchor.

  *Robin Dupret*
* Revert the unescaping behavior on comments

  This behavior doesn't follow the conformance suite.

  *Robin Dupret*
* Add optional footnotes support

  Add PHP-Markdown style footnotes through the `:footnotes` option.

  *Ben Dolman, Adam Florin, microjo, brief*
* Enable GitHub style anchors for headers

  Passing the `with_toc_data` option to a `HTML` render object now
  generates GitHub style anchors.

  *Matt Rogers*
* Allow to set a maximum rendering level for HTML\_TOC

  Allow the user to pass a `nesting_level` option when instantiating a
  new HTML\_TOC render object in order to limit the nesting level in the
  generated table of content. For example:

  ```
  Redcarpet::Markdown.new(Redcarpet::Render::HTML_TOC.new(nesting_level: 2))
  ```

  *Robin Dupret*

## Version 3.0.0

* Remove support for Ruby 1.8.x *Matt Rogers & Robin Dupret*
* Avoid escaping for HTML comments *Robin Dupret*
* Make emphasis wrapped inside parenthesis parsed *Robin Dupret*
* Remove the Sundown submodule *Robin Dupret*
* Fix FTP uris identified as emails *Robin Dupret*
* Add optional highlight support *Sam Soffes*

  This is `==highlighted==`.
* Ensure nested parenthesis are handled into links *Robin Dupret*
* Ensure nested code spans put in emphasis work correctly *Robin Dupret*

## Version 2.3.0

* Add a `:disable_indented_code_blocks` option *Dmitriy Kiriyenko*
* Fix issue [#57](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/57) *Mike Morearty*
* Ensure new lines characters are inserted when using the StripDown
  render. *Robin Dupret*
* Mark all symbols as hidden except the main entry point *Tom Hughes*

  This avoids conflicts with other gems that may have some of the
  same symbols, such as escape\_utils which also uses houdini.
* Remove unnecessary function pointer *Sam Soffes*
* Add optional underline support *Sam Soffes*

  This is `*italic*` and this is `_underline_` when enabled.
* Test that links with quotes work *Michael Grosser*
* Adding a prettyprint class for google-code-prettify *Joel Rosenberg*
* Remove unused C macros *Matt Rogers*
* Remove 'extern' definition for Init\_redcarpet\_rndr() *Matt Rogers*
* Remove Gemfile.lock from the gemspec *Matt Rogers*
* Removed extra unused test statement. *Slipp D. Thompson*
* Use test-unit gem to get some red/green output when running tests
  *Michael Grosser*
* Remove a deprecation warning and update Gemfile.lock *Robin Dupret*
* Added contributing file *Brent Beer*
* For tests for libxml2 > 2.8 *strzibny*
* SmartyPants: Preserve single `backticks` in HTML *Mike Morearty*

  When SmartyPants is processing HTML, single `backticks` should be left
  intact. Previously they were being deleted.
* Removed and ignored Gemfile.lock *Ryan McGeary*
* Added support for org-table syntax *Ryan McGeary*

  Adds support for using a plus (+) as an intersection character instead of
  requiring pipes (|). The emacs org-mode table syntax automatically manages
  ascii tables, but uses pluses for line intersections.
* Ignore /tmp directory *Ryan McGeary*
* Add redcarpet\_ prefix for `stack_*` functions *Kenta Murata*
* Mark any html\_attributes has held by a renderer as used *Tom Hughes*
* Add Rubinius to the list of tested implementations *Gibheer*
* Add a changelog file
