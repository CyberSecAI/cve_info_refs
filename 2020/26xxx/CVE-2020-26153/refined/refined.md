Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-26153

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Event Espresso Core WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `page` URL parameter is directly outputted in the response without HTML encoding or any form of input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. The application directly reflects the user-supplied input in the response, which allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The vulnerable template file was not intended to be directly accessible, however, there were no checks in place to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing it directly and triggering the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, attackers can perform various malicious actions within the victim's browser context.
- **Cookie Stealing:** Attackers can steal cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user sessions.
- **Credential Theft:** The injected JavaScript could be used to harvest user credentials.
- **PII Theft:** Personal Identifiable Information (PII) could be stolen.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect the user to a malicious website, prompting them to execute malware.
- **Website Defacement:** The website's appearance or functionality could be modified by the injected code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GET Request with Malicious Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a GET request to the vulnerable template file with a crafted `page` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerable template file was located at `wp-content/plugins/event-espresso-core-reg/admin_pages/messages/templates/ee_msg_admin_overview.template.php`
-   The vulnerability was present in Event Espresso Core versions 4.10.6.p and below.
-   The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.10.7.p by removing the affected template file.
-   The vulnerability was present due to a request parameter being directly outputted to the page, and the lack of a check to ensure the template was loaded by WordPress.
