Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26076:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication for sensitive information within Cisco IoT Field Network Director (FND). This means that access control mechanisms were not properly implemented or enforced to protect sensitive data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The core weakness is the absence of authentication checks before granting access to sensitive database information. This allows any attacker to potentially view the data.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability specifically leads to the disclosure of sensitive database information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can view sensitive database information on the affected device. This could include configuration details, user credentials, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **Crafted Curl Commands:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specifically crafted `curl` commands to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Cisco IoT FND device.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need prior authentication or credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Products:** Cisco IoT FND releases prior to version 4.6.1 are vulnerable.
- **No Workarounds:**  There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than upgrading to a fixed software release.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 (Medium), with a vector of `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`.
- **Exploitation Status:** At the time of the advisory, Cisco was not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
