Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-26989:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR files in affected applications.

**Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow occurs due to insufficient input validation before copying data to a fixed-size buffer on the stack.

**Impact:**
- An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could potentially lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vector:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted PAR file.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious PAR file to the user.
- The user must then open the malicious PAR file using the vulnerable application (Solid Edge, JT2Go or Teamcenter Visualization) to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Siemens by the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
- The vulnerability is addressed in Solid Edge SE2020MP12 and SE2021MP2, JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization V13.1.0.1 or later.
- The CVSS v3.1 base score is 7.8 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C. This indicates a high severity vulnerability.
- The associated CWE is CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
