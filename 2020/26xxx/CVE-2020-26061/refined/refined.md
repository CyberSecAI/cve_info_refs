Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26061:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided content from GitHub, including the `CVE-2020-26061.py` exploit script and the related README, directly relates to the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-26061. The content confirms this CVE affects ClickStudios Passwordstate and describes an authentication bypass in the password reset portal.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a flaw in the `ResetPassword` function within the Passwordstate Password Reset Portal. It fails to validate whether the user has successfully authenticated using the security questions before allowing a password reset. This means the security questions can be bypassed.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper authentication checks before allowing password resets.
*   **Insecure Password Reset:** The password reset functionality allows an unauthenticated attacker to set a new password for any user.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker can take control of any user account on the affected Passwordstate system by resetting their password.
*   **Data Breach:** After taking over accounts, an attacker could potentially access sensitive passwords stored within the Passwordstate vault, leading to a data breach.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Compromised accounts can grant unauthorized access to systems and applications managed by Passwordstate.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Network Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network, without any prior authentication.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack involves crafting and sending a specific HTTP POST request to the `/account/ResetPassword` endpoint.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the Passwordstate web server.
*   **Knowledge of Username:** The attacker requires knowledge of the target user's username (including the domain prefix)
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have any existing credentials or knowledge of the user's security questions.

**Technical Details from Exploit Script:**

*   The provided `CVE-2020-26061.py` script shows how the exploit works. It:
    *   Takes the target URL, domain, and username as input.
    *   Constructs a specific URL `/account/ResetPassword`

    *   Does not include any validation of security questions
    *   Upon success, displays a message of success, including username and newly created password.
