Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities discussed:

**1. Vulnerabilities in webcasts.com (integrated with 6Connex):**

*   **Root Cause:** Flaws in the platform's handling of attendee data and access controls.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Information Disclosure/PII Leakage:**  Attendee IDs were exposed, allowing access to a large data dump of user information. This included names, company and title, emails, IP addresses, and potentially city, state, phone number and physical address.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized users could access sensitive personal information of all attendees of the event.
*   **Attack Vector:** Accessing attendee data through exposed attendee IDs within the platform.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Attendee level access to the virtual event platform

**2. Vulnerabilities in VFairs (version 3.33):**

*   **Root Cause:**  Insufficient input validation and flawed access controls in user profile management, and SQL database access.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Profile Manipulation:** Ability to change other users' profiles by manipulating ID numbers.
    *   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** Profile manipulation could lead to XSS attacks, allowing attackers to steal user cookies, impersonate users or redirect them to malicious sites.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The ability to upload PHP code through profile pictures, leading to potential RCE.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Time-based blind SQL injection vulnerability exposed, providing direct database access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   User impersonation
    *   Data theft
    *   Remote code execution, potentially leading to full server control.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Manipulating user profile IDs to access and modify other users' profiles.
    *   Uploading malicious code through profile picture upload.
    *   Exploiting SQL injection vulnerability.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Attendee level access to the virtual event platform.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The article emphasizes the risk of using third-party platforms without proper security vetting, highlighting the potential for supply chain attacks.
*   Both VFairs and 6Connex were notified and have since patched the identified vulnerabilities. VFairs in version 3.34.
*   The article also mentions a separate SMB supply chain breach on Axial, which exposed sensitive financial information.
