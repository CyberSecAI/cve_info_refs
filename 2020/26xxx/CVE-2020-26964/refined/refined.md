Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26964:

**CVE-2020-26964: Firefox for Android's Remote Debugging via USB could have been abused by untrusted apps on older versions of Android**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stemmed from the fact that the "Remote Debugging via USB" feature in Firefox for Android used a unix domain socket for communication. This socket was intended to be protected by Android's SELinux policy. However, on Android versions prior to 6.0 (Marshmallow), SELinux was not enforced, thus allowing untrusted applications to connect to the debugging socket.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness was the lack of proper access control on the debugging socket on older Android versions. The reliance on SELinux for security without verifying its enforcement on all supported Android versions created a vulnerability.

*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker (i.e., an untrusted application) could connect to the debugging socket and gain the ability to read and interact with web content displayed in the Firefox for Android browser. This could be used to perform actions with the privileges of the browser, potentially leading to information theft or other malicious activity.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector was a malicious application installed on an Android device running a version older than 6.0, where the user had enabled "Remote debugging via USB".
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needed to have an application installed on the target device and the "Remote debugging via USB" feature to be enabled. The attacker application would then directly connect to the unsecured domain socket and send commands to Firefox. The user had to enable remote debugging via USB.

**Additional Information:**

*   The bug report ([Bug 1658865](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1658865)) provides detailed information about the vulnerability, including a code example demonstrating the exploit and a link to the relevant Android SELinux policy.
*   The fix for this issue involved disabling the "Remote Debugging via USB" feature on affected devices, specifically those running Android versions older than 6.0.
*  The vulnerability was classified as "sec-low" severity.
*   The issue was fixed in Firefox 83 and later.
