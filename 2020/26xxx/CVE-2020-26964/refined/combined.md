Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2020-50

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 83

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 83

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

##### References

* [Bug 1667113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113)

#### [#CVE-2020-26952: Out of memory handling of JITed, inlined functions could lead to a memory corruption](#CVE-2020-26952)

Reporter
Gary Kwong
Impact
high
##### Description

Incorrect bookkeeping of functions inlined during JIT compilation could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash when handling out-of-memory errors.

##### References

* [Bug 1667685](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667685)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1642028](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1642028)

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

##### References

* [Bug 1656741](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741)

#### [#CVE-2020-26954: Local spoofing of web manifests for arbitrary pages in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26954)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When accepting a malicious intent from other installed apps, Firefox for Android accepted manifests from arbitrary file paths and allowed declaring webapp manifests for other origins. This could be used to gain fullscreen access for UI spoofing and could also lead to cross-origin attacks on targeted websites.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1657026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1657026)

#### [#CVE-2020-26955: Cookies set during file downloads are shared between normal and Private Browsing Mode in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26955)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a user downloaded a file in Firefox for Android, if a cookie is set, it would have been re-sent during a subsequent file download operation on the same domain, regardless of whether the original and subsequent request were in private and non-private browsing modes.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1663261](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663261)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

##### References

* [Bug 1666300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300)

#### [#CVE-2020-26957: OneCRL was not working in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26957)

Reporter
Kevin Brosnan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

OneCRL was non-functional in the new Firefox for Android due to a missing service initialization. This could result in a failure to enforce some certificate revocations.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1667179](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667179)

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1669466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

##### References

* [Bug 1672223](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672223)

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

##### References

* [Bug 1672528](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672528)

#### [#CVE-2020-26962: Cross-origin iframes supported login autofill](#CVE-2020-26962)

Reporter
Paul Stone
Impact
low
##### Description

Cross-origin iframes that contained a login form could have been recognized by the login autofill service, and populated. This could have been used in clickjacking attacks, as well as be read across partitions in dynamic first party isolation.

##### References

* [Bug 610997](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=610997)

#### [#CVE-2020-26963: History and Location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser](#CVE-2020-26963)

Reporter
Sachin Raste
Impact
low
##### Description

Repeated calls to the history and location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser. This was addressed by introducing rate-limiting to these API calls.

##### References

* [Bug 1314912](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1314912)

#### [#CVE-2020-26964: Firefox for Android's Remote Debugging via USB could have been abused by untrusted apps on older versions of Android](#CVE-2020-26964)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
low
##### Description

If the Remote Debugging via USB feature was enabled in Firefox for Android on an Android version prior to Android 6.0, untrusted apps could have connected to the feature and operated with the privileges of the browser to read and interact with web content. The feature was implemented as a unix domain socket, protected by the Android SELinux policy; however, SELinux was not enforced for versions prior to 6.0. This was fixed by removing the Remote Debugging via USB feature from affected devices.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1658865](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1658865)

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

Reporter
Kaizer Soze
Impact
low
##### Description

When listening for page changes with a Mutation Observer, a malicious web page could confuse Firefox Screenshots into interacting with elements other than those that it injected into the page. This would lead to internal errors and unexpected behavior in the Screenshots code.

high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Byron Campen, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

Mozilla developers Tyson Smith, Aaron Klotz, David Major and Jason Kratzer reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9169750&action=edit)

I'm not sure whether this is a security bug or by design (i.e., already considered & accepted risk), but Fenix's remote debugging socket can be connected from untrusted apps if Android OS version is older than 6.

When user enables "Remote debbuging via USB", Fenix creates an unix domain socket that name is `firefox-debugger-socket`. That socket is not explicitly protected by Fenix itself but it's not connectable from untrusted apps because unix sockets are banned by Android's SELinux policy (below).

[https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/sepolicy/+/57531cacb40682be4b1189c721fd1e7f25bf3786/untrusted\_app.te#137](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/sepolicy/%2B/57531cacb40682be4b1189c721fd1e7f25bf3786/untrusted_app.te#137)

But the SELinux policy was enforced from Android version 6.0 (Marshmallow).

Android older than 6.0 (such as 5.1 Lollipop) allows to use them without any permissions.

As you know Android 5.1 is very old, but still they has about 8% share. Also Mozilla website clearly mentions that Firefox is compatible with Android 4.1 or above devices (below).

<https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/will-firefox-work-my-mobile-device#mobile::m79>

If so, in order to protect the debugger socket, there should be some protections in Fenix itself, for example, hiding "Remote debbuging via USB" button on old devices.

The following Kotlin code can reproduce this issue on Nexus 6 emulator with Android 5.1 stock image. See also attached animation gif for the demo.

```
var socket = LocalSocket()
var addr = LocalSocketAddress("org.mozilla.fenix/firefox-debugger-socket")
socket.connect(addr)
Toast.makeText(applicationContext, "Connected", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
var reader: Scanner = Scanner(socket.getInputStream())
var writer: OutputStream = socket.getOutputStream()
reader.nextLine()

// List tab request
var req = "48:{\"type\":\"listTabs\",\"favicons\":false,\"to\":\"root\"}"
writer.write((req + '\n').toByteArray(Charset.defaultCharset()))

// Parse response
var resp = reader.nextLine().toString()
var index = resp.indexOf("{", 0)
var tabs = JSONObject(resp.substring(index)).getJSONArray("tabs")

// Show tab info
for(i in 0 until tabs.length()) {
    var tab = tabs.getJSONObject(i)
    var outerWindowID = tab.getInt("outerWindowID")
    var title = tab.getString("title")
    var url = tab.getString("url")
    var output = "#${i+1} Window ID: ${outerWindowID}\nTitle: ${title}\n URL: ${url}"
    Toast.makeText(applicationContext, output, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
}
socket.close()

```

Thank you for providing a demo!

I think this is sec-low. I could be convinced that this is sec-moderate if the affected Android versions weren't so old. It still requires the user to run a bad app.

Stefan, what's our support for Android 5.1. Is this here a WONTFIX?

We still support Android 5.0 and 5.1. It is not 8% of users it is under 4%. We should disable this for Android 5.0 and 5.1. Should be able to stop this by disabling the USB debugging option in the affected Android versions. We should document it at [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/about:debugging#Connecting\_to\_a\_remote\_device](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/about%3Adebugging#Connecting_to_a_remote_device) that Android 5.0 and 5.1 do not have this feature.

Seems like this would be safe to uplift to 83?

Couple of profiles that may or may not be useful
STR: Take the script from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1314912#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - history.pushState - Firefox Hangs and then iterating script error"), edit the iterations to a smaller number (i.e. 1000 and 3000), run in scratchpad
Here's a loop of 1000 times in a profile <https://perfht.ml/2BrMBrF> - the 3 jumps on cp4 is the script running. This was just minor hangs, browser still basically usable.
And then <https://perfht.ml/2BsHibB> which is 3000 loops and locked up the browser for 15 seconds or so

Attached patch

[Add a rate limit to calls to pushState/replaceState](attachment.cgi?id=8933783&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8933783&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1314912&attachment=8933783)

This looks like it was fixed by Chromium in
<https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=394296>. It was fixed by
adding a rate limit to calls to pushState and replaceState.
I figure we might as well do the same thing - this patch adds a similar rate
limit to pushState and replaceState in Gecko.

[bug 1246773](/show_bug.cgi?id=1246773 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Rate-limit history.pushState use - when visiting certain website (misuse of History.pushState), browser hangs and consumes loads of memory") is the same issue (and has 3 other dupes). Even with multi-process this hangs the parent/browser in addition to the child. Manually killing the child process eventually led to me getting my browser back, but took a while (30-60s) before the parent became responsive again.Assignee: nika → nobodySee Also: → <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=394296>

Looks like we do need to handle location.hash. The latest Chrome Canary / Safari Tech Preview are also suffering from location.hash flooding, BTW. Not sure if there're other cases we need to worry about.

Your patch looks more polished than mine but I can finish this bug up if you'd like. Handling location.hash should be possible too, we can approach it in the same way.

There wasn't much to store in the parent process, and the session history length is limited to 50 entries so there shouldn't be much to store in the child process either. The issue was mainly that the frequency of sendAsyncMessage from the child is a few times faster than the parent can consume, which keeps the parent process busy and the chrome UI extremely non-responsive.
Besides, it seems the parent process was too busy to schedule GC, so the memory size keeps growing. According to the DMD output in [bug 1380305 comment #16](/show_bug.cgi?id=1380305#c16 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Malicious website causes unlimited locationchange messages to DoS parent process") I believe it was the URI generated in RemoteWebNavigation which consumes the memory:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/31606bbabc50b08895d843b9f5f3da938ccdfbbf/toolkit/modules/RemoteWebProgress.jsm#251>
On my Linux machine, it can cause thrashing in a few minutes and make the whole system be non-responsive. It seems anything causes infinite OnLocationChange has the same effect. I just realized I can also reproduce it with a few `pushState` and then a simple `history.back` + `history.forward` loop. Now I'm thinking that we should probably throttle all LOCATION\_CHANGE\_SAME\_DOCUMENT navigation.

[Bug 1314912 - Part 1: Throttle same document navigation caused by content scripts, if there have been too many LOCATION\_CHANGE\_SAME\_DOCUMENT caused by content scripts in a short time frame.](attachment.cgi?id=8935252)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=8935252&action=edit)

The patch records the number of successive LOCATION\_CHANGE\_SAME\_DOCUMENT when
the incumbent global exists and it's not system principal, which should
basically indicate content scripts are using History or Location APIs.
When the number of successive LOCATION\_CHANGE\_SAME\_DOCUMENT recorded exceeds
the limit, it throws in InternalLoad and AddState if the caller is from content
scripts and it's making same document navigation.

What happens if the page does a bunch of click() on anchors that point to the page url, but with different refs? That comes via OnLinkClickEvent. Does the AutoJSAPI there give us an incumbent global? I would expect it does not, and that situation won't be caught by this code.
Ideally, we would explicitly check whatever would become the triggering principal for the load in the load case...

Hmm. So this will mean that if too many history.back() happen in a row, they could start failing?
But why should we block back() or forward() ever? It's \_adding\_ things to the history that's a problem, no?

Not really. Anything that causes excessive location changes can DoS the parent process and hang the chrome UI. See [comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=1314912#c17 "RESOLVED FIXED - history.pushState - Firefox Hangs and then iterating script error").

I'm worrying about intermittent failures on try server if we do another `setTimeut` within 3 seconds. [Bug 1362410](/show_bug.cgi?id=1362410 "RESOLVED FIXED - Intermittent docshell/test/browser/browser_bug1347823.js | \"modified\" == \"page1\" -") shows that 1 second ExpirationTracker can take more than 3 seconds to run on try server.

> Where are we testing that once we've reached the cap other attemptes within the 3s timeout will fail too?
I'm worrying about intermittent failures on try server if we do another `setTimeut` within 3 seconds. [Bug 1362410](/show_bug.cgi?id=1362410 "RESOLVED FIXED - Intermittent docshell/test/browser/browser_bug1347823.js | \"modified\" == \"page1\" -") shows that 1 second ExpirationTracker can take more than 3 seconds to run on try server.

> I'm worrying about intermittent failures on try server if we do another `setTimeut` within 3 seconds
Sure. But when the timer fires you can check how much time has \_actually\_ passed and decide whether to actually try to assert anything about the state at that point if too much time has passed.

[Bug 1314912 - Rate limit calls to History and Location interfaces. r=smaug](attachment.cgi?id=9175572)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9175572&action=edit)

This adds a rate limit to all methods of the History interface and

the location.hash setter for non-system callers.

The rate limit is counted per BrowsingContextGroup, per process and can be controlled by prefs.

This patch is based on the original rate limit patch by :freesamael.
