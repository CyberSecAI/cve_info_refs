    {
      "source": "seclists.org_c84b82fc_20250119_121010.html",
      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The vulnerable function module `CNV_MBT_SEL_STRING_RETURN` uses the `INSERT REPORT` instruction to embed code into the ABAP repository. The source code is created dynamically using untrusted user input without proper input validation or output sanitization.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "ABAP Code Injection",
          "Lack of input validation",
          "Lack of output sanitization"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can embed arbitrary ABAP code into the ABAP Repository, potentially leading to full system compromise when chained with other vulnerabilities like CVE-2021-21473.",
        "attackVectors": "The vulnerable function module can be invoked remotely via the RFC protocol.",
         "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker with the ability to make RFC calls can exploit this vulnerability."
