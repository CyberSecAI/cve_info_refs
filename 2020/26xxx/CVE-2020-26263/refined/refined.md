  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption code in tlslite-ng performs data-dependent operations during padding checks, leading to timing side-channel leaks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Timing side-channel vulnerability due to data-dependent operations in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption.",
      "The code aborts early if the plaintext doesn't start with 0x00, 0x02, leaking information about the decrypted ciphertext."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can potentially recover plaintext by analyzing the timing differences in decryption and padding checks. This affects TLS servers using RSA key exchange and applications utilizing the vulnerable RSA decryption API directly.",
    "attack_vectors": "By observing the timing of responses from a vulnerable server or application, an attacker can gain information about the decrypted ciphertext.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to make multiple decryption requests and measure the time taken to receive responses. This can be done remotely in the case of TLS servers or locally for vulnerable applications."

  ],
  "additional_notes": "The fix involves implementing deterministic implicit rejection for RSA decryption and using constant-time operations as much as possible. However, it is noted that Python's byte processing may not be fully constant time. Users requiring complete side-channel resistance are advised to use other TLS implementations."
