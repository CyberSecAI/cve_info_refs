{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `tf.raw_ops.DataFormatVecPermute` and `tf.raw_ops.DataFormatDimMap` APIs in TensorFlow do not validate the `src_format` and `dst_format` attributes, which are expected to define a permutation of `NHWC`. Lack of input validation allows attackers to specify arbitrary format strings which can lead to uninitialized memory accesses, reads outside of bounds, and crashes.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Input Validation",
    "Out-of-bounds Read",
    "Uninitialized Memory Access",
    "Crash"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause uninitialized memory accesses, read outside of bounds, and even crash the TensorFlow application by providing invalid `src_format` and `dst_format` attributes to the `tf.raw_ops.DataFormatVecPermute` and `tf.raw_ops.DataFormatDimMap` APIs.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `tf.raw_ops.DataFormatVecPermute` and `tf.raw_ops.DataFormatDimMap` APIs with crafted `src_format` and `dst_format` attributes.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to call the vulnerable APIs with attacker-controlled inputs for the `src_format` and `dst_format` arguments."
