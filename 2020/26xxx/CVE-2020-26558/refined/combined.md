| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1918601#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2021-01-21 08:01:51 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel, where Bluetooth BR/EDR PIN Pairing procedure is vulnerable to an impersonation attack. When an attacker connects to a victim device using the address of the device and the victim initiates a Pairing, the attacker can reflect the encrypted nonce even without knowledge of the key.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1918601#c6)  Rohit Keshri    2021-05-12 19:29:34 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  It is recommended that devices not accept connections from or initiate connections to remote devices claiming the same Bluetooth device address as their own, also a controller computing a null (zero-valued) combination not accept this key as a valid and fail any pairing attempt that produced a null key.  It is also recommends that BR/EDR implementations enable Secure Simple Pairing, and where possible, implementations enable and enforce Secure Connections Only Mode, ensuring that pin-code pairing cannot be used.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1918601#c10)  Rohit Keshri    2021-05-26 12:56:58 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1964967](show_bug.cgi?id=1964967 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-26555 kernel: Bluetooth BR/EDR PIN Pairing procedure is vulnerable to an impersonation attack [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1918601#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-04-30 10:07:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  Via RHSA-2024:2394 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2394](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A2394)   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=1918601#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-02 08:53:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:4211 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4211](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4211)   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=1918601#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2024-07-08 02:01:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2024:4352 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4352](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024%3A4352)   ``` |  |

## Bluetooth SIG Statement Regarding the *Exploiting Cross-Transport Key Derivation in Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy* (BLURtooth) and the *Security implications of key conversion between BR/EDR and BLE* Vulnerabilities

Researchers at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), the University of Oxford, and the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, and researchers at Purdue University have independently identified vulnerabilities related to Cross-Transport Key Derivation (CTKD) in implementations supporting pairing and encryption with both Bluetooth BR/EDR and LE in Bluetooth Specifications 4.2 through 5.0. The researches identified that CTKD, when implemented to older versions of the specification, may permit escalation of access between the two transports with non-authenticated encryption keys replacing authenticated keys or weaker encryption keys replacing stronger encryption keys.

*The researchers also identified that CTKD may permit a remote paired device to access some LE services if BR/EDR access is achieved or BR/EDR profiles if LE access is achieved. As this is the intended use of CTKD, these cross-transport procedures are not being considered vulnerabilities by the SIG.*

For this attack to be successful, an attacking device would need to be within wireless range of a vulnerable Bluetooth device supporting both BR/EDR and LE transports that supports CTKD between the transports and permits pairing on either the BR/EDR or LE transport either with no authentication (e.g. JustWorks) or no user-controlled access restrictions on the availability of pairing. If a device spoofing another device’s identity becomes paired or bonded on a transport and CTKD is used to derive a key which then overwrites a pre-existing key of greater strength or that was created using authentication, then access to authenticated services may occur. This may permit a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack between devices previously bonded using authenticated pairing when those peer devices are both vulnerable.

The Bluetooth SIG is recommending that potentially vulnerable implementations introduce the restrictions on Cross-Transport Key Derivation mandated in Bluetooth Core Specification versions 5.1 and later.

The Bluetooth SIG is also broadly communicating details on this vulnerability and its remedies to our member companies and is encouraging them to rapidly integrate any necessary patches.  As always, Bluetooth users should ensure they have installed the latest recommended updates from device and operating system manufacturers.

For more information, please refer to the statement from the [CERT Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/589825/).

                 CVE-2021-33034

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service, or information leaks.

This update is not yet available for the armel (ARM EABI soft-float)
architecture.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly
    of fragmented packets.  In some circumstances, an attacker within
    range of a network could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary
    packets and/or to access sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the "is
    aggregated" packet header flag.  An attacker within range of a
    network could exploit this to forge arbitrary packets on that
    network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

    kiyin (尹亮) of TenCent discovered several reference counting bugs
    in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to use-after-free.
    A local user could exploit these for denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered that
    the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that could
    result in use-after-free and double-free.  This has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

    kiyin (尹亮) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the NFC LLCP
    implementation.  A local user could exploit this for denial of
    service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211.  When operating in AP mode, they would
    forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender
    was not yet authenticated.  An attacker within range of a network
    could use this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting
    other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

    Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
    Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of
    it.  An attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they
    pair using Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the
    shared secret (Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices
    to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

    The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
    implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
    invalid attributes for a file.  A local user permitted to run a
    FUSE server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    The original fix for this introduced a different potential denial
    of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2021-3428

    Wolfgang Frisch reported a potential integer overflow in the ext4
    filesystem driver. A user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem
    images could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3483

    马哲宇 (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the "nosy" driver for TI
    PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list corruption
    and a use-after-free.  On a system that uses this driver, local
    users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

    The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the
    Bluetooth subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or
    double-free.  A local user could exploit these to caue a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

    Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential null
    pointer dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation.  A local user
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-20292

    It was discovered that the TTM buffer allocation API used by GPU
    drivers did not handle allocation failures in the way that most
    drivers expected, resulting in a double-free on failure.  A local
    user on a system using one of these drivers could possibly exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    for privilege escalation.  The API has been changed to match
    driver expectations.

CVE-2021-23133

    Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the
    SCTP implementation, which can lead to list corruption.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28660

    It was discovered that the rtl8188eu WiFi driver did not correctly
    limit the length of SSIDs copied into scan results. An attacker
    within WiFi range could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to execute code on a
    vulnerable system.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

    It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930
    (XSA-365) introduced a potential resource leak.  A malicious guest
    could presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (resource exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

    Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which
    can lead to an assertion failure.  On systems using Btrfs, a local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

    Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for
    Intel PEBS.  A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs
    codenamed "Haswell" and earlier could lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  On systems with the affected CPUs, if users are
    permitted to access performance events, a local user may exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users do not have access to performance
    events, which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

    It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler
    for x86_64 generated incorrect branch instructions in some
    cases.  On systems where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could
    exploit this to execute arbitrary code in the kernel.

    By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.  This is
    controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29265

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the USB/IP host
    (server) implementation which can lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  On a system acting as a USB/IP host, a client
    can exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-29647

    The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC
    Router (qrtr) implementation.

    This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

    It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem
    could lead to a null pointer dereference during replacement of a
    table.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    namespace could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users cannot create user namespaces,
    which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-30002

    Arnd Bergmann and the syzbot tool found a memory leak in the
    Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem.  A local user permitted to access
    video devices (by default, any member of the "video" group) could
    exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2021-31916

    Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
    device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
    overrun.  However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
    (i.e. root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not
    have any security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

    The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.272-1.  This update additionally includes many more bug fixes from
stable updates 4.9.259-4.9.272 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Bluetooth SIG Statement Regarding the Regarding the ‘Impersonation in the Passkey Entry Protocol’ Vulnerability

Researchers at the Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information (ANSSI) have identified a vulnerability related to Passkey authentication in BR/EDR Secure Simple Pairing in Bluetooth® Core Specifications 2.1 through 5.2, BR/EDR Secure Connections Pairing in Bluetooth Core Specifications 4.1 through 5.2 and LE Secure Connections Pairing in Bluetooth Core Specifications 4.2 through 5.2. The researchers identified that it was possible for an attacker acting as a MITM in the Passkey authentication procedure to use a crafted series of responses to determine each bit of the randomly generated Passkey selected by the pairing initiator in each round of the pairing procedure, and once identified, to use these Passkey bits during the same pairing session to successfully complete the authenticated pairing procedure with the responder.

After successful completion of the authentication procedure, the responder will be authenticated to the attacker rather than the initiator, permitting the attacker to act in the role of an encrypted and authenticated peer. The attacker does not succeed in pairing with the initiator by this method, preventing a fully transparent MITM attack on the pairing procedure between the initiator and responder.

For this attack to be successful, an attacking device needs to be within wireless range of two vulnerable Bluetooth devices initiating pairing or bonding where a BR/EDR IO Capabilities exchange or LE IO Capability in the pairing request and response results in the selection of the Passkey pairing procedure.

The Bluetooth SIG is recommending that potentially vulnerable implementations restrict the public keys accepted from a remote peer device to disallow a remote peer to present the same public key chosen by the local device.

The Bluetooth SIG is also broadly communicating details on this vulnerability and its remedies to our member companies and is encouraging them to rapidly integrate any necessary patches.  As always, Bluetooth users should ensure they have installed the latest recommended updates from device and operating system manufacturers.

For more information, please refer to the statement from the [CERT Coordination Center.](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/799380/)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Package        : bluez
Version        : 5.43-2+deb9u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-26558 CVE-2021-0129

```
Two issues have been found in bluez, a package with Bluetooth tools and
daemons. One issue is about a man-in-the-middle attack during secure
pairing, the other is about information disclosure due to improper access
control.
```

```
In order to completely fix both issues, you need an updated kernel as
well! For Debian 9 Stretch this has been uploaded some days ago.
```

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
5.43-2+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your bluez packages.

For the detailed security status of bluez please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bluez>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

For more information regarding security and vulnerability events please visit the public Cradlepoint Security & Trust web page https://cradlepoint.
com/about-us/trust/

Known issues:

Feature: (All) SNMP Queries (GETs)

Scenario:

A user tries to get information from router using CLI commands like 'snmpwalk' and 'snmpget'.

The protocol used is SNMPv3 and the security level used is 'authPriv'

Failure:

The query request is rejected by the SNMP agent running in the router.

Reason for Failure:

The SNMP agent running in the router does not support 'authPriv' security level.

Even though the 'SNMP Configuration' on the router allows for security level 'authPriv', it is supported only for the
'Alert Notifications using SNMP' feature.

Workaround :

Use the supported security levels only - noAuthNoPriv or authNoPriv

Feature: (All) Wi-Fi client radios

Scenario:

A race condition could cause Wi-Fi radio startup failover on router boot.

Failure:

Wi-Fi radios will not beacon. The system log will contain a message "CRIT root Service start exception: wireless."

Workaround:

The router must be rebooted to restart and recover Wi-Fi radios.

Server-Configuration

NOTE:NetCloud OS 7.2.70 release is the last supported release for the AER1600 router. The AER1650 (non Wi-Fi version) continues to support
newer releases.

NOTE:NetCloud OS 7.2.70 release, and newer, no longer officially support USB attached 3rd party 3G/4G cellular modems. USB cellular
modems currently in-use will continue to function, however their support going forward is no longer guaranteed.

Additional UI/Usability changes:

No UI/usability changes in this release.

Defects fixed:

(Models with C4D, 150M-D modems) Integrated a workaround to address mis-configuration of the modem's carrier settings on a carrier
switch event.

(All) SDK application failed to run due to permission errors.

(All) NEMO tunnels will successfully establish but fail to pass traffic.

(E300, E3000) Forcing ethernet link speed when paired with some switch manufacturers resulted in degraded performance.

(All) Configuring SNMPv3 with SHA and AuthPriv does not work as expected.

(All) Cannot use GRE key of 0 when configuring DMVPN.

Security issues:

Note:  All customers are reminded that
changing the default Administration (login) and WiFi passwords
are necessary for router and network
security.  The default passwords are unique, but are not as safe as a strong password that only you know.  The security of the Internet depends
on your cooperation.

CVE-2018-18066 NULL pointer vulnerability in NET-SNMP addressed.

CVE-2020-12762 integer overflow and out-of-bounds write via a large JSON file in json-c addressed.

Cradlepoint Severity:Low

CVE-2018-18066 NULL pointer vulnerability in NET-SNMP addressed.

Affected Feature: SNMP (disabled by default)

Add copy about Security & Trust and link to web page https://cradlepoint.com/about-us/trust/

Known issues:

Feature: SNMP Queries (GETs)

Scenario:

A user tries to get information from router using CLI commands like 'snmpwalk' and 'snmpget'.

The protocol used is SNMPv3 and the security level used is 'authPriv'

Failure:

The query request is rejected by the SNMP agent running in the router.

Reason for Failure:

The SNMP agent running in the router does not support 'authPriv' security level.

Even though the 'SNMP Configuration' on the router allows for security level 'authPriv', it is supported only for the
'Alert Notifications using SNMP' feature.

Workaround :

Use the supported security levels only - noAuthNoPriv or authNoPriv

IBR1100 WiFi as WAN or Wireless Client modes

Scenario:

If a user makes WiFi configuration changes in the local Router UI.

Failure:

WiFi radio will crash.

Reason for Failure:

Unable to get scan results need for WiFi as WAN/Wireless Client connection.

Workaround:

Per best practice, use NetCloud Manager to make all configuration changes.

Package        : bluez
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-26558 CVE-2020-27153 CVE-2021-0129
Debian Bug     : 989614

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Bluez, the Linux Bluetooth
protocol stack.

CVE-2020-26558 / CVE-2021-0129

    It was discovered that Bluez does not properly check permissions
    during pairing operation, which could allow an attacker to
    impersonate the initiating device.

CVE-2020-27153

    Jay LV discovered a double free flaw in the disconnect_cb() routine
    in the gattool. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw
    during service discovery for denial of service, or potentially,
    execution of arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.50-1.2~deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your bluez packages.

For the detailed security status of bluez please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bluez>

### Summary:

Potential security vulnerabilities in BlueZ may allow information disclosure.  BlueZ is releasing Linux kernel Bluetooth subsystem updates to mitigate these potential vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerability Details:

CVEID:  [CVE-2021-0129](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-0129)

Description: Improper access control in BlueZ may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via adjacent access.

CVSS Base Score: 6.4 Medium

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

CVEID:  [CVE-2020-26558](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-26558) (Non-Intel issued)

Description: Bluetooth LE and BR/EDR secure pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification 2.1 through 5.2 may permit a nearby man-in-the-middle attacker to identify the Passkey used during pairing (in the Passkey authentication procedure) by reflection of the public key and the authentication evidence of the initiating device, potentially permitting this attacker to complete authenticated pairing with the responding device using the correct Passkey for the pairing session. The attack methodology determines the Passkey value one bit at a time.

CVSS Base Score: 4.2 Medium

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

### Affected Products:

All Linux kernel versions prior to 5.13 that support BlueZ.

### Recommendations:

Intel recommends installing the following kernel fix and BlueZ update to address these issues:

<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bluetooth/bluetooth-next.git/commit/net/bluetooth/smp.c?id=6d19628f539fccf899298ff02ee4c73e4bf6df3f>

<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/bluetooth/bluez.git/commit/?id=00da0fb4972cf59e1c075f313da81ea549cb8738>

Or use the following BlueZ releases which already incorporate the fixes:

·         kernel: 5.13

·         userspace:  <http://www.bluez.org/release-of-bluez-5-58-and-5-57/>

### Acknowledgements:

Intel would like to thank Agence Nationale de Securite des Systemes d'Information (ANSSI) for reporting CVE-2021-0129.

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are available.

## Devices supporting Bluetooth Core and Mesh Specifications are vulnerable to impersonation attacks and AuthValue disclosure

#### Vulnerability Note VU#799380

Original Release Date: 2021-05-24 | Last Revised: 2023-07-13

---

### Overview

Devices supporting the Bluetooth Core and Mesh Specifications are vulnerable to impersonation attacks and AuthValue disclosure that could allow an attacker to impersonate a legitimate device during pairing.

### Description

The Bluetooth [Core Specification](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/core-specification/) and [Mesh Profile Specification](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/mesh-profile-1-0-1/)  are two specifications used to define the technical and policy requirements for devices that want to operate over Bluetooth connections. Researchers at the Agence nationale de la sÃ©curitÃ© des systÃ¨mes d'information ([ANSSI](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/)) have identified a number of vulnerabilities in each specification that allow [impersonation attacks](https://francozappa.github.io/about-bias/publication/antonioli-20-bias/antonioli-20-bias.pdf) and AuthValue disclosures.

Devices supporting the Bluetooth Core Specification are affected by the following vulnerabilities:

#### Impersonation in the Passkey Entry Protocol

The Passkey Entry protocol used in Secure Simple Pairing (SSP), Secure Connections (SC), and LE Secure Connections (LESC) of the Bluetooth Core Specification is vulnerable to an impersonation attack that enables an active attacker to impersonate the initiating device without any previous knowledge (*CVE-2020-26558*). An attacker acting as a man-in-the-middle (MITM) in the Passkey authentication procedure could use a crafted series of responses to determine each bit of the randomly generated Passkey selected by the pairing initiator in each round of the pairing procedure, and once identified, the attacker can use these Passkey bits during the same pairing session to successfully complete the authenticated pairing procedure with the responder. Devices supporting BR/EDR Secure Simple Pairing in Bluetooth Core Specifications 2.1 through 5.2, BR/EDR Secure Connections Pairing in Bluetooth Core Specifications 4.1 through 5.2 and LE Secure Connections Pairing in Bluetooth Core Specifications 4.2 through 5.2 are affected by this vulnerability.

#### Impersonation in the Pin Pairing Protocol

The Bluetooth BR/EDR PIN Pairing procedure is vulnerable to an impersonation attack (*CVE-2020-26555*). An attacker could connect to a victim device by spoofing the Bluetooth Device Address (BD\_ADDR) of the device, reflect the the encrypted nonce, and complete BR/EDR pin-code pairing with them without knowledge of the pin code. A successful attack requires the attacking device to be within wireless range of a vulnerable device supporting BR/EDR Legacy Pairing that is Connectable and Bondable. Devices supporting the Bluetooth Core Specification versions 1.0B through 5.2 are affected by this vulnerability.

Devices supporting Bluetooth Mesh Profile Specification, versions 1.0 and 1.0.1, are affected by the following vulnerabilities:

#### Impersonation in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning

The Mesh Provisioning procedure could allow an attacker without knowledge of the AuthValue, spoofing a device being provisioned, to use crafted responses to appear to possess the AuthValue and to be issued a valid NetKey and potentially an AppKey (*CVE-2020-26560*). For this attack to be successful, an attacking device needs to be within wireless range of a Mesh Provisioner and either spoof the identity of a device being provisioned over the air or be directly provisioned onto a subnet controlled by the provisioner.

#### Predictable AuthValue in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning Leads to MITM

The Mesh Provisioning procedure could allow an attacker observing or taking part in the provisioning to brute force the AuthValue if it has a fixed value, or is selected predictably or with low entropy (*CVE-2020-26557*). Identifying the AuthValue generally requires a brute-force search against the provisioning random and provisioning confirmation produced by the Provisioner. This brute-force search, for a randomly selected AuthValue, must complete before the provisioning procedure times out, which can require significant resources. If the AuthValue is not selected randomly with each new provisioning attempt, then the brute-force search can occur offline and if successful, would permit an attacker to identify the AuthValue and authenticate to both the Provisioner and provisioned devices, permitting a MITM attack on a future provisioning attempts with the same AuthValue.

#### Malleable Commitment

The authentication protocol is vulnerable if the AuthValue can be identified during the provisioning procedure, even if the AuthValue is selected randomly (*CVE-2020-26556*). If an attacker can identify the AuthValue used before the provisioning procedure times out, it is possible to complete the provisioning operation and obtain a NetKey. Similar to CVE-2020-26557, identifying the AuthValue generally requires a brute-force search against the provisioning random and provisioning confirmation produced by the Provisioner. This brute-force search for a randomly selected AuthValue, which can require significant resources, must complete before the provisioning procedure times out.

#### AuthValue Leak

The Mesh Provisioning procedure could allow an attacker that was provisioned without access to the AuthValue to identify the AuthValue directly without brute-forcing its value (*CVE-2020-26559*). Even when a randomly generated AuthValue with a full 128-bits of entropy is used, an attacker acquiring the Provisionerâs public key, provisioning confirmation value, and provisioning random value, and providing its public key for use in the provisioning procedure, will be able to compute the AuthValue directly.

### Impact

#### Impersonation in the Passkey Entry Protocol

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to authenticate to the response victim device and act as a legitimate encrypted device. The attacker cannot pair with the initiating device using this method of attack, which prevents a fully transparent man-in-the-middle attack between the initiator and responder. For this attack to be successful, an attacking device needs to be within wireless range of two vulnerable Bluetooth devices that are initiating pairing or bonding for which a BR/EDR IO Capabilities exchange or LE IO Capability in the pairing request and response results in the selection of the Passkey pairing procedure.

#### Impersonation in the Pin Pairing Protocol

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to complete pairing with a known link key, encrypt communications with the vulnerable device, and access any profiles permitted by a paired or bonded remote device supporting Legacy Pairing.

#### Impersonation in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to successfully authenticate without the AuthValue. Once authenticated, the attacker could perform any operation permitted to a node provisioned on the subnet until it is either denied access or a new subnet is formed without the attacking node present.

#### Predictable AuthValue in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning Leads to MITM

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to successfully brute force the AuthValue and authenticate to both the Provisioner and provisioned devices, permitting a MITM attack on a future provisioning attempt with the same AuthValue.

#### Malleable Commitment

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain a NetKey, which could be used to decrypt and authenticate up to the network layer, allowing the relay of messages, but no application data decryption.

#### AuthValue Leak

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to compute the AuthValue and authenticate to the Provisioner and provisioned devices.

### Solution

Bluetooth users should ensure that they have installed the latest recommended updates from device and operating system manufacturers.

In addition to the two vulnerabilities affecting the Bluetooth Core Specification, the researchers also identified a potential security vulnerability related to LE Legacy Pairing authentication in Bluetooth Core Specification versions 4.0 through 5.2. The researchers claim that an attacker can reflect the confirmation and random numbers of a peer device in LE legacy pairing to successfully complete legacy authentication phase 2 without knowledge of the temporary key (TK). Because the attacker does not acquire a TK, or valid short-term key (STK) during this attack, completing authentication phase 2 is not sufficient for an encrypted link to be established. While the Bluetooth SIG does not consider this to be a method which can provide unauthorized access to a device, they still recommend that LE implementations requiring pairing and encryption use LE Secure Connections. The Bluetooth SIG also recommends that, where possible, implementations enable and enforce Secure Connections Only Mode, ensuring that LE legacy pairing cannot be used.

The Bluetooth SIG additionally makes the following [recommendations](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/key-attributes/bluetooth-security/reporting-security/) for each vulnerability:

#### Impersonation in the Passkey Entry Protocol

For the attack to succeed the pairing device needs to accept the same public key that it provided to the remote peer as the remote peerâs public key. The Bluetooth SIG recommends that potentially vulnerable implementations restrict the public keys accepted from a remote peer device to disallow a remote peer to present the same public key chosen by the local device, and the pairing procedure should be terminated with a failure status if this occurs.

#### Impersonation in the Pin Pairing Protocol

The Bluetooth SIG recommends that potentially vulnerable devices not initiate or accept connections from remote devices claiming the same BD\_ADDR as the local device. They also continue to recommend that devices use Secure Simple Pairing or BR/EDR Secure Connections to avoid known vulnerabilities with legacy BR/EDR pairing.

#### Impersonation in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning

The Bluetooth SIG recommends that potentially vulnerable mesh provisioners restrict the authentication procedure and not accept provisioning both random and confirmation numbers from a remote peer that are the same as those selected by the local device.

#### Predictable AuthValue in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning Leads to MITM

The Bluetooth SIG recommends that mesh implementations enforce a randomly selected AuthValue using all of the available bits, where permitted by the implementation. A large entropy helps ensure that a brute-force of the AuthValue, even a static AuthValue, cannot normally be completed in a reasonable time.

#### Malleable Commitment

The [statement from the Bluetooth SIG](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/key-attributes/bluetooth-security/malleable/) notes: "AuthValues selected using a cryptographically secure random or pseudorandom number generator and having the maximum permitted entropy (128-bits) will be most difficult to brute-force. AuthValues with reduced entropy or generated in a predictable manner will not grant the same level of protection against this vulnerability. Selecting a new AuthValue with each provisioning attempt can also make it more difficult to launch a brute-force attack by requiring the attacker to restart the search with each provisioning attempt."

#### AuthValue Leak

The Bluetooth SIG recommends that potentially vulnerable mesh provisioners use an out-of-band mechanism to exchange the public keys.

| **VU#799380.5** | Not Affected |

#### Vendor Statement

MikroTik Bluetooth implementation does not work in a peer-to-peer scenario, where pairing is involved. MikroTik devices work in Bluetooth Advertiser and Scanner topologies, where Bluetooth devices advertise/broadcast data over Bluetooth advertising channels, and MikroTik routers just scan the air to capture the Bluetooth payloads. Once again, there is no pairing involved. Pairing scenarios are scenarios where, for example, your phone connects to your headset, making a peer-to-peer connection between the two devices. In MikroTik's case, we do not support pairing, so it does not affect us.
MESH vulnerabilities also do not affect us, as MikroTik does not support this feature.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Debian Bug     : 986949 988352 989451

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service, or information leaks.

CVE-2020-24586, CVE-2020-24587, CVE-2020-26147

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that many Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not correctly implement reassembly
    of fragmented packets.  In some circumstances, an attacker within
    range of a network could exploit these flaws to forge arbitrary
    packets and/or to access sensitive data on that network.

CVE-2020-24588

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that most Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211, did not authenticate the "is
    aggregated" packet header flag.  An attacker within range of a
    network could exploit this to forge arbitrary packets on that
    network.

CVE-2020-25670, CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2021-23134

    kiyin (尹亮) of TenCent discovered several reference counting bugs
    in the NFC LLCP implementation which could lead to use-after-free.
    A local user could exploit these for denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    Nadav Markus and Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered that
    the original fixes for these introduced a new bug that could
    result in use-after-free and double-free.  This has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2020-25672

    kiyin (尹亮) of TenCent discovered a memory leak in the NFC LLCP
    implementation.  A local user could exploit this for denial of
    service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-26139

    Mathy Vanhoef discovered that a bug in some Wi-Fi implementations,
    including Linux's mac80211.  When operating in AP mode, they would
    forward EAPOL frames from one client to another while the sender
    was not yet authenticated.  An attacker within range of a network
    could use this for denial of service or as an aid to exploiting
    other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2020-26558, CVE-2021-0129

    Researchers at ANSSI discovered vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth
    Passkey authentication method, and in Linux's implementation of
    it.  An attacker within range of two Bluetooth devices while they
    pair using Passkey authentication could exploit this to obtain the
    shared secret (Passkey) and then impersonate either of the devices
    to each other.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

CVE-2021-3483

    马哲宇 (Zheyu Ma) reported a bug in the "nosy" driver for TI
    PCILynx FireWire controllers, which could lead to list corruption
    and a use-after-free.  On a system that uses this driver, local
    users granted access to /dev/nosy could exploit this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3506

    The ADLab of venustech discovered a bug in the F2FS driver which
    could lead to an out-of-bounds read when accessing a crafted
    filesystem.  A local user permitted to mount arbitrary filesystems
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash) or other
    security impact.

CVE-2021-3564, CVE-2021-3573, CVE-2021-32399

    The BlockSec team discovered several race conditions in the
    Bluetooth subsystem that could lead to a use-after-free or
    double-free.  A local user could exploit these to caue a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-3587

    Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a potential null
    pointer dereference in the NFC LLCP implementation.  A local user
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-23133

    Or Cohen of Palo Alto Networks discovered a race condition in the
    SCTP implementation, which can lead to list corruption.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28688 (XSA-371)

    It was discovered that the original fix for CVE-2021-26930
    (XSA-365) introduced a potential resource leak.  A malicious guest
    could presumably exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (resource exhaustion) within the host.

CVE-2021-28964

    Zygo Blaxell reported a race condition in the Btrfs driver which
    can lead to an assertion failure.  On systems using Btrfs, a local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-28971

    Vince Weaver reported a bug in the performance event handler for
    Intel PEBS.  A workaround for a hardware bug on Intel CPUs
    codenamed "Haswell" and earlier could lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  On systems with the affected CPUs, if users are
    permitted to access performance events, a local user may exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users do not have access to performance
    events, which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2021-29154

    It was discovered that the Extended BPF (eBPF) JIT compiler
    for x86_64 generated incorrect branch instructions in some
    cases.  On systems where eBPF JIT is enabled, users could
    exploit this to execute arbitrary code in the kernel.

    By default, eBPF JIT is disabled, mitigating this issue.  This is
    controlled by the net.core.bpf_jit_enable sysctl.

CVE-2021-29155, CVE-2021-31829

    Piotr Krysiuk and Benedict Schlueter discovered that the Extended
    BPF (eBPF) verifier did not completely protect against information
    leaks due to speculative execution.  A local user could exploit
    these to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2021-29264

    It was discovered that the "gianfar" Ethernet driver used with
    some Freescale SoCs did not correctly handle a Rx queue overrun
    when jumbo packets were enabled.  On systems using this driver and
    jumbo packets, an attacker on the network could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-29647

    The syzbot tool found an information leak in the Qualcomm IPC
    Router (qrtr) implementation.

    This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-29650

    It was discovered that a data race in the netfilter subsystem
    could lead to a null pointer dereference during replacement of a
    table.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user
    namespace could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    By default, unprivileged users cannot create user namespaces,
    which mitigates this issue.  This is controlled by the
    kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl.

CVE-2021-31916

    Dan Carpenter reported incorrect parameter validation in the
    device-mapper (dm) subsystem, which could lead to a heap buffer
    overrun.  However, only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability
    (i.e. root-equivalent) could trigger this bug, so it did not
    have any security impact in this kernel version.

CVE-2021-33034

    The syzbot tool found a bug in the Bluetooth subsystem that could
    lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.
