Okay, let's break down the information related to CVE-2020-26217 from the provided content.

**1.  Verification of CVE Relevance**

Based on the provided information from multiple sources, all documents clearly refer to CVE-2020-26217 and its related vulnerability within the XStream library.  Therefore, this content is **RELEVANT** to the specified CVE.

**2.  Extracted Vulnerability Information**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

    *   The vulnerability stems from XStream's deserialization process, where type information from the input stream is used to recreate objects. An attacker can manipulate this input stream by injecting or replacing objects to execute arbitrary shell commands.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

    *   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core weakness is that XStream, by default, allows the deserialization of types which can lead to arbitrary code execution when combined with a crafted input stream.
    *   **Blacklist Dependency:**  The default XStream security framework relies on a blacklist to block unsafe types, which is insufficient to prevent all possible attack vectors.  The exploit uses classes that are not part of the default blacklist at that time.
    *   **Missing Whitelist:** The primary recommendation is to move from the use of default blacklist to a strict whitelist.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**

    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server by manipulating the processed input stream.
    *   **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** As mentioned in the NetApp advisory, exploitation could also lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS), although the primary impact is Remote Code Execution.

*   **Attack Vectors:**

    *   **Manipulated Input Stream:** The attack vector involves manipulating the input stream (e.g., XML, JSON) provided to XStream during unmarshalling/deserialization.
    *   **Type Injection/Replacement:** Attackers can inject malicious types into the input stream.
   * **Data formats affected:** The issue is not limited to XML format, it can happen to any supported format (JSON, etc.).

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target application.
    *   **Control over input:** The attacker must be able to control the data that is passed to XStream to be deserialized.
    *   **Knowledge of vulnerable class:** The attacker needs to know and be able to craft input using one or more vulnerable classes that are not blacklisted.

**3. Technical Details and Descriptions (from x-stream.github.io and GHSA-mw36-7c6c-q4q2):**

*   **Reproducing the Vulnerability:** The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious XML or JSON payload that includes objects which, upon deserialization, lead to code execution. The provided example uses the following structure:
    ```xml
    <map>
      <entry>
        <jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString>
          <flags>0</flags>

            <dataHandler>
              <dataSource class='com.sun.xml.internal.ws.encoding.xml.XMLMessage$XmlDataSource'>

                        <expectedModCount>1</expectedModCount>
                        <outer-class>
                          <java.lang.ProcessBuilder>
                            <command>
                              <string>calc</string>
                            </command>
                          </java.lang.ProcessBuilder>
                        </outer-class>
                      </iter>
                      <filter class='javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter'>
                        <method>
                          <class>java.lang.ProcessBuilder</class>
                          <name>start</name>
                          <parameter-types/>
                        </method>
                        <name>start</name>
                      </filter>
                      <next/>
                    </iterator>
                    <type>KEYS</type>
                  </e>
                  <in class='java.io.ByteArrayInputStream'>
                    <buf></buf>
                    <pos>0</pos>
                    <mark>0</mark>
                    <count>0</count>
                  </in>
                </is>
                <consumed>false</consumed>
              </dataSource>
              <transferFlavors/>
            </dataHandler>
            <dataLen>0</dataLen>
          </value>
        </jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString>
        <string>test</string>
      </entry>
    </map>
    ```

   and demonstrates that this will execute the `calc` command when unmarshalled using XStream.

    *   The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting a `javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter` into an `java.util.Iterator` and then calling the `next()` method on the iterator which will execute the payload.

*   **Workarounds:**
    *   Using a strict whitelist with XStream's security framework is the recommended way to mitigate this risk.
    *   If a blacklist is used, explicitly deny `javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter` and `java.lang.ProcessBuilder`.
    *   Earlier versions may also require denying `java.beans.EventHandler`, `java.lang.Void` and `void`.
*   **Patched Versions:** XStream version 1.4.14 and greater include a fix to address the issue.
