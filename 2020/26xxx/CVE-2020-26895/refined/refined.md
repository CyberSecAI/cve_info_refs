Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26895:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly normalize ECDSA signatures to their low-S form within the Lightning Network Daemon (lnd).
- Specifically, when LND serializes signatures from a fixed-width representation to DER-encoded signatures, it bypasses the low-S normalization step present in the `btcec` library. This resulted in high-S DER signatures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Lack of Standardness Check:** LND was not verifying that signatures received from counter-parties conformed to transaction relay standardness, specifically the low-S rule, despite verifying consensus validity.
-   **Malleable Signatures:** The use of high-S ECDSA signatures creates a form of transaction malleability which allows a third party to modify the transaction ID.
-   **Inconsistent Signature Handling:** LND used `btcd.btcec.signature` for verifying counterparty signatures, which did not enforce the low-S rule, while Bitcoin Core and other implementations did.
-   **Bypassing Library Normalization:** LND had implemented its own serialization function (`Sig.ToSignatureBytes()`) which bypassed the `btcec` library's `Signature.Serialize()` method where low-S normalization was enforced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Loss of Funds:** An attacker could exploit this by providing a high-S signature in a channel update, which could cause a second-level HTLC-success transaction to be rejected by the mempool of the victim node. If the victim is unable to normalize the signature or use a third party to rebroadcast the transaction before the HTLC's CLTV (Check-Lock-Time-Verify) expires, the attacker could broadcast their HTLC-timeout transaction and recover the full value of the HTLC, minus fees.
-   **Transaction Relay Failure:** High-S signatures are considered non-standard and rejected by Bitcoin mempool policies. Thus, transactions with these signatures would not be relayed or mined.
-   **Denial of Service:** Although not explicitly a DoS, the inability to broadcast transactions due to non-standard signatures could cause a form of service disruption.
-   **Exploitation during force close**: The vulnerability is primarily exploitable during unilateral closure of channels. Cooperative closures would not be affected as full policy-aware verification is used for remote signatures during cooperative closes.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Peer:** Any peer with an open channel to a vulnerable LND node can exploit the vulnerability by providing high-S signatures in channel updates.
-   **Unilateral Channel Closure:** The primary exploitation vector is during a force close scenario, where the victim node attempts to broadcast a transaction using the counter-party's signature, which has been crafted with a high-S value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Open Lightning Channel:** The attacker must have an open Lightning channel with the victim node.
-   **Ability to Provide High-S Signature:** The attacker must be able to craft ECDSA signatures with a high-S value.
-   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must know that the victim node is vulnerable to the high-S signature malleability issue.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability was fixed in LND v0.10.0-beta by ensuring all witness construction methods use `btcec.Signature` to serialize signatures, thereby enforcing low-S normalization.
-   A patch allows for the normalization of high-S signatures to low-S ones, without any software changes, or via a third party.
-   The Lightning RFC lacked specifications on validating signatures according to both consensus and transaction relay standardness, which has been addressed in subsequent updates.
-   The issue underscores the need for a more explicit definition of tx-relay standardness across different implementations, especially in the context of layer 2 protocols.
-   The original vulnerability report and coordinated disclosure timeline provided additional context and analysis.
