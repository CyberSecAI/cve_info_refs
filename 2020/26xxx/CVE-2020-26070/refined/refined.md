Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-26070

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper resource allocation in the egress packet processing function of Cisco IOS XR Software when the device is operating in software switching mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper resource allocation leading to buffer exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause the affected device to exhaust its buffer resources.
- This results in the device becoming unable to process or forward network traffic, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The device requires a restart to restore full functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker can send specific streams of Layer 2 or Layer 3 protocol data units (PDUs).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers and Cisco Network Convergence System (NCS) 5000 Series Routers running vulnerable versions of Cisco IOS XR Software.
- The system log may contain the following message if buffer resources are exhausted:  `%PKT_INFRA-spp-4-PKT_ALLOC_FAIL : Failed to allocate n packets for sending`
- There are no workarounds available.
- Cisco has released software updates and SMUs (Software Maintenance Upgrades) to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during a Cisco TAC support case resolution.
