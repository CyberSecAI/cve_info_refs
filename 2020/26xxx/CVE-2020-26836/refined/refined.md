Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-26836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an open redirect issue found within the E2E Trace Analysis application of SAP Solution Manager 7.2. The application's servlet `/E2eTraceGatewayW/E2eTraceServlet` uses user information to gather logs. An attacker can inject a malicious URL as a parameter, which can then redirect a user to an untrusted site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site:** The primary weakness is the application's failure to properly validate or sanitize user-provided URLs, leading to a potential redirect to arbitrary sites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Theft:** Under certain conditions, an attacker may be able to steal the user's session cookie.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers could use this open redirect to trick users into entering credentials on a fake login page or downloading malware from a malicious site. This could impact the confidentiality of the service.
- **Credential Compromise:** By redirecting users to malicious sites, attackers can harvest user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes a redirect to a site they control, which is injected as a parameter to the vulnerable application URL.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker then shares this crafted URL with the target, tricking them into clicking on it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not require privileged access to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs containing malicious redirects, and be able to share it with the end-user.
