Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26272:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Electron routes IPC messages, specifically when dealing with out-of-process iframes (OOPIFs).  The `webContents.sendToFrame`, `event.reply`, and the `remote` module could deliver messages to the wrong frame in certain scenarios involving OOPIFs. The issue was due to using only `frameId` to identify the target frame, which could lead to collisions if multiple frames had the same ID across different processes.

*   **Weakness:** The core issue is an ID collision when routing IPC messages. The system was relying on a single integer `frameId` for identifying frames, which becomes problematic when frames have the same ID but reside in different processes. This leads to messages intended for one frame being delivered to another.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially manipulate the behavior of different frames within an Electron application. This could include:
    *   Interception of inter-frame communication.
    *   Injection of malicious content into the wrong frame.
    *   Circumventing expected application logic.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a specific scenario where an Electron application has multiple frames, at least one of which is an out-of-process iframe (OOPIF). The attacker can then send IPC messages using `webContents.sendToFrame`, `event.reply` or `remote` and have them misrouted to unintended frames due to the described ID collision.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the content of a frame, or the main process, to send messages via IPC using one of the vulnerable methods. 
    *   The attacker needs to understand how the target application creates and uses frames and sends IPC messages.
    *   The attacker would need to be in a position to exploit this within the context of a running Electron application.

**Technical Details**

*   **Affected Methods:** `webContents.sendToFrame`, `event.reply`, and the `remote` module were all affected by this vulnerability.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves modifying how Electron identifies frames by requiring a pair of numbers: `[processId, frameId]`.  The `sendToFrame` function was updated to accept either a single number representing the frame ID (for same-process frames) or a two-element array representing the `[processId, frameId]` (for cross-process frames). This ensures messages are routed correctly even when frame IDs overlap.
*   **Code Changes:** The provided diffs show changes to:
    *   `docs/api/structures/ipc-main-event.md` and `docs/api/structures/ipc-main-invoke-event.md` : Documenting the `processId`.
    *   `docs/api/web-contents.md`:  Documenting the new `frameId` parameter format for `sendToFrame`.
    *   `lib/browser/api/web-contents.ts`:  Modifying the `sendToFrame` function to accept `frameId` as number or array, and adding `processId` to `event.reply`.
    *   `lib/browser/remote/server.ts`: Updating `frameId` type and unwrapArgs.
    *   `shell/browser/api/electron_api_web_contents.cc` and `shell/browser/api/electron_api_web_contents.h`: Changing how messages are routed to frames with the new parameter format.
    *   `shell/common/gin_helper/event_emitter.cc`: Adding processId to the event.
    *   `spec-main/api-ipc-main-spec.ts`: Added a test to ensure replies work correctly.
    *   `spec-main/fixtures/snapshots/proxy-window-open.snapshot.txt` and `spec-main/guest-window-manager-spec.ts`: Adjustments to tests using placeholders for the added processId.
    *   `typings/internal-electron.d.ts`: Types for the new frameId parameter format.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Electron versions >=9.0.0-beta.0 and < 9.4.0
*   Electron versions >=10.0.0-beta.0 and < 10.2.0
*   Electron versions >=11.0.0-beta.0 and < 11.1.0
*   Electron versions >=12.0.0-beta.0 and < 12.0.0-beta.9
*   Electron versions <=8

**Patched Versions:**

*   9.4.0
*   10.2.0
*   11.1.0
*   12.0.0-beta.9

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as "moderate" severity.
*   There are no workarounds, requiring an upgrade to a patched version.
*   The fix involves a change to the API regarding `frameId` parameter for `sendToFrame`.
