Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26211:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-provided HTML content within the BookStack application. Specifically, the application failed to properly handle `javascript:` URIs in links and forms, as well as meta tags that could cause redirects.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application was vulnerable to XSS attacks by allowing users to inject malicious JavaScript code via `javascript:` URIs in `<a>` tags and `<form>` actions/formactions attributes.
*   **Open Redirect:**  A user could insert a `<meta>` tag with a `url` content attribute to force a redirect to an arbitrary external URL upon page load, potentially leading to phishing attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the application, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Open Redirect:**  Successful exploitation could redirect users to malicious websites without their knowledge, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware downloads.

**Attack vectors:**

The primary attack vector is through the page content editor within the BookStack application. An attacker with edit permissions can inject the malicious code directly into the HTML content of a page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Edit permissions:** The attacker needs to have permission to edit pages within the BookStack instance. This means they would need to be a registered user with the appropriate level of access.
*   **Understanding of HTML:** The attacker must know how to write HTML that uses the vulnerable attributes (`href`, `action`, `formaction`, and `content` in meta tags) to inject malicious code.

**Additional Details**
The provided content also includes:
- SQL queries to identify potentially exploited instances of the vulnerability.
- Commit details including code changes for `PageContent.php` and `PageContentTest.php` that show how the vulnerability was patched.
