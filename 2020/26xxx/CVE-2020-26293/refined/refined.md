Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26293:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content directly mentions CVE-2020-26293 in the security advisory for `HtmlSanitizer`.
   - It clearly states that the vulnerability is related to a possible XSS bypass.
   - The vulnerability exists when the `<style>` tag is explicitly allowed.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from how the `HtmlSanitizer` library processes and sanitizes CSS within the `<style>` tag when it is explicitly allowed.
   - The library failed to properly escape certain characters, specifically the `<` character in the CSS content, within the `<style>` tag.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The core weakness is the inadequate sanitization of CSS content when the `<style>` tag is permitted.
   - **XSS vulnerability:** An attacker can inject malicious script by crafting a style tag containing escaped characters which when rendered in browser leads to executing JavaScript code

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser, leading to:
     - Session hijacking
     - Data theft
     - Defacement of the website
     - Redirection to malicious sites

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious HTML Input:** An attacker crafts malicious HTML input with a style tag containing unescaped characters, that when parsed, leads to JavaScript execution.
   - **Injection Point:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting the crafted HTML through any user input that is processed by the vulnerable `HtmlSanitizer` library with the `<style>` tag allowed.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Ability to Inject HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to inject arbitrary HTML into an application that uses the vulnerable `HtmlSanitizer` library with the `<style>` tag allowed.
   - **Understanding of Sanitizer Bypass:** The attacker needs to craft an input that specifically exploits the sanitizer's weakness in handling the `<style>` tag by using escaped characters.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Versions of HtmlSanitizer prior to 5.0.372 are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.0.372 and later.
*   **Workaround:** The provided workaround is to remove the `<style>` tag from the set of allowed tags.
*   **Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered by Micha≈Ç Bentkowski of Securitum.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate".
*   The fix involves replacing the `<` character with `\3c` in the CSS content within the `<style>` tag.

This detailed analysis provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, its causes, impact, and how it can be exploited.
