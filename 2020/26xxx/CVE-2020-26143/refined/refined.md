Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-26143:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper handling of fragmented plaintext data frames within a protected Wi-Fi network. Specifically, vulnerable implementations accept fragmented plaintext frames even when connected to an encrypted network, which should not occur under normal circumstances.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper input validation on received Wi-Fi frames. Implementations should reject plaintext fragments in protected networks but fail to do so.
*   **Missing Security Checks:** The vulnerability exists because the receiving devices do not check if fragmented frames received in a protected network are encrypted or not, and accept plaintext fragments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Packet Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary data frames by sending them as plaintext fragments.
*   **Bypass Network Security:** This can bypass Wi-Fi encryption, allowing the attacker to inject malicious payloads.
*   **Potential Data Manipulation and Theft**: Although not directly stated, the ability to inject packets can be a first step in more serious attacks. As seen with other vulnerabilities, the attacker could perform a DNS poisoning attack and steal sensitive information over unencrypted HTTP.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Network:** The attack requires the attacker to be within Wi-Fi range of the targeted network.
*   **Wireless Medium:** The attack is executed by sending malicious Wi-Fi frames over the air.
*   **Fragmented Plaintext frames:** The vulnerability is specific to accepting fragmented data frames that are not encrypted

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker must be within the wireless range of the vulnerable Wi-Fi network.
*   **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send custom fragmented plaintext 802.11 frames, to inject malicious data.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to the Wi-Fi network, as the vulnerability lies in how the device processes received frames *after* any potential authentication has occurred.

**Additional notes:**
*   This vulnerability is related to the "FragAttacks" set of vulnerabilities discovered in 802.11 implementations.
*   The vulnerability is present in some Wi-Fi clients and access points implementations (depending on the device).

This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-26140, but CVE-2020-26143 is specific to *fragmented* plaintext frames.
