Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Insufficient access authorization within the xAPI service of Cisco Telepresence CE and RoomOS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the xAPI service's failure to properly restrict access when generating tokens. An authenticated user can generate a token with elevated privileges.
*   CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can generate an access token that allows them to enable experimental features on the affected device. These features should not be available to regular users.
*   The generated tokens could potentially lead to further unauthorized actions or access to sensitive functionalities, depending on the experimental features that are enabled.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Remote attacker
*   Exploitation occurs through the xAPI service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated to the system. This means they would need valid credentials for the affected device.
*   The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable xAPI service.
*   The attacker needs to send a specific request to the xAPI service to generate a specific token

**CVSS Score:**

*   CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   Base Score: 5.5 (Medium)

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco Telepresence CE Software
*   Cisco RoomOS Software
*   Specific vulnerable releases are detailed in the advisory.

**Mitigation:**

*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   Cisco RoomOS Software was patched through a cloud-based update (RoomOS July Drop 1 2020).

**Additional Notes:**

*   There are no known workarounds.
*   The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
*   Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
