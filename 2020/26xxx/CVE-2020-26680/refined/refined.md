Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities discovered in the virtual event platforms, specifically webcasts.com (and its integrated customer 6Connex) and VFairs, as described in the Huntress blog post:

**Vulnerabilities in webcasts.com (via 6Connex):**

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Information Disclosure: User data, including names, company and title, emails, IP addresses, and potentially city, state, phone number, and physical address, was exposed through attendee IDs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   PII leakage and potential misuse of personal data. Attackers could potentially access this data for all users at the event and possibly other events on the same platform.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attending an event on the platform.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attending any event using the vulnerable platform, basic understanding of how to find attendee IDs.

**Vulnerabilities in VFairs (version 3.33):**

*   **Root Cause:** Software flaws and misconfigurations.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Profile Manipulation: The ability to change not only their own profile, but through manipulating ID numbers, change other users' profiles too.
    *   Cross-site scripting (XSS): By changing profile information, a malicious actor could inject XSS attacks.
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): The ability to upload PHP code through profile picture upload, instead of just image files.
    *   SQL Injection: Vulnerable to time-based blind SQL injection, with public SQL database errors.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Profile manipulation of other users.
    *   XSS attacks to steal user cookies, impersonate users or redirect browsers.
    *   Remote code execution, enabling attackers to take control of the server and website.
    *   Direct access to the database.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Attending an event on the platform and accessing the profile editing features.
*    **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attending any event using the vulnerable platform and ability to manipulate ID numbers in the requests.

**Additional Points:**
*   The article mentions that the vulnerabilities in VFairs were patched in version 3.34.
*   Huntress responsibly disclosed the issues to both VFairs and 6Connex. 6Connex responded quickly, while VFairs initially did not respond for three weeks.
*   The blog post discusses a larger issue of supply chain risk using the example of Axial, where 250k+ confidential details on SMB mergers and acquisitions were leaked.
*   The article highlights that these issues are unfortunately common and stresses the importance of vetting third-party solutions before using them.
