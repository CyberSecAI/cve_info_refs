### 13.12.131200 - May 25, 2022

###### New Features:

* **Attaching external files to comments.** User can attach external files (e.g., screenshots, logs, etc.) to the comments. Attachments are added as links to the text of comments. When a user clicks on the attachment’s link and Collaborator can render attached content, then Collaborator displays the context in the new tab of Web browser. Otherwise, Collaborator suggests to download the attached file. Files of restricted types cannot be attached. User can delete the attachment by editing comment. (COLLAB-2710, COLLAB-9351)

###### Improvements:

* **Add triggers for review/files deletion** (COLLAB-9284). Possibility to configure triggers for ‘Review Deleted’ And ‘Deleted Files’ event was added. It’s posisble now to confugure execution of external scripts or applications on these events, similar as it works for ‘Review Created’ and ‘Added Files’ events.
* **Emails and usernames are used to map group members.** When [syncing groups and their members with GitLab server](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/groups/sync.html#GitLabSync), Collaborator now compares usernames and email addresses in addition to full names to find the matching users. (COLLAB-9121)
* **Perforce:** Ignore duplicated base versions for pending changes in the Diff Viewer (COLLAB-9220)
* **Notify the review participants that the review materials are being uploaded.** Notification pop-up ‘Files are being uploaded. Please wait.’ was added for Review page.

* **Ability to change participant role to author if user upload review materials.**  An option Make user review’s author on review materials upload' was added to Admin/System/Review Process. If set to Yes, then any review participant, who uploads review materials, is automatically set as author for the review. Default value is No, that is current behavior (COLLAB-9373, COLLAB-9351)
* **Optimize Global Search to reduce load on DB:** Search, that user can start from Web UI header, was optimized to reduce load on DB (COLLAB-9231)
* **Installation process improved to allow disable some action.**

  Now on the final screen of [server installer](/collaborator/docs/server/install/steps.html), you can specify whether to register Collaborator as a service (that is, as operating system's background process), start this service after the install, and whether to open the server's URL in web browser. (COLLAB-8761)

###### Bug Fixes:

* ‘Email All’ doesn't include review pool participants (COLLAB-9382)

* IndexOutOfBoundsException during Excel cell locator promotion (COLLAB-9362)
### 13.11.131101 - March 29, 2022

###### Improvements:

* **Mapping pull request authors by email.** Some repository hosting services do not provide e-mail addresses of pull request authors, even when source-control users made them public. Thus Collaborator could fail to find a user matching to pull request author. Now, in this case Collaborator would retrieve the author of pull request’s last commit and assign the matching Collaborator user as a review author and creator. (COLLAB-8908)
* The name of department was added as possible SAML assertion parameter. When this parameter is included in single sign-on server response, Collaborator will now synchronize user's department name with the SSO server. (COLLAB-9021)
* Improvements to storing document's number of converted pages to avoid issues with blocked queries to filemetrics table. (COLLAB-9277)

###### Bug Fixes:

* In some cases, participants are getting added to the same review twice. (COLLAB-9314)
* Newly added file was not highlighted as new in “All changes” mode when several revisions of that file were uploaded to review. (COLLAB-9229)
* Conversation pane scrolled to the top after interactions with comments/defects. (COLLAB-9257)
* Version identifiers were displayed partially when the review detailed report was exported as PDF. (COLLAB-9267)
* A “New Revision Available” notification could destroy not-yet-submitted comment. (COLLAB-9230)
### 13.11.131100 - February 21, 2022

###### New Features

* **By character comparison of cell text.** When reviewing spreadsheets, you can now enable by character comparison of text inside the cells. This feature would be helpful when the content of the cell has big portions of text and allows to highlight the exact text fragments that were changed inside the cell.

  [![Highlighting cell differences with «By characters» Diff Cell method](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/131100/131100_diff_cells_by_chars.png "Highlighting cell differences with «By characters» Diff Cell method")](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/131100/131100_diff_cells_by_chars.png)

  Click the image to enlarge it.

  To learn more about cell content comparison and highlighting, see the [*Cell content difference*](/collaborator/docs/working-with/materials/spreadsheets.html#cell-content-difference) section of [Reviewing spreadsheets](/collaborator/docs/working-with/materials/spreadsheets.html). (COLLAB-8773, COLLAB-9204)
* **Templates for review titles.** You can now specify default titles for the reviews in the [template settings](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/review-templates/index.html#review-title-templates). The title text could contain [variables](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/variable-substitution.html), for example, `${review.creator.name}` or `${pullrequest.title}`. (COLLAB-7335)

###### Simulink Integration Improvements:

* **Floating-seat licenses.** In previous versions, [Simulink integration licenses](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/licensing.html#about-simulink-integration-licenses) were of fixed-seat type: could only be assigned to particular Collaborator users. Now it become possible to purchase a floating-seat Simulink integration license and have a pool of users who can concurrently review Simulink models. (COLLAB-8920)
* When reviewing Simulink models, it became possible to [highlight blocks whose nested elements were changed](/collaborator/docs/reference/ui/diff-viewer.html#simulink-models). (COLLAB-8925)
* Simulink models exported as web view archive have a number of helper files that common for any model. Collaborator now stores these common files separately and re-uses them between different models and model revisions. (COLLAB-8504)

###### Repository Hosting Service Integration Improvements:

* **Migrating remote repositories.** Some remote repository hosting systems support migrating their repositories (including their pull requests) from one server instance to another. Now Collaborator supports migrating of an existing repository hosting integration to a new URL. To learn about the migration procedure and when it can be used see [Migrating remote repositories](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/migrating-remote-repositories.html). (COLLAB-9099)
* Now integrations do not allow to complete reviews when the respective pull requests have file conflicts. This behavior is enabled by default and is controlled by the Allow to complete review with conflicts in pull request setting. (COLLAB-8702)
* When the pull request is closed or deleted, the integration now automatically closes the corresponding review. Reviews in planning phase will be deleted, while in progress reviews will be cancelled. (COLLAB-3839)

###### More Improvements:

* **Improved processing of broken revisions.** When some file or file revision could not be converted successfully, Collaborator now posts a warning to the review chat and to server log, It also does not calculate differences and does not allow adding comments and defects for this revision. (COLLAB-9196)
* Migrated Collaborator logging framework from Log4j to Logback. This improves system stability and resolves recent vulnerabilities found in Log4j. Among other benefits of Logback framework is that changes made to [log configurations](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/logging.html) are applied instantly, without need to restart Collaborator server. (COLLAB-9138)
* Updated API commands that change template's name, description and workflow setting to apply these changes without disabling existing template. (COLLAB-9148, COLLAB-2143)
* Loading indicator is now displayed in the Defect Log section while retrieving information about defects. This is especially useful for large reviews where it can take significant time to get the defects. (COLLAB-8910)
* When uploading files to the review, Collaborator now appends their file-names to the ccollab.log file. (COLLAB-8307)
* Template subscriptions (user-based and group-based) are now retained when the template was modified. (COLLAB-6666)
* Added CORS filter to Collaborator server to avoid cross-site request forgery. (COLLAB-9151)
* Updated the embedded Hypersonic database (HSQL) to version 2.5.2 to resolve a number of performance and security issues. (COLLAB-6488)
* The `ccollab admin find review` command now can search for reviews having the specified ID. (COLLAB-5872)

###### Bug Fixes:

* The "Merge commit title" field was still visible when selecting the "Squash and merge" strategy for the review. (COLLAB-9235)
* Reviews created from GitLab merge requests could not be viewed in Collaborator 13.10. (COLLAB-9189)
* When automatically creating reviews for Simulink models from Git repositories, an exception could occur if the Simulink model was larger than 1 Mb. (COLLAB-9186)
* Collaborator server could not be updated from versions 12.x to 13.x if remote repository integrations were configured. (COLLAB-9182)
* Issues with checklists processing in templates were fixed. (COLLAB-9160, COLLAB-9159, COLLAB-9150)
* Jira integration did not work properly if the project key contained underscore characters. (COLLAB-9077)
* The Display Changes selector of Diff Viewer did not show correct changes when uploading the same ClearCase Activity into a review. (COLLAB-8961)
* LOC metrics were not calculated for the reviews where empty changelists were manually deleted. (COLLAB-8719)
* Diff Viewer could not open Word file if it had the "track changes" mode enabled and contains a huge number of changes and deletions. (COLLAB-8641)
### 13.10.131004 - March 22, 2022

###### Improvements:

* **Mapping pull request authors by email.** Some repository hosting services do not provide e-mail addresses of pull request authors, even when source-control users made them public. Thus Collaborator could fail to find a user matching to pull request author. Now, in this case Collaborator would retrieve the author of pull request’s last commit and assign the matching Collaborator user as a review author and creator. (COLLAB-8908)
* The name of department was added as possible SAML assertion parameter. When this parameter is included in single sign-on server response, Collaborator will now synchronize user's department name with the SSO server. (COLLAB-9021)
* Improvements to storing document's number of converted pages to avoid issues with blocked queries to filemetrics table. (COLLAB-9277)

###### Bug Fixes:

* In some cases, the same user was added to the review twice, thus preventing it from completion. (COLLAB-9314)
* Conversation pane scrolled to the top after interactions with comments/defects. (COLLAB-9257)
* Version identifiers were displayed partially when the review detailed report was exported as PDF. (COLLAB-9267)
* A “New Revision Available” notification could destroy not-yet-submitted comment. (COLLAB-9230)
### 13.10.131003 - February 7, 2022

###### Bug Fixes:

* Collaborator server could not be updated from versions 12.x to 13.x if remote repository integrations were configured. (COLLAB-9182)
* LOC metrics were not calculated for the reviews where empty changelists were manually deleted. (COLLAB-8719)
* Jira integration did not work properly if the project key contained underscore characters. (COLLAB-9077)
* The "Merge commit title" field was still visible when selecting the "Squash and merge" strategy for the review. (COLLAB-9235)
* When automatically creating reviews for Simulink models from Git repositories, an exception could occur if the Simulink model was larger than 1 Mb. (COLLAB-9186)
### 13.10.131002 - January 24, 2022

###### Improvements:

* Updated API commands that change template's name, description and workflow setting to apply these changes without disabling existing template. (COLLAB-9148, COLLAB-2143)

###### Bug Fixes:

* Reviews created from GitLab merge requests could not be viewed in Collaborator 13.10. (COLLAB-9189)
* Issues with checklists processing in templates were fixed. (COLLAB-9160, COLLAB-9159, COLLAB-9150)
### 13.10.131001 - December 30, 2021

###### Improvements:

* Migrated Collaborator logging framework from Log4j to Logback. This improves system stability and resolves recent vulnerabilities found in Log4j. Among other benefits of Logback framework is that changes made to [log configurations](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/logging.html) are applied instantly, without need to restart Collaborator server. (COLLAB-9138)
### 13.10.131000 - December 17, 2021

###### New Features

* **Projects.** Collaborator 13.10 introduces the concept of projects. Projects are a high-level way to group reviews, that represent different artifacts, but still relate to some common entity: product, application, product area, change-set. For example, one project could host product requirements documents, design documents, source code files, test cases and marketing materials.

  [![Project Screen in Web Client](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/131000/131000-ws-project-screen.png "Project Screen in Web Client")](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/131000/131000-ws-project-screen.png)

  Click the image to enlarge it.

  To create and manage projects: add participants who can access project, add reviews belonging to the project and so on, new [Project](/collaborator/docs/reference/ui/projects.html) and [Project Screen](/collaborator/docs/reference/ui/project-screen/index.html) pages were added to CollaboratorWeb Client. (COLLAB-5322)
* **Assign defects to particular user** In reviews having multiple authors, it could be useful, to specify a particular author who is responsible for fixing the particular defect. Starting from Collaborator 13.10 this ability could be enabled in [template settings](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/review-templates/index.html#allow-assign-defects-to-review-participant). In this case, when creating defect you can specify the exact participant who should be responsible for fixing it. (COLLAB-3244, COLLAB-9046)

###### Repository Hosting Service Integration Improvements:

* **Select merge strategies for pull requests on review completion.** In addition to merging pull requests when the review was accomplished, it now became possible to perform other actions like squash and merge, rebase and merge, merge and fast forward and so on. The exact list of available strategies depends on selected repository hosting service. Default merge strategy is specified by the integration’s When review completed setting. (COLLAB-4640)
* **Ability to change merge strategy in separate reviews.** For reviews created by [repository hosting service integrations](/collaborator/docs/source-control/repo-hosting/index.html) new [Pull Request Merge Info](/collaborator/docs/reference/ui/review-screen/pull-request-merge-info.html) section will be displayed in the Review Screen. This section allows to check and change what action will be performed with pull request when the current review will be accomplished. Merge strategy selected in Pull Request Merge Info section overrides the integration's default merge strategy. (COLLAB-4640, COLLAB-1900)

  [![Pull Request Merge Info section in Web Client](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/131000/131000-pull-request-merge-info.png "Pull Request Merge Info section in Web Client")](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/131000/131000-pull-request-merge-info.png)

  Click the image to enlarge it.
* **Notify authors when pull request could not be merged automatically.** If remote repository integrations fail to automatically merge pull request, Collaborator now notifies the authors of the respective review, so that they can resolve the issue manually. (COLLAB-8938)
* Support for new format of GitLab authentication tokens. (COLLAB-9120)

###### More Improvements:

* Process of updating template settings from the Workflow settings section was optimized. Now changes made to these settings of the template could be applied to all related reviews immediately. That is, if only Workflow settings were changed, template is not disabled and there is no need to re-apply template in the reviews. (COLLAB-9086)
* Collaborator now allows uploading Simulink models from remote repositories even when MathWorks MATLAB is not installed on Collaborator server. In this case it uploads models as binary files and displays a warning that Simulink models cannot be reviewed as [MATLAB is not configured on Collaborator server](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/auto-create-simulink-reviews.html). (COLLAB-9006)

Thus it would be much more easier to figure out who changed what setting within Collaborator. (COLLAB-6232)
* **Support for HTTP Strict Transport Security.** Now Collaborator administrators could [enable the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/https.html#enable-hsts) policy mechanism to mitigate the risk of man in the middle attacks. (COLLAB-5369)
* Now Collaborator supports the OAuth 2.0 protocol for sending e-mail notifications. To use that, your Collaborator administrators should [enable the respective option](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/email.html#enable-oauth2) and then specify access token instead of regular SMTP password. (COLLAB-8232)
* Increased the length of the SMTP Password field. (COLLAB-6234)
* Updated Apache Tomcat server to version 9.0.44 to resolve a number of performance and security issues. (COLLAB-8365)
* Updated JQuery library to version 3.6.0 to resolve a number of performance and security issues. (COLLAB-8354)
* Collaborator now supports Tomcat JDBC Connection Pool factory for [obfuscating database passwords](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/security.html#passwords). (COLLAB-8444)
* [Reviewing of live URLs](/collaborator/docs/working-with/materials/urls.html) could now be enabled or disabled through [server option](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/general.html#allow-upload-url). (COLLAB-8416)

###### Performance improvements:

* Optimized and reduced number of calls to Notification and Todo database tables. (COLLAB-8270, COLLAB-8268)

### 13.6.13601 - May 25, 2021

###### Improvements:

* **Compute Simulink model diffs on the server side.** Now Collaborator calculates differences in Simulink model revisions on the server. This improves the overall performance: Collaborator computes differences only once and doesn’t need to send files to every client. (COLLAB-8360)

### 13.6.13600 - April 22, 2021

###### New Features

* **Review Simulink models.** With Collaborator version 13.6 it became possible to [review MathWorks Simulink models](/collaborator/docs/working-with/materials/simulink.html) that are exported as web view archives.

  [![Reviewing Simulink models](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13600/13600-simulink-diffs.png "Reviewing Simulink models")](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13600/13600-simulink-diffs.png)

  Click the image to enlarge it.

  To use the feature, you should have Collaborator Enterprise edition and also have to obtain additional Simulink integration licenses from SmartBear and assign them to Collaborator users. (COLLAB-1489)
* **Collaborator Simulink Reviewer App.**This application facilitates performing Simulink model reviews. It is installed as plug-in into MathWorks Simulink and allows uploading models to Collaborator server directly form Simulink. (COLLAB-8078)

  [![Simulink Reviewer App](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13600/13600-simulink-app-upload-model.png "Simulink Reviewer App")](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13600/13600-simulink-app-upload-model.png)

  Click the image to enlarge it.

###### More improvements:

* **Cross-page scrolling in document reviews.** In previous versions, when reviewing documents, the Diff Viewer displayed only one page per revision. Now it can show multiple pages simultaneously (for example, the end of the current page and the beginning of the next page). (COLLAB-4855)
* **Cache for document reviews.** Now Collaborator can cache previously opened documents in order to display them quickly when you reopen them. Caching is on by default and is controlled by the [`com.smartbear.diff.image.cache`](/collaborator/docs/reference/java-vm-options.html) VM option. (COLLAB-8039)
* **History of file renames.** Now, when [uploading file revisions under a different name](/collaborator/docs/working-with/misc-tasks/different-filenames-same-document.html), the history of file renames is listed in the review's [Chat](/collaborator/docs/reference/ui/review-screen/overall-chat.html) section. (COLLAB-8210)

  ![History of file renames](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13600/13600-revison-renames-list.png)
  History of file renames
* **Database performance improvements.** We have re-factored and improved our data access mechanisms to reduce number of calls to database and level up data cashing. (COLLAB-8162, COLLAB-8266, COLLAB-8267)
* Improved how Diff Viewer highlights additions and removal of entire columns when reviewing spreadsheets. Now inserting and removing of entire columns with content will be interpreted as inserting/removing a series of cells. Whereas inserting and removing of entire columns and modifying nearby cells will still be interpreted as modifying a series of cells. (COLLAB-8278)

###### Bug Fixes:

* fixed - If the Allow users to move comments server setting was enabled, comments could move themselves sporadically in some cases. (COLLAB-8323)
* fixed - Excel file revision where cells of entire row have been merged could not be displayed after upgrade to 13.5.13500. (COLLAB-8306)

### 13.5.13500 - February 26, 2021

###### New Features

* **Different file names for the same document.** For manually uploaded files it became possible to [upload their new revisions under a different file name](/collaborator/docs/working-with/misc-tasks/different-filenames-same-document.html). For example, you can upload a file named - my\_file1.doc and then upload its revised version as my\_file2.doc, or as my\_file\_Johns\_version.doc, or whatever other name. (COLLAB-1846)

  ![Uploading new revision under a different file name.](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13500/13500-different-filenames-same-document.gif)

###### More improvements:

* **Support 'Mark All Read' on the review materials level.** The [Review Materials](/collaborator/docs/reference/ui/review-screen/review-materials.html) section of Web Client got a new button that allows to mark all comments in all review materials as read. Since this operation makes it extremely easy for someone to mark all comments as read without actually reading them, this action should be enabled by Collaborator administrators via the [respective option](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/general.html#allow-mark-all-read-in-review-materials). (COLLAB-7551)
* **Support merge request pipelines for GitLab.** If your GitLab repository is configured to use [merge request pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/merge_request_pipelines/), Collaborator integration will use them as well. (COLLAB-8154)
* Now Collaborator updates user email address, first name and last name from the SAML server, when [syncing user membership with a SAML SSO server](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/single-sign-on/saml.html#SAML-group-synch). (COLLAB-7897)
* Updated the JavaMail library to 1.6.2 in order to use the TLSv1.2 protocol by default. (COLLAB-7891)
* When changing a review group, Collaborator will now retain existing template and filled-in checklist items if the template/checklist is available to the newly selected group. (COLLAB-7445)

###### Bug Fixes:

* fixed - Reports returned blank values for the LOC metrics. (COLLAB-8151)
* fixed - The Azure DevOps integration was trying to search for workitems only in the "DefaultCollection" collection. (COLLAB-8126)
* fixed - DiffViewer did not open a review if it contained invalid checklist item identifier. (COLLAB-8124)
* fixed - Running the `ccollab admin review-xml` command caused "Error accessing URL". (COLLAB-8109)
* fixed - The Comments panel was displayed incorrectly for the files uploaded from Subversion or linked as live URLs. (COLLAB-8106)
* fixed - An error appeared in the timeline report if the user deleted the review's author from the list of subscriptions. (COLLAB-8105)
* fixed - Remote system cache statistics could be absent in logs on certain JDK's. (COLLAB-8072)
* fixed - If the TFS workspace location was set to "Server" in the Visual Studio settings, the "Condition must not be false" error appeared when trying to add changes. (COLLAB-8060)
* fixed - The Azure DevOps integration failed to map VisualStudio.com repository if it contained the DefaultCollections portion in URL. (COLLAB-8049)
* fixed - A new incoming comment could destroy not-yet-submitted comment. (COLLAB-8028)
* fixed - An exception could occur in the Eclipse plug-in while opening reviews that were created by copying previous reviews. (COLLAB-8023)
* fixed - When entering a comment of a certain length in a conversation, the top line of text could become obscured. (COLLAB-8006)
* fixed - Merged cells caused incorrect cell identification. (COLLAB-7983)
* fixed - The top-most row could sometimes become misaligned with the rest of the rows when reviewing spreadsheets. (COLLAB-7982)
* fixed - The "Email All" feature did not launch an email client if the list of email addresses exceeded 1752 characters. (COLLAB-5455)
* fixed - Long review title could affect the logic of sending the approaching deadline notifications. (COLLAB-4208)
### 13.4.13402 - January 26, 2021

### 13.4.13401 - January 15, 2021

* fixed - The Comments panel was displayed incorrectly for the files uploaded from Subversion or linked as live URLs. (COLLAB-8106)
### 13.4.13400 - December 30, 2020

###### New Features

* **Mention other users in comments and defects.** Now you can type the @ character followed by user login or display name to mention a user in comment or defect. When you submit your comment or defect, Collaborator sends an e-mail and in-app notifications, so that mentioned users may check the corresponding comment or defect. (COLLAB-3321)

  ![Typing-in a user mention](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13400/13400-user-mentioning.png)
* **Auto-polling for new repositories.** Previous versions of Collaborator are able to create integrations for various existing [remote server repositories](/collaborator/docs/source-control/repo-hosting/index.html). Yet, when new repositories were created on a remote server, Collaborator administrators were not aware of them. Now administrators may configure Collaborator server to [automatically check if any new repositories have been added](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/repo-hosting.html#Repository-Auto-Polling) in tracked remote servers and be notified of these new repositories. So they can integrate newly created repositories with little or no delay. (COLLAB-7719)
* **In-app notifications.** The top toolbar of Web Client is now able to display some of user-related notifications. Namely, it displays when the user was mentioned in some review, or when new repositories have been added in tracked remote servers. (COLLAB-7787)

  ![User in-app notification](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13400/13400-in-app-notifications.png)
* **Generating login tickets.** Now Collaborator users can [generate login tickets](/collaborator/docs/web-client/manage-acc/user-prefs.html#login-ticket-authentication) themselves. Login tickets are special alpha-numeric identifiers that act as user credentials for a limited time period. By default, tickets are valid for 30 days. Collaborator administrators can [decrease or increase ticket's time-to-live](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/general.html#login-ticket-time-to-live).

  To obtain a ticket, go to the Account information tab of User Preferences, press Generate Login Ticket and copy the resulting alpha-numeric identifier. Now you can specify it instead of password in Collaborator desktop clients. (COLLAB-7919)
* **Single sign-on support for desktop clients.** To use [desktop clients](/collaborator/docs/desktop-clients/index.html) (GUI Client, Command-Line Client), [Office plug-ins](/collaborator/docs/desktop-clients/office-plugins/index.html) and [IDE plug-ins](/collaborator/docs/ide-clients/index.html) (Visual Studio Extension, Eclipse Plug-in) when [single sign-on authentication](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/single-sign-on/index.html) is enabled, users should [generate login tickets](/collaborator/docs/web-client/manage-acc/user-prefs.html#login-ticket-authentication) and specify them in client connection settings instead of password. (COLLAB-7916)
* **Version info in comments and defects.** Conversation panes for file comments and defects now display information about the specific revision where that comment or defect was made. For files from source-control systems, the version information link displays the commit ID, whereas for locally uploaded files it displays the upload number. (COLLAB-5422)

  | Version info for source-control filesVersion info for source-control files | Version info for local filesVersion info for local files |
  | --- | --- |
* **Support for GitHub teams in pull request reviewers and Code owners.** If some [team](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team%40latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-teams) was added as reviewer when creating pull request on the GitHub side, or some team was specified in [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team%40latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners) file, Collaborator's GitHub integration tries to match members of that team with Collaborator users and can automatically add those users as reviewers on Collaborator side. (COLLAB-7838)

###### More improvements:

* **Expandable chat panel and Focus mode of Diff Viewer.** Chat panel of Diff Viewer now could be collapsed and expanded. Additionally a new Focus mode button was added to the Diff Viewer toolbar. When you want to focus on reviewed code or document, just click Focus mode to hide both the main toolbar and the Chat section. When Chat is hidden and you click anywhere in the Diff Viewer content, the Chat pane automatically expands so that you can input your comment or see existing comment or defect. It also automatically expands when another participant has submitted new comment or defect. (COLLAB-7729, COLLAB-7986)

  [![Focus mode](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13400/13400-focus-mode-anim.gif "Focus mode")](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13400/13400-focus-mode-anim.gif)

  Click the image to enlarge it.
* **Restrict moving pushpins to creator only.** The [Allow users to move comments](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/general.html#allow-move-comments) option got another possible value which restricts moving coordinate comments to review creators only. (COLLAB-7879)
* **Support for TLS 1.3.** Collaborator now supports the TLS 1.3 protocol for HTTPS connections. If your Collaborator server uses HTTPS, the TLS 1.3 protocol will become enabled during server upgrade. To use the TLS1.3 protocol your Collaborator server should be running on OpenJDK 11 or higher, since support for this protocol was [added in OpenJDK 11](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/332). (COLLAB-7841)
* **User list improvements.** Now the *Show active users* filter displays all users that consume licenses. (COLLAB-7962)
* The "Fix only" value was added to the [Can change other users' defects](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/review-templates/roles.html#can-change-other-users-defects) role setting. (COLLAB-7703)
* The [`admin user edit`](/collaborator/docs/reference/command-line/ccollab-admin-user-edit.html) command got new options to modify the users first and last name. (COLLAB-7662)

### 13.3.13301 - November 20, 2020

* fixed - Pushpin comments were cloned across all document reviews. (COLLAB-7979)
### 13.3.13300 - November 10, 2020

###### New Features

* **Assign multiple participants.** It became possible to assign multiple participants of the same role at once. So that you won't need to repeat this operation for each participant.

  ![](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13300/13300-participants-drop-down.png)

  To select multiple users, just click each desired user in the Participants drop-down list. To select a range of users, click on the first user, hold down the `Shift` key and then click the last user. To select all users (respecting current type-in filter, if any), click Select All button. To clear previous selection, click Clear All button. (COLLAB-6911)
* **Seamless scrolling for documents.** We have add a caching mechanism to pre-load a few pages before and after the currently displayed page, so that users don't have to wait on pages to load as they scroll. (COLLAB-7740)
* **Prevent comments/defects during rework phase or after the deadline.** Two new [review template options](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/review-templates/index.html#enable-comments-defects-during-rework-phase) were added. One specifies whether participants could create comments and defects during rework phase, and another specifies whether participants could create comments and defects after the deadline. If disabled, only review creators, authors or admins could create comments and defects. (COLLAB-1124, COLLAB-4815)
* **Regular users could configure remote hosting integrations.** Now administrators can enable the global [Allow users to configure remote systems](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/remote-systems.html#allow-users-to-configure-remote-systems) option and grant selected users with the [Can configure remote systems](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/users.html#special-user-permissions) permission so these users could configure remote system integrations in the same way, as administrators. (COLLAB-7710)

###### More improvements:

* **Retain accepted conversation status for code and text.** If some changes in source code and text files were accepted earlier and have not changed in newly uploaded revision, the respective line comments will keep their [accepted status](/collaborator/docs/working-with/concepts/chats.html#accept-button). (COLLAB-4829)
* **Display name improvements.** Now the [Display name](/collaborator/docs/web-client/manage-acc/user-prefs.html#account-information) user setting can be up to 128 characters long. Besides, in Collaborator 13.3 we have added an option to restrict editing by end-users, so that only administrators [could modify all user display names](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/general.html#allow-to-edit-users-display-names). (COLLAB-7730)
* Azure DevOps integration, now can automatically assign Collaborator reviewers when some specific users were added as pull request reviewers on the Azure DevOps side and integration can match those Azure DevOps users with Collaborator users. (COLLAB-7720)
* Verified support for Rational Team Concert version 7.0.1. (COLLAB-7676)

###### Discontinued Support:

* Bitbucket Server 7.0 and later no longer support the [upstream changes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/bitbucket-server-7-0-release-notes-990546638.html#BitbucketServer7.0releasenotes-Amodifiedbehaviorfordiffs) functionality. Collaborator's integration with Bitbucket Server will not support it either.
* Single sign-on integration using Java servlet for Tomcat is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. Please consider implementing single sign-on using [SAML](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/single-sign-on/saml.html) or [Atlassian Crowd OpenID](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/single-sign-on/crowd.html) instead.

* fixed - The value of Wrap option did not change when selecting "Remember my decision" in "Navigate to next location" dialog. (COLLAB-2231)
### 13.2.13201 - November 27, 2020

* fixed - Collaborator calculates file metrics for non-modified files controlled by TFS. (COLLAB-7825)
* fixed - Review cannot be created or updated if pull request contains submodule commit. (COLLAB-7844)
* fixed - The column with the row numbers could become hidden during the horizontal scrolling. (COLLAB-7884)
* fixed - MySQL: Problem with importing dumps with string records larger than 65535 characters. (COLLAB-7896)
* fixed - Defects were not highlighted with red frame when reviewing .xls/.xlsx files. (COLLAB-7901)
* fixed - Unable to upload .docx, . doc, or .pdf file for a second time if a review with this file was been deleted previously. (COLLAB-7963)
### 13.2.13200 - September 30, 2020

###### New Features

* **Customizable dashboards for the Home page.** Now it become possible to customize review grid on the Web Client's Home page. You can add or hide standard review fields as well as custom review fields. To do this, hover the ![Gear](/collaborator/docs/_images/controls/icon-gear.png) button and select the desired review fields in the drop-down list. (COLLAB-3829)

  ![](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13200/13200-customizable-home-page.png)
* **Easier way to work with defects.** We have improved UI to perform most frequent actions over defects (Mark fixed, Edit, Reopen, Delete) in a fewer number of clicks. (COLLAB-5172)

  ![](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13200/13200-defect-toolbar.png)
* **Plug-in for Excel.** We have added [Collaborator plug-in for Microsoft Excel](/collaborator/docs/desktop-clients/office-plugins/overview.html) and revamped plug-ins for Word and PowerPoint. These plug-ins allow uploading documents directly from Microsoft Word, PowerPoint or Excel. (COLLAB-6314)

###### More improvements:

* **Caching of most frequently used API calls to remote repositories.** In order to decrease number of calls to repository hosting servers, Collaborator caches some of the most often retrieved entities from APIs (commits, pull request diffs, commit diffs). By default cache contains up to 20000 entities for each active remote system integration. To change the default cache size or disable caching, use the server's `-Dcom.smartbear.collab.datamodel.remotesystem.cache.size`[Java VM Options](/collaborator/docs/reference/java-vm-options.html#java-server-properties). (COLLAB-5913, COLLAB-6373, COLLAB-7436, COLLAB-7437, COLLAB-7438)
* **Re-connecting when remote repository server is temporary unavailable.** If the remote repository server is not available, Collaborator will wait for some time and will make several more attempts to reach the server. Wait time is increased with each attempt: wait\_time\*1, wait\_time\*2, wait\_time\*3 and so on. Default wait time is 1 second and Collaborator will perform 3 retries. Wait time and maximal number of attempts could be configured via [Java VM Options](/collaborator/docs/reference/java-vm-options.html#com.smartbear.collab.datamodel.remotesystem.api.client.retry.seconds). If the server did not respond after all attempts, Collaborator will mark the respective webhook as inactive and put an exception to the [remoteSystem.log](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/logging.html). This behaviour currently applies to GitHub, Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server, and Azure DevOps integrations. (COLLAB-6450)
* Added a progress indicator on Review screen during upload of pull request files. (COLLAB-6449)
* Built-in syntax highlighting schemes were added for Swift, Kotlin and Typescript programming languages. (COLLAB-7616, COLLAB-7617, COLLAB-7618)

###### Bug Fixes:

* fixed - There could be significant differences between license usage values: *NumUsersCurrentlyLoggedIn* and *LicenseSeatsInUse*. (COLLAB-7725)
* fixed - Collaborator was unable to load a review (the review screen hung) if that review was based on a template that had no Moderator role specified. (COLLAB-7723)
* fixed - There were too many unexpected "Metrics are missing ..." messages in the log file. (COLLAB-7705)
* fixed - Too many errors with "com.google.common.cache.LocalCache" in the log made the log hardly readable. (COLAB-7702)
* fixed - Sometimes, the pins' coordinates got broken after you uploaded a newer version of the file being reviewed. (COLLAB-7677)
* fixed - Collaborator SAML metadata file contained a wrong certificate, which caused errors when attempting single logout. (COLLAB-7639)
* fixed - A review created from a pull request did not contain the review materials if the PR included file permission changes for files larger than 1 MB. (COLLAB-7628)
* fixed - The Defect Log did not display the defect text if it was long and contained HTML tags. (COLLAB-7559)
* fixed - The "Show conversation with open defects" filter does not work when there are unread comments. (COLLAB-6949)
* fixed - The Diff Viewer did not show some defects and comments until a user started scrolling the list. (COLLAB-6901)
### 13.1.13100 - August 18, 2020

###### New Features

* **Ability to edit/delete comments.** In previous versions it was not possible to modify or permanently delete a comment. That was done to keep all comments intact for auditing purposes. Yet sometimes that limitation was too strict. Now this ability could be controlled via the new [Allow to edit/delete comments](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/general.html#allow-to-edit-delete-comments) option. Once enabled, review participants could modify or delete their own comments, unless they are followed by another participant's comment. (COLLAB-4711)

  ![](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13100/13100-edit-comment.png)
* **Move coordinate comments via drag-and-drop.** Now you can re-position coordinate comments by dragging its pushpin to a new location. (COLLAB-3060)

  ![](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13100/13100-moving-pushpins-drag.gif)
* **Tabbed pages in Review Chat.** Sometimes it was difficult to locate messages from other participants among system-generated messages in Review Chat.

  ![](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13100/13100-tabs-in-review-chat.png)

  Now there Chat section in Web UI contains three tabs: User messages tab displays comments and acceptance marks of other participants, including user comments from remote repositories, while System messages tab displays system information related to current review: defects, file uploads, marking checklist items and so forth, and All messages tab displays participant and system messages altogether. (COLLAB-7246)
* **Table borders in Spreadsheets.** Diff Viewer now displays table borders when [reviewing spreadsheets](/collaborator/docs/working-with/materials/spreadsheets.html). Yet, some borders, for example “dot-dash” borders, or too thin borders could not be displayed properly because of html-rendering limitations. (COLLAB-5550)
* JSON API methods to list group membership. (COLLAB-7471)

###### More improvements:

* When [deleting a review](/collaborator/docs/reference/ui/review-screen/header-toolbar.html#delete-review-btn), Collaborator deletes files that were uploaded for this review from the [content storage](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/content-storage.html) as well (unless they are used in some other reviews). (COLLAB-5300)
* New option to enable or disable [user role syncing](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/single-sign-on/saml.html#User-Role-sync) between SAML and Collaborator servers, when [syncing user membership with SAML SSO server](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/single-sign-on/saml.html#SAML-group-synch). (COLLAB-7440)
* New option to specify [type of SAML SLO signature](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/single-sign-on/saml.html#Signature-type). It allows selecting whether to use embedded attribute signature (HTTP-POST binding), or send signature as url parameter (HTTP-Redirect binding). (COLLAB-7430)
* The password of built-in administrator could be changed via [command-line](/collaborator/docs/reference/command-line/ccollab-admin-user-edit.html), just like any other user's password. (COLLAB-7275)
* Improved logic for uploading files and changelists to the review. (COLLAB-5561, COLLAB-4680)
* The [Report Error feature](/collaborator/docs/web-client/troubleshooting.html) of Web Client now uses SmartBear Support Portal to report issues. (COLLAB-7328)
* Messages about new version uploads are now displayed only in the Review Chat and in file's Overall comment section. (COLLAB-7345)
* Improved the performance of the "List Complete" notifications on huge databases. (COLLAB-7429)
* Calculate time tracking activity on active tab only; make tracking mechanism more accurate. (COLLAB-6140)
* The review timeline now logs who and when has changed review template, added or removed participants, changed participant roles, added or removed checklists.(COLLAB-5942)

###### Bug Fixes:

* fixed - Integration with Azure DevOps was not creating reviews if the Collaborator server was using SAML single sign-on. (COLLAB-7610)
* fixed - If the session of a user who started uploading files was terminated, Collaborator removes the changelist and file versions records from database. (COLLAB-7592)
* fixed - The Review Materials section doesn't load all the files if null pointer exception occurs within the fileModifications object. (COLLAB-7577)
* fixed - Electronic signature didn't work if the Collaborator server was configured with single sign-on. (COLLAB-7565)
* fixed - The "Confirm the Review Sign-Off" form doesn't show the "Cannot authenticate" exception when a wrong or empty password is provided. (COLLAB-7564)
* fixed - GitLab integration: auto merge, pull request comment promotion and pipeline status did not work on review phase change. (COLLAB-7518)
* fixed - Decrease amount of queries while opening review summary. (COLLAB-7490)
* fixed - Collaborator was sending the "Start inspection" notification for reviews that were reopened, while it should send the "Resume inspection" notification instead. (COLLAB-7441)
* fixed - After calling `version.getContentStream()` input stream was not closed which could lead to significant number of opened streams. (COLLAB-7484)
* fixed - In certain cases Diff Viewer did not show navigation panel when opening spreadsheet file. (COLLAB-7434)
* fixed - A username was exposed in the Set-Cookie header. (COLLAB-7407)
* fixed - Database upgrade failure when multiple themes are present but dark theme is missing. (COLLAB-7379)
* fixed - Electronic signatures should use the same case-sensitivity as authentication method. (COLLAB-7361)

### 13.0.13002 - July 22, 2020

###### Improvements

* New option to enable or disable [user role syncing](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/single-sign-on/saml.html#User-Role-sync) between SAML and Collaborator servers, when [syncing user membership with SAML SSO server](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/single-sign-on/saml.html#SAML-group-synch). (COLLAB-7440)
* New option to specify [type of SAML SLO signature](/collaborator/docs/server/admin-tasks/single-sign-on/saml.html#Signature-type). It allows selecting whether to use embedded attribute signature (HTTP-POST binding), or send signature as url parameter (HTTP-Redirect binding). (COLLAB-7430)
* The password of built-in administrator could be changed via [command-line](/collaborator/docs/reference/command-line/ccollab-admin-user-edit.html), just like any other user's password. (COLLAB-7275)
* Improved logic for uploading files and changelists to the review. (COLLAB-5561, COLLAB-4680)

* fixed - Failed to generate review detailed report if there are any defects in overall review chat. (COLLAB-7283)
### 13.0.13001 - June 29, 2020

* fixed - On SQL Server databases with indexes enabled, for example on Azure SQL database with automatic tuning mode, upgrading Collaborator may fail with the "The index 'NNN' is dependent on column 'MMM'." exception. (COLLAB-6267, COLLAB-7473)
### 13.0.13000 - June 22, 2020

###### New Features

* **Multiple checklists per review.** Starting from version 13.0 it will become possible to have several [checklists](/collaborator/docs/reference/ui/review-screen/checklist.html) in a template. When creating review author could select which of the checklists to use. (COLLAB-3695, COLLAB-2005)

  ![Appending checklists](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13000/checklist-append.png)
  Appending checklists

  Checklist for active review can be changed by participants, which have an [access to review](/collaborator/docs/server/settings/general.html#restrict-review-content). In this case, previous checklist will be cleared and a notice would be appended to review chat. (COLLAB-6671)
* **Select All Items for checklists.** It became possible to check or un-check all items in a checklist at once. To do this, click the check mark in the Status column header (not available in edit-mode). (COLLAB-6737)

  ![Check all items in a checklist at once](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13000/checklist-mark-all-items.png)
  Check all items in a checklist at once
* **New *Approved by workflow* state.** In previous versions, some of non-approving roles (in standard roles scheme they are Observer and Moderator) could remain in "*Active*" or "*Waiting*" state when the review was completed without their interaction. Now such participants would get the "*Approved by workflow*" state. (COLLAB-7257)

###### Improvements in converting and comparing materials

* **Parallel conversion of files** - Previously all uploaded materials were converted in one chunk, so you had to wait until all uploaded materials are converted. Now each document is uploaded and converted separately, so that if there is a delay or conversion issue with one of the files, it would not lock all review materials and you can work with other files.

  When the respective document is being converted, its progress is displayed in the Location column of the Review Materials section. (COLLAB-6865)

  [![Document conversion progress](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13000/document-conversion-progress.png "Document conversion progress")](/collaborator/docs/_images/general-info/version-history/13000/document-conversion-progress.png)

  Click the image to enlarge it.
* **Asynchronous conversion upon initial upload** - When a document is uploaded for the first time, it is now converted in asynchronous threads and could be displayed in Diff Viewer as soon as its top pages are ready. (COLLAB-6777)
* **Conversion on demand** - When user navigates to a specific page that is not yet converted, that page is converted primarily. (COLLAB-6783)
* **Performance speedup** - We have optimized some of conversion and comparison routines to improve their performance. (COLLAB-7427)
* Clarified and improved text of error messages that may occur during document conversion. (COLLAB-6155)

###### More improvements:

* **Retain document zoom when changing pages.** Diff Viewer now keeps document zoom value in browser cache (per each document). Initial zoom value is specified by the [Default Scale for Documents in Diff Viewer](/collaborator/docs/web-client/manage-acc/user-prefs.html#Default-Scale-for-Documents) setting. When you change scale of current document in the Diff Viewer it will be cached so that all further pages of that document would be displayed in the same scale. (COLLAB-6906, COLLAB-6133, COLLAB-5854)
* Information about pull request branches is now displayed in the Chat section of the Review Summary screen. (COLLAB-4138)
* Now you can remove files with a warning about missing fonts unless they have comments from other participants. (COLLAB-6792)
* All Web Client theme-related setting are now cached to decrease amount of queries to database. (COLLAB-7244)

###### Bug Fixes:

* fixed - Remove redundant calls to database while getting user unread comments and info about remote system relations. (COLLAB-7412)
* fixed - Improve "unread conversations" SQL query that caused performance degradation. (COLLAB-7410, COLLAB-7279)
* fixed - Same user or group was added multiple times when the subscription triggers more than once in a review. (COLLAB-7408, COLLAB-7148)
* fixed - Collaborator server could not start after upgrade if single sign on was enabled before the upgrade. (COLLAB-7393)
* fixed - An error when exporting the Review Detail Report to PDF if the Overall chat contained any defects. (COLLAB-7283)
* fixed - The command-line client could not automatically detect Perforce configuration. (COLLAB-7205)
* fixed - In certain cases a review could not be sent to rework, it showed a warning about unread comments, but there were actually no unread comments. (COLLAB-7201)
* fixed - Encrypt and secure admin contact information when sending it to SmartBear licensing server. (COLLAB-7191)
* fixed - The "Couldn't find convo that contained comment" error in the log. (COLLAB-6802)
* fixed - The "Multiple conversations include comment" exception in logs. (COLLAB-6766)
* fixed - An error when generating the User Detail Report on Oracle database. (COLLAB-6649)
* fixed - The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when converting DOCX document. (COLLAB-6548)
* fixed - Oracle TO\_CHAR() was used in search with non-Oracle databases. (COLLAB-5883)
* fixed - No busy indicator in Internet Explorer during document conversion. (COLLAB-4895)
* fixed - Could not generate the Recently Completed Reviews report that included any LOC metrics. (COLLAB-2977)
