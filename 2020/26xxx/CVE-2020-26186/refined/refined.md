- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Dell Inspiron 5675 BIOS versions prior to 1.4.1 contain a vulnerability that allows overwriting the UEFI BIOS RuntimeServices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A UEFI BIOS RuntimeServices overwrite vulnerability exists.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker with access to system memory may exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode (SMM), leading to potential compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker with access to system memory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system's memory. They do not need any special privileges, and no user interaction is required for exploitation.
