  "CVE-2020-26230": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability enables the identification and de-anonymization of COVID-19 positive users when using Radar COVID. The vulnerability is caused by the fact that Radar COVID connections to the server (uploading of TEKs to the backend) are only made by COVID-19 positives. Therefore, any on-path observer with the ability to monitor traffic between the app and the server can identify which users had a positive test.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the fact that Radar COVID connections to the server (uploading of TEKs to the backend) are only made by COVID-19 positives.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of dummy traffic to mask real uploads from positive cases"
    ],
    "Impact": "Identification and de-anonymization of COVID-19 positive users that upload Radar COVID TEKs to the Radar COVID server.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Mobile network operator (MNO)",
      "Internet Service Provider (ISP)",
      "VPN provider",
      "Local network operator",
       "Eavesdropper with access to the same network (WiFi or Ethernet)"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to monitor traffic between the app and the server.",
    "Additional details": "The attacker may also de-anonymize the user. For this additional stage to succeed, the adversary needs to correlate Radar COVID traffic to other identifiable information from the victim. This could be achieved by associating the connection to a contract with the name of the victim or by associating Radar COVID traffic to other user-generated flows containing identifiers in the clear (e.g., HTTP cookies or other mobile flows sending unique identifiers like the IMEI or the AAID without encryption)."
