Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26963:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions "CVE-2020-26963" and links it to Bugzilla bug 1314912, which is described as "history.pushState - Firefox Hangs and then iterating script error". The advisory also confirms this vulnerability. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of rate limiting in the `history.pushState`, `history.replaceState` and `location.hash` interfaces.  Repeated calls to these interfaces by a website's JavaScript could cause the browser to hang or become unresponsive, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This is due to the excessive amount of location change events that are triggered and processed, overloading the parent process.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:** The primary weakness is the absence of a mechanism to limit the number of calls to history manipulation functions within a given time frame. This allows malicious or poorly designed websites to abuse these functionalities.
*   **Parent Process Overload:** The excessive location change events can overwhelm the browser's parent process, causing it to become unresponsive. This affects the entire browser UI.
*   **Memory Growth:** The continuous generation of URIs in the RemoteWebNavigation module during excessive location changes can lead to uncontrolled memory growth, further exacerbating the issue.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a denial-of-service condition. The browser becomes unresponsive, hangs, and the user may need to force-quit the application. In some extreme cases, it may cause the whole system to become unresponsive.
*   **User Frustration:** Users will experience significant frustration due to the browser being unusable.
*   **Potential for Malicious Use:** This vulnerability can be used by attackers to make a browser unusable. It was noted that some tech support scam websites were abusing this technique.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** Attackers can craft malicious web pages with JavaScript code that repeatedly calls `history.pushState`, `history.replaceState` or modifies the `location.hash`, triggering the vulnerability.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Legitimate websites can be compromised and injected with this malicious code.
*   **Content Scripts:** Malicious browser extensions (content scripts) could also exploit this vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve Web Content:** The attacker needs to be able to serve HTML/JavaScript content to the target user. This can be achieved by hosting a malicious website, compromising an existing one, or crafting a malicious ad.
*   **No Privilege Escalation Required:** The attacker does not need elevated privileges to trigger the vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered within the context of the browser itself.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable interfaces and how to exploit them.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability was initially reported to affect Firefox 49 and later.
*   The fix involves rate-limiting the calls to `history.pushState`, `history.replaceState` and `location.hash` interfaces. The rate limit is counted per BrowsingContextGroup, per process.
*   The initial patch implemented a throttling mechanism for same-document navigations caused by content scripts by limiting the number of successive `LOCATION_CHANGE_SAME_DOCUMENT` events.
*   Further work was done to rate limit all methods of the History interface and the location.hash setter for non-system callers.
*   The fix was included in Firefox 83.
*   The bug report references similar vulnerabilities in Chromium.

**Additional Information:**

*   The bug report includes test cases that demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   The fix includes tests to verify that the rate-limiting mechanism works as expected.
*   Several duplicate bug reports highlight that various forms of excessive navigation changes have the same effect of causing a DoS to the browser's parent process.
*   The fix prevents excessive location changes caused by click events on anchors as well.
*   The bug is classified as a defect with a priority of P2.
