Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26205:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) issue present in the `machine_list` view of the SAL application. The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization/escaping of user-supplied input before rendering it in the HTML page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed by the victim's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- XSS Vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session when they are viewing the `machine_list` page. This could lead to:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Other malicious activity within the context of the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user input that is not properly sanitized. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a field that is displayed on the `machine_list` view.
- An attacker would need to somehow get the malicious payload into the application, such as through the machine naming/description or through any other user-controlled data field that ends up on the machine list page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious javascript into a field that will be displayed on the `machine_list` view. This could be done through any method that would allow user-supplied data to be saved to the application's database, then rendered on this page.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by `nahamsec`.
- The fix involves escaping user input to prevent XSS.
- The fix was implemented in commit `145bb72daf8460bdedbbc9fb708d346283e7a568`.
- The fix was included in the `4.1.7` release of the SAL application.
- GitHub's CNA team assigned CVE-2020-26205.
