{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The add and delete REST API endpoints for Tags and Links were requested via GET requests, which lack CSRF token checks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could add or delete Tags and Links from a user that the web application trusts.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could craft a malicious link or webpage that, when visited by a logged-in user, would send a GET request to the vulnerable API endpoint, causing unwanted tag/link changes on the victim's account.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious link or webpage. The attacker does not need direct access to the Zammad application, just a user's active session."
