The provided content is related to CVE-2020-26030.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an authentication bypass in the SSO endpoint of Zammad. The system incorrectly creates valid authenticated sessions when a special header is sent to the SSO endpoint, even if SSO is not configured.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of the `X-Forwarded-User` header in the SSO endpoint.
- Lack of proper validation for the presence of the header before creating a session
- Failure to verify if SSO is enabled for the instance

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can create authenticated sessions on behalf of arbitrary users.
- The attacker can then perform any actions within the Zammad system using these sessions, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, and other malicious activities.
- While the user will receive a "new device login" notification, this does not prevent the initial exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the SSO endpoint of the Zammad system.
- The attacker needs to send a specially crafted request with the `X-Forwarded-User` header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Zammad server.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication or knowledge of user credentials.
