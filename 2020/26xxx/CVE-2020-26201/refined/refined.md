Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-26201:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Askey AP5100W access point used weak, easily crackable passwords for its operating system (OS) users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Weak Passwords:** The default and potentially other passwords used for OS users on the device were 8 characters long with average complexity, making them vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
*   **Insecure Remote Access:**  Remote access protocols like SSH and Telnet were enabled on the device, providing an attack vector if passwords were compromised.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could crack the OS user passwords, gaining unauthorized root access to the device via SSH or Telnet.
*   **Malware Installation:** With root access, attackers could install malicious software on the access point.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers with root access could extract sensitive data from the device.
*   **Full System Control:** Gaining root access grants full control of the device's operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The initial access was gained by exploiting the WPS vulnerability, allowing the attacker to connect to the Wi-Fi network.
*   **Brute-Force Password Cracking:** Once connected, attackers used password cracking tools to compromise weak OS user passwords.
*   **Remote Access Protocols:** SSH and Telnet were used for remote access once the passwords were cracked.
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within a reasonable range (approximately 50m) of the vulnerable AP to exploit the WPS vulnerability.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs to have knowledge and tools for:
    *   Performing WPS attacks (e.g., `reaver` with `pixiedust`).
    *   Executing OS commands on a web interface (e.g., command injection).
    *   Password cracking.
    *   Using SSH/Telnet for remote access.
*   **Hardware:**
    *   A wireless card that supports monitor mode.
    *   A computer running a penetration testing OS (e.g. Kali Linux).

**Additional Notes:**
*   This CVE is related to a specific device, Askey AP5100W access point.
*   The article also covers CVE-2020-15023 (WPS Pin Code Cracking) and CVE-2020-15357 (Code Execution) vulnerabilities, which can be chained together to compromise the device, although these are separate vulnerabilities.
*   The author recommends disabling WPS, using strong passwords, and performing firmware updates as mitigation strategies.
