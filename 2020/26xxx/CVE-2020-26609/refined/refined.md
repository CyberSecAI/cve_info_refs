The provided content is related to CVE-2020-26609.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of comprehensive input filtering in the `application\admin\controller\Category.php` file within the Fastadmin framework.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the presence of a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application.

**Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can potentially obtain administrator credentials, allowing them to log in to the background administration panel. The attacker can then use the admin privileges to further compromise the application.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the "category management-edit-nickname" input field. By injecting malicious JavaScript code into this field and saving, the XSS vulnerability is triggered when the category is displayed/used.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel to edit the category information. The attacker needs to have at least some sort of user privileges to access and edit the category information.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable version is `V1.0.0.20200506_beta`.
- The provided payload is `"><img src=1 onerror=alert(document.cookie)>` which is a classic XSS payload to extract cookie information.
