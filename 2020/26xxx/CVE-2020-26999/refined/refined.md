Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-26999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR files within Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization. Specifically, the application fails to validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The inadequate validation leads to a memory access beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer during PAR file parsing. This is also described as a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leakage:** The out-of-bounds read vulnerability could allow an attacker to leak sensitive information from the system's memory.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This suggests the possibility of taking control of the affected system.
- **Application Crash:** Malformed PAR files can lead to application crashes due to the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted, malicious PAR file using the vulnerable application.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability, as the target must be tricked into opening the malicious file or visiting a malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PAR file to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious PAR file using the vulnerable JT2Go or Teamcenter Visualization application.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability is categorized as a heap-based buffer overflow in one advisory, indicating the memory corruption is occurring in the heap memory region.
-  The ZDI advisories note that the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Siemens assigned a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts.
- The vulnerability was reported to Siemens by the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) and rgod.
- The vulnerability is fixed in JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization version V13.1.0.2 or later.
