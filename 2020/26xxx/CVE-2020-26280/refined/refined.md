Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26280:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Insufficient user input validation and escaping in user-editable HTML fields. Specifically, the application failed to properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is persistent (stored) XSS. This means that the malicious script is stored within the application's database and executed whenever a user views the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of other users' sessions.
- **Data Manipulation:** Malicious code could be used to manipulate votes, potentially altering the outcome of polls or elections managed by OpenSlides.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially hijack the moderator's session, granting them elevated privileges and control over meetings.
- **Disruption:** Attackers could disrupt meetings by injecting code that modifies the user interface or displays unwanted content.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **User Input Fields:** Vulnerable user input fields include those allowing rich text, such as personal notes or motion text.
- **REST Web Service:** An attacker could use the REST API to submit malicious content, as demonstrated in the provided Proof of Concept (PoC).
- **Persistent nature:** The injected code is stored and executed whenever a user views the content, affecting all users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the OpenSlides application, with the ability to create or edit content in vulnerable fields.
- **Access to REST API (Optional):** While not strictly necessary, access to the REST API can be used as an attack vector, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code via API requests.
