Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26124:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an "Authenticated PHP Code Injection" flaw in OpenMediaVault. This suggests that an attacker, after authenticating, can inject malicious PHP code, which would then be executed by the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- PHP Code Injection: The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code. This indicates a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input within PHP scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full System Compromise: Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the OpenMediaVault system. This includes the ability to read/write files, execute system commands, and potentially take full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Authenticated Access: The attacker needs to have valid authentication credentials to exploit this vulnerability. This suggests the vulnerability is triggered by actions or data that authenticated users can control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Valid Credentials: An attacker needs to be a valid user of the OpenMediaVault instance to exploit the vulnerability.
- Knowledge of Vulnerable Input: The attacker must be aware of how to inject malicious PHP code into input fields or parameters that are processed by the server.
