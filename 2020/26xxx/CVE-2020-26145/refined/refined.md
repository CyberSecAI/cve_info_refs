Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-26145:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how some Wi-Fi implementations handle broadcast fragments. Specifically, they accept second (or subsequent) broadcast fragments even when sent in plaintext within an encrypted network and process them as if they were complete, unfragmented frames.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The Wi-Fi implementations fail to validate if broadcast fragments in an encrypted network are encrypted before processing them, treating plaintext fragments as valid data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary network packet injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary network packets by crafting a plaintext broadcast fragment, which the vulnerable device will then process as a complete frame, effectively bypassing encryption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Wireless communication:** The attacker needs to be within the range of the vulnerable Wi-Fi network.
*   **Plaintext Broadcast Fragment Injection:** The attack vector is the injection of a plaintext broadcast fragment into the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the vulnerable Wi-Fi network.
*   **Packet crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to craft Wi-Fi packets, specifically broadcast fragments, with arbitrary content.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited regardless of the network's configuration.
*   The vulnerability is classified as an implementation flaw, arising from incorrect handling of broadcast fragments in the receiving logic.
*   The attacker exploits the fact that devices process the second or subsequent fragments of a broadcast message even when they are sent in plaintext.
