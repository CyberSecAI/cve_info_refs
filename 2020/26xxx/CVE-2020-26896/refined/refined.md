Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-26896:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from LND (Lightning Network Daemon) incorrectly using its invoice database when resolving incoming HTLCs (Hashed TimeLock Contracts) on-chain.
- When claiming an on-chain HTLC, LND would fall back to the invoice database to retrieve the preimage if it wasn't found in the preimage database. This happened even when the node was not the final recipient of the payment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Preimage Retrieval:** LND failed to properly distinguish between HTLCs meant for forwarding and those intended as final payments. Instead of using the preimage database for forwarded HTLCs, it could incorrectly retrieve the preimage from the invoice database if a hash collision occurred.
- **HTLC Hash Collision:** An attacker could craft a malicious HTLC with the same hash and amount as an expected payment HTLC.
- **Missing Off-Chain Settlement Verification:** LND didn't verify that an outgoing off-chain HTLC was settled before releasing a preimage for an incoming HTLC with the same hash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Fund Loss (Indirect):** The victim node releases the preimage for a payment, believing it has been paid. A malicious peer can then claim the original payment intended for the victim. The victim only receives routing fees.
- **Privacy Leak:** The vulnerability revealed the invoice preimage, which could be used to identify the final recipient of a payment.
- **Incorrect Invoice Status:** The invoice status would be marked as settled, even though the actual payment was not received. This can lead to issues with inventory management or service delivery.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Peer Interception:** A malicious peer intercepts a legitimate HTLC intended for the victim.
- **Malicious HTLC Creation:** The attacker creates a new malicious HTLC with a colliding hash and amount, which is then routed through the victim to trigger on-chain claiming.
- **Channel Force Close:** The attacker forces a channel closure to trigger the victim to claim their HTLC onchain, revealing the preimage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Routing Node:** The attacker must be a routing node on the Lightning Network and have a channel with sufficient outgoing bandwidth.
- **Knowledge of Victim's Node Pubkey:** The attacker needs to know the victim's node pubkey.
- **Ability to Intercept and Delay HTLCs:** The attacker must be able to intercept and hold an HTLC.
- **Ability to create and manipulate routing paths:** The attacker needs to be able to create specific payment paths to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Identify target victim:** The attacker has to have some knowledge of what the intended victim is selling in order to craft a colliding HTLC.
- **Colluding Node (Optional):** The attacker may need a colluding node to complete the attack, but this is not strictly necessary.
- **Timing is key**: The attacker must time the channel closure to occur before the malicious HTLC's CLTV (CheckLockTimeVerify) expires.
- **No MPP Payment Secret:** This attack is ineffective against multi-path payments with payment secrets.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects routing nodes that also receive payments (e.g., merchant nodes).
- Non-routing nodes are not affected.
- The attack is more difficult to execute if MPP is properly deployed and with mandatory payment secrets.
- The attack could be stealthy as the victim might not immediately notice the loss.
- The vulnerability was fixed in LND v0.11.0-beta by isolating the preimage and invoice databases.
