### @zsfelfoldi **[zsfelfoldi](/zsfelfoldi)** commented [Nov 24, 2020](#issue-749260834)

* metrics: zero temp variable in  updateMeter (#21470)

* metrics: zero temp variable in  updateMeter

Previously the temp variable was not updated properly after summing it to count.
This meant we had astronomically high metrics, now we zero out the temp whenever we
sum it onto the snapshot count

* metrics: move temp variable to be aligned, unit tests

Moves the temp variable in MeterSnapshot to be 64-bit aligned because of the atomic bug.
Adds a unit test, that catches the previous bug.

* trie, downloader: check bloom nilness externally

* core/state/snapshot: reduce disk layer depth during generation

* p2p/discover: avoid dropping unverified nodes when table is almost empty (#21396)

This change improves discovery behavior in small networks. Very small
networks would often fail to bootstrap because all member nodes were
dropping table content due to findnode failure. The check is now changed
to avoid dropping nodes on findnode failure when their bucket is almost
empty. It also relaxes the liveness check requirement for FINDNODE/v4
response nodes, returning unverified nodes as results when there aren't
any verified nodes yet.

The \"findnode failed\" log now reports whether the node was dropped
instead of the number of results. The value of the \"results\" was
always zero by definition.

I think this info is more a DEBUG related information then an INFO. If it must remains an INFO, maybe it can be slow down to one time every 5 minutes or so.

* Update queue.go

\"Downloader queue stats\" information is now provided once every minute instead of once every 10 seconds.

* go.mod : update goja dependency (#21432)

* eth/downloader: change intial download size (#21366)

This changes how the downloader works, a little bit. Previously, when block sync started,
we immediately started filling up to 8192 blocks. Usually this is fine, blocks are small
in the early numbers. The threshold then is lowered as we measure the size of the blocks
that are filled.

However, if the node is shut down and restarts syncing while we're in a heavy segment,
that might be bad. This PR introduces a more conservative initial threshold of 2K blocks
instead.

* miner: use channels instead of atomics in update loop (#21536)

This PR changes several different things:

- Adds test cases for the miner loop
- Stops the worker if it wasn't already stopped in worker.Close()
- Uses channels instead of atomics in the miner.update() loop

Co-authored-by: Felix Lange <fjl@twurst.com>

* miner: fix regression, add test for starting while download (#21547)

Fixes a regression introduced in #21536

* p2p/discover: fix typo in comments (#21554)

* Dockerfile: unexpose port 8547 as GraphQL was merged into HTTP endpoint (#21556)

* p2p/nodestate: ensure correct callback order (#21436)

This PR adds an extra guarantee to NodeStateMachine: it ensures that all
immediate effects of a certain change are processed before any subsequent
effects of any of the immediate effects on the same node. In the original
version, if a cascaded change caused a subscription callback to be called
multiple times for the same node then these calls might have happened in a
wrong chronological order.

For example:

- a subscription to flag0 changes flag1 and flag2
- a subscription to flag1 changes flag3
- a subscription to flag1, flag2 and flag3 was called in the following order:

   [flag1] -> [flag1, flag3]
   [] -> [flag1]
   [flag1, flag3] -> [flag1, flag2, flag3]

This happened because the tree of changes was traversed in a \"depth-first
order\". Now it is traversed in a \"breadth-first order\"; each node has a
FIFO queue for pending callbacks and each triggered subscription callback
is added to the end of the list. The already existing guarantees are
retained; no SetState or SetField returns until the callback queue of the
node is empty again. Just like before, it is the responsibility of the
state machine design to ensure that infinite state loops are not possible.
Multiple changes affecting the same node can still happen simultaneously;
in this case the changes can be interleaved in the FIFO of the node but the
correct order is still guaranteed.

A new unit test is also added to verify callback order in the above scenario.

* eth/tracers: regenerate assets from #21549 (#21564)

* COYPING: restore the full text text of GPL (#21568)

When the license was added to the repository, its text was changed (some

tried to claim copyright on the license text.

The correct way to apply GPL to a project is to copy it verbatim.
This change reverts the text of the GPL to the original.

According to the benchmarks, type assertion between the pointer and
interface is extremely fast.

BenchmarkIntmethod-12           1000000000               1.91 ns/op
BenchmarkInterface-12           1000000000               2.13 ns/op
BenchmarkTypeSwitch-12          1000000000               1.81 ns/op
BenchmarkTypeAssertion-12       2000000000               1.78 ns/op

So the overhead for asserting whether the shortnode has \"valuenode\"
child is super tiny. No necessary to have another field.

* cmd/geth, cmd/utils: fixed flags name (#21700)

* miner: don't interrupt mining after successful sync (#21701)

* miner: exit loop when downloader Done or Failed

Following the logic of the comment at the method,
this fixes a regression introduced at 7cf56d6f064869cb62b1673f9ee437020c595391
, which would allow external parties to DoS with
blocks, preventing mining progress.

* miner: fix waitForMiningState precision

This helper function would return an affirmation
on the first positive match on a desired bool.

This was imprecise; it return false positives
by not waiting initially for an 'updated' value.

This fix causes TestMiner_2 to fail, which is
expected.

* miner: fix test regarding downloader event/mining expectations

See comment for logic.

Signed-off-by: meows <b5c6@protonmail.com>

* miner: add test describing expectations for downloader/mining events

We expect that once the downloader emits a DoneEvent,
signaling a successful sync, that subsequent StartEvents
are not longer permitted to stop the miner.

This prevents a security vulnerability where forced syncs via
fake high blocks would stall mining operation.

* miner: use 'canStop' state to fix downloader event handling

- Break downloader event handling into event
separating Done and Failed events. We need to
treat these cases differently since a DoneEvent
should prevent the miner from being stopped on
subsequent downloader Start events.

- Use canStop state to handle the one-off
case when a downloader first succeeds.

This makes mining pause/start logic regarding downloader

* miner: refactor update loop to remove race condition

The go routine handling the downloader events handling

This change, though ugly, remove the condition while

The TestWalletNotifications test sporadically fails on travis.
This is because we shutdown the event collection before all events are received.

* les, p2p/simulations/adapters: fix issues found while simulating les  (#21761)

This adds a few tiny fixes for les and the p2p simulation framework:

LES Parts

- Keep the LES-SERVER connection even it's non-synced

  We had this idea to reject the connections in LES protocol if the les-server itself is
  not synced. However, in LES protocol we will also receive the connection from another
  les-server. In this case even the local node is not synced yet, we should keep the tcp
  connection for other protocols(e.g. eth protocol).

- Don't count \"invalid message\" for non-existing GetBlockHeadersMsg request

  In the eth syncing mechanism (full sync, fast sync, light sync), it will try to fetch
  some non-existent blocks or headers(to ensure we indeed download all the missing chain).
  In this case, it's possible that the les-server will receive the request for
  non-existent headers. So don't count it as the \"invalid message\" for scheduling
  dropping.

- Copy the announce object in the closure

  Before the les-server pushes the latest headers to all connected clients, it will create
  a closure and queue it in the underlying request scheduler. In some scenarios it's
  problematic. E.g, in private networks, the block can be mined very fast. So before the
  first closure is executed, we may already update the latest_announce object. So actually
  the \"announce\" object we want to send is replaced.

  The downsize is the client will receive two announces with the same td and then drop the
  server.

P2P Simulation Framework

- Don't double register the protocol services in p2p-simulation \"Start\".

  The protocols upon the devp2p are registered in the \"New node stage\". So don't reigster
  them again when starting a node in the p2p simulation framework

- Add one more new config field \"ExternalSigner\", in order to use clef service in the
  framework.

* common: remove ToHex and ToHexArray (#21610)

ToHex was deprecated a couple years ago. The last remaining use
was in ToHexArray, which itself only had a single call site.

This just moves ToHexArray near its only remaining call site and
implements it using hexutil.Encode. This changes the default behaviour
of ToHexArray and with it the behaviour of eth_getProof. Previously we
encoded an empty slice as 0, now the empty slice is encoded as 0x.

* core/state/snapshot: fix journal recovery from generating old journal (#21775)

* core/state/snapshot: print warning if failed to resolve journal

* core/state/snapshot: fix snapshot recovery

When we meet the snapshot journal consisted with:
- disk layer generator with new-format
- diff layer journal with old-format

The base layer should be returned without error.
The broken diff layer can be reconstructed later
but we definitely don't want to reconstruct the
huge diff layer.

* core: add tests

* cmd/devp2p, internal/utesting: implement TAP output (#21760)

TAP is a text format for test results. Parsers for it are available in many languages,
making it easy to consume. I want TAP output from our protocol tests because the
Hive wrapper around them needs to know about the test names and their individual
results and logs. It would also be possible to just write this info as JSON, but I don't
want to invent a new format.

This also improves the normal console output for tests (when running without --tap).
It now prints -- RUN lines before any output from the test, and indents the log output
by one space.

* cmd/devp2p/internal/ethtest: add correct chain files and improve test output (#21782)

This PR replaces the old test genesis.json and chain.rlp files in the testdata
directory for the eth protocol test suite, and also adds documentation for
running the eth test suite locally.

It also improves the test output text and adds more timeouts.

* core/types, rlp: optimize derivesha (#21728)

This PR contains a minor optimization in derivesha, by exposing the RLP
int-encoding and making use of it to write integers directly to a
buffer (an RLP integer is known to never require more than 9 bytes
total). rlp.AppendUint64 might be useful in other places too.

The code assumes, just as before, that the hasher (a trie) will copy the
key internally, which it does when doing keybytesToHex(key).

- Remove the ws:// prefix from the status endpoint since
  the ws:// is already included in the stack.WSEndpoint().
- Don't register the services again in the node start.
  Registration is already done in the initialization stage.
- Expose admin namespace via websocket.
  This namespace is necessary for connecting the peers via websocket.
- Offer logging relevant options for exec adapter.
  It's really painful to mix all log output in the single console. So
  this PR offers two additional options for exec adapter in this case
  testers can config the log output(e.g. file output) and log level
  for each p2p node.

This PR fixes a deadlock reported here: #21925

The cause is that many operations may be pending, but if the close happens, only one of them gets awoken and exits, the others remain waiting for a signal that never comes.

* cmd/devp2p: add node filter for snap + fix arg error (#21950)

* core/vm/runtime: remove duplicated line (#21956)

This line is duplicated, though it doesn't cause any issues.

* core: improve contextual information on core errors (#21869)

A lot of times when we hit 'core' errors, example: invalid tx, the information provided is
insufficient. We miss several pieces of information: what account has nonce too high,
and what transaction in that block was offending?

This PR adds that information, using the new type of wrapped errors.
It also adds a testcase which (partly) verifies the output from the errors.

The first commit changes all usage of direct equality-checks on core errors, into
using errors.Is. The second commit adds contextual information. This wraps most
of the core errors with more information, and also wraps it one more time in
stateprocessor, to further provide tx index and tx hash, if such a tx is encoutered in
a block. The third commit uses the chainmaker to try to generate chains with such
errors in them, thus triggering the errors and checking that the generated string meets
expectations.

Go won't vendor C files if there are no Go files present in the directory.
Workaround is to add dummy Go files.

* accounts/abi/bind: allow specifying signer on transactOpts (#21356)

This commit enables users to specify which signer they want to use while creating their transactOpts.
Previously all contract interactions used the homestead signer. Now a user can specify whether they
want to sign with homestead or EIP155 and specify the chainID which adds another layer of security.

Closes #16484

* common: improve printing of Hash and Address (#21834)

Both Hash and Address have a String method, which returns the value as
hex with 0x prefix. They also had a Format method which tried to print
the value using printf of []byte. The way Format worked was at odds with
String though, leading to a situation where fmt.Sprintf(\"%v\", hash)
returned the decimal notation and hash.String() returned a hex string.

This commit makes it consistent again. Both types now support the %v,
%s, %q format verbs for 0x-prefixed hex output. %x, %X creates
unprefixed hex output. %d is also supported and returns the decimal
notation \"[1 2 3...]\".

For Address, the case of hex characters in %v, %s, %q output is
determined using the EIP-55 checksum. Using %x, %X with Address
disables checksumming.

* core,les: headerchain import in batches (#21471)

* core, light: write headerchains in batches

* core: change to one callback per batch of inserted headers + review concerns

* core: error-check on batch write

* core: unexport writeHeaders

* core: remove callback parameter in InsertHeaderChain

The semantics of InsertHeaderChain are now much simpler: it is now an
all-or-nothing operation. The new WriteStatus return value allows
callers to check for the canonicality of the insertion. This change
simplifies use of HeaderChain in package les, where the callback was
previously used to post chain events.

* crypto/signify, build: fix archive signing with signify (#21977)

This fixes some issues in crypto/signify and makes release signing work.

The archive signing step in ci.go used getenvBase64, which decodes the key data.
This is incorrect here because crypto/signify already base64-decodes the key.

* p2p/enode: avoid crashing for invalid IP (#21981)

The database panicked for invalid IPs. This is usually no problem
because all code paths leading to node DB access verify the IP, but it's
dangerous because improper validation can turn this panic into a DoS
vulnerability. The quick fix here is to just turn database accesses
using invalid IP into a noop. This isn't great, but I'm planning to
remove the node DB for discv5 long-term, so it should be fine to have
this quick fix for half a year.

Fixes #21849

This commit fixes a flaw in two testcases, and brings down the exec-time from ~40s to ~8s for trie/TestIncompleteSync.

The checkConsistency was performed over and over again on the complete set of nodes, not just the recently added, turning it into a quadratic runtime.

* metrics: zero temp variable in  updateMeter

Previously the temp variable was not updated properly after summing it to count.
This meant we had astronomically high metrics, now we zero out the temp whenever we
sum it onto the snapshot count

* metrics: move temp variable to be aligned, unit tests

Moves the temp variable in MeterSnapshot to be 64-bit aligned because of the atomic bug.
Adds a unit test, that catches the previous bug.

* p2p/discover: avoid dropping unverified nodes when table is almost empty (#21396)

This change improves discovery behavior in small networks. Very small
networks would often fail to bootstrap because all member nodes were
dropping table content due to findnode failure. The check is now changed
to avoid dropping nodes on findnode failure when their bucket is almost
empty. It also relaxes the liveness check requirement for FINDNODE/v4
response nodes, returning unverified nodes as results when there aren't
any verified nodes yet.

The \"findnode failed\" log now reports whether the node was dropped
instead of the number of results. The value of the \"results\" was
always zero by definition.

* go.mod : update goja dependency (#21432)

* eth/downloader: change intial download size (#21366)

This changes how the downloader works, a little bit. Previously, when block sync started,
we immediately started filling up to 8192 blocks. Usually this is fine, blocks are small
in the early numbers. The threshold then is lowered as we measure the size of the blocks
that are filled.

However, if the node is shut down and restarts syncing while we're in a heavy segment,
that might be bad. This PR introduces a more conservative initial threshold of 2K blocks
instead.

* miner: use channels instead of atomics in update loop (#21536)

This PR changes several different things:

- Uses channels instead of atomics in the miner.update() loop

* Dockerfile: unexpose port 8547 as GraphQL was merged into HTTP endpoint (#21556)

* p2p/nodestate: ensure correct callback order (#21436)

This PR adds an extra guarantee to NodeStateMachine: it ensures that all
immediate effects of a certain change are processed before any subsequent
effects of any of the immediate effects on the same node. In the original
version, if a cascaded change caused a subscription callback to be called
multiple times for the same node then these calls might have happened in a
wrong chronological order.

For example:

- a subscription to flag0 changes flag1 and flag2
- a subscription to flag1 changes flag3
- a subscription to flag1, flag2 and flag3 was called in the following order:

   [flag1] -> [flag1, flag3]
   [] -> [flag1]
   [flag1, flag3] -> [flag1, flag2, flag3]

This happened because the tree of changes was traversed in a \"depth-first
order\". Now it is traversed in a \"breadth-first order\"; each node has a
FIFO queue for pending callbacks and each triggered subscription callback
is added to the end of the list. The already existing guarantees are
retained; no SetState or SetField returns until the callback queue of the
node is empty again. Just like before, it is the responsibility of the
state machine design to ensure that infinite state loops are not possible.
Multiple changes affecting the same node can still happen simultaneously;
in this case the changes can be interleaved in the FIFO of the node but the
correct order is still guaranteed.

A new unit test is also added to verify callback order in the above scenario.

When the license was added to the repository, its text was changed (some

The correct way to apply GPL to a project is to copy it verbatim.
This change reverts the text of the GPL to the original.

According to the benchmarks, type assertion between the pointer and
interface is extremely fast.

BenchmarkIntmethod-12           1000000000               1.91 ns/op
BenchmarkInterface-12           1000000000               2.13 ns/op
BenchmarkTypeSwitch-12          1000000000               1.81 ns/op
BenchmarkTypeAssertion-12       2000000000               1.78 ns/op

So the overhead for asserting whether the shortnode has \"valuenode\"
child is super tiny. No necessary to have another field.

The go library commit that broke this is golang/go@97240d5, but the
way we used HKDF is slightly dodgy anyway and it's not a regression.

* miner: add test describing expectations for downloader/mining events

We expect that once the downloader emits a DoneEvent,
signaling a successful sync, that subsequent StartEvents
are not longer permitted to stop the miner.

This prevents a security vulnerability where forced syncs via

* miner: use 'canStop' state to fix downloader event handling

- Break downloader event handling into event

case when a downloader first succeeds.

* les, p2p/simulations/adapters: fix issues found while simulating les  (#21761)

This adds a few tiny fixes for les and the p2p simulation framework:

LES Parts

- Keep the LES-SERVER connection even it's non-synced

  We had this idea to reject the connections in LES protocol if the les-server itself is
  not synced. However, in LES protocol we will also receive the connection from another
  les-server. In this case even the local node is not synced yet, we should keep the tcp
  connection for other protocols(e.g. eth protocol).

- Don't count \"invalid message\" for non-existing GetBlockHeadersMsg request

  In the eth syncing mechanism (full sync, fast sync, light sync), it will try to fetch
  some non-existent blocks or headers(to ensure we indeed download all the missing chain).
  In this case, it's possible that the les-server will receive the request for
  non-existent headers. So don't count it as the \"invalid message\" for scheduling
  dropping.

- Copy the announce object in the closure

  Before the les-server pushes the latest headers to all connected clients, it will create
  a closure and queue it in the underlying request scheduler. In some scenarios it's
  problematic. E.g, in private networks, the block can be mined very fast. So before the
  first closure is executed, we may already update the latest_announce object. So actually
  the \"announce\" object we want to send is replaced.

  The downsize is the client will receive two announces with the same td and then drop the
  server.

P2P Simulation Framework

- Don't double register the protocol services in p2p-simulation \"Start\".

  The protocols upon the devp2p are registered in the \"New node stage\". So don't reigster
  them again when starting a node in the p2p simulation framework

- Add one more new config field \"ExternalSigner\", in order to use clef service in the
  framework.

* common: remove ToHex and ToHexArray (#21610)

ToHex was deprecated a couple years ago. The last remaining use
was in ToHexArray, which itself only had a single call site.

This just moves ToHexArray near its only remaining call site and
implements it using hexutil.Encode. This changes the default behaviour
of ToHexArray and with it the behaviour of eth_getProof. Previously we
encoded an empty slice as 0, now the empty slice is encoded as 0x.

* core/state/snapshot: fix journal recovery from generating old journal (#21775)

* core/state/snapshot: print warning if failed to resolve journal

* core/state/snapshot: fix snapshot recovery

When we meet the snapshot journal consisted with:
- disk layer generator with new-format
- diff layer journal with old-format

The base layer should be returned without error.
The broken diff layer can be reconstructed later
but we definitely don't want to reconstruct the
huge diff layer.

* core: add tests

* cmd/devp2p, internal/utesting: implement TAP output (#21760)

TAP is a text format for test results. Parsers for it are available in many languages,
making it easy to consume. I want TAP output from our protocol tests because the
Hive wrapper around them needs to know about the test names and their individual
results and logs. It would also be possible to just write this info as JSON, but I don't
want to invent a new format.

This also improves the normal console output for tests (when running without --tap).
It now prints -- RUN lines before any output from the test, and indents the log output
by one space.

* cmd/devp2p/internal/ethtest: add correct chain files and improve test output (#21782)

This PR replaces the old test genesis.json and chain.rlp files in the testdata
directory for the eth protocol test suite, and also adds documentation for
running the eth test suite locally.

It also improves the test output text and adds more timeouts.

* core/types, rlp: optimize derivesha (#21728)

This PR contains a minor optimization in derivesha, by exposing the RLP
int-encoding and making use of it to write integers directly to a
buffer (an RLP integer is known to never require more than 9 bytes
total). rlp.AppendUint64 might be useful in other places too.

The code assumes, just as before, that the hasher (a trie) will copy the
key internally, which it does when doing keybytesToHex(key).

- Don't register the services again in the node start.
  Registration is already done in the initialization stage.
- Expose admin namespace via websocket.
  This namespace is necessary for connecting the peers via websocket.
- Offer logging relevant options for exec adapter.
  It's really painful to mix all log output in the single console. So
  this PR offers two additional options for exec adapter in this case
  testers can config the log output(e.g. file output) and log level
  for each p2p node.

* signer/core/api: fix derivation of ledger live accounts

For ledger hardware wallets, change account iteration as follows:

- ledger legacy: m/44'/60'/0'/X; for 0<=X<5
- ledger live: m/44'/60'/0'/0/X; for 0<=X<5

- ledger legacy: m/44'/60'/0'/X; for 0<=X<10
- ledger live: m/44'/60'/X'/0/0; for 0<=X<10

Non-ledger derivation is unchanged and remains as:

* core/vm/runtime: remove duplicated line (#21956)

This line is duplicated, though it doesn't cause any issues.

* core: improve contextual information on core errors (#21869)

A lot of times when we hit 'core' errors, example: invalid tx, the information provided is
insufficient. We miss several pieces of information: what account has nonce too high,
and what transaction in that block was offending?

This PR adds that information, using the new type of wrapped errors.
It also adds a testcase which (partly) verifies the output from the errors.

The first commit changes all usage of direct equality-checks on core errors, into
using errors.Is. The second commit adds contextual information. This wraps most
of the core errors with more information, and also wraps it one more time in
stateprocessor, to further provide tx index and tx hash, if such a tx is encoutered in
a block. The third commit uses the chainmaker to try to generate chains with such
errors in them, thus triggering the errors and checking that the generated string meets
expectations.

* accounts/abi/bind: allow specifying signer on transactOpts (#21356)

This commit enables users to specify which signer they want to use while creating their transactOpts.
Previously all contract interactions used the homestead signer. Now a user can specify whether they
want to sign with homestead or EIP155 and specify the chainID which adds another layer of security.

Closes #16484

* common: improve printing of Hash and Address (#21834)

Both Hash and Address have a String method, which returns the value as
hex with 0x prefix. They also had a Format method which tried to print
the value using printf of []byte. The way Format worked was at odds with
String though, leading to a situation where fmt.Sprintf(\"%v\", hash)
returned the decimal notation and hash.String() returned a hex string.

This commit makes it consistent again. Both types now support the %v,
%s, %q format verbs for 0x-prefixed hex output. %x, %X creates
unprefixed hex output. %d is also supported and returns the decimal
notation \"[1 2 3...]\".

For Address, the case of hex characters in %v, %s, %q output is
determined using the EIP-55 checksum. Using %x, %X with Address
disables checksumming.

The semantics of InsertHeaderChain are now much simpler: it is now an

callers to check for the canonicality of the insertion. This change
simplifies use of HeaderChain in package les, where the callback was
previously used to post chain events.

This fixes some issues in crypto/signify and makes release signing work.

The archive signing step in ci.go used getenvBase64, which decodes the key data.
This is incorrect here because crypto/signify already base64-decodes the key.

* p2p/enode: avoid crashing for invalid IP (#21981)

The database panicked for invalid IPs. This is usually no problem
because all code paths leading to node DB access verify the IP, but it's
dangerous because improper validation can turn this panic into a DoS
vulnerability. The quick fix here is to just turn database accesses
using invalid IP into a noop. This isn't great, but I'm planning to
remove the node DB for discv5 long-term, so it should be fine to have
this quick fix for half a year.

Fixes #21849

Moves the temp variable in MeterSnapshot to be 64-bit aligned because of the atomic bug.

* p2p/discover: avoid dropping unverified nodes when table is almost empty (#21396)

This change improves discovery behavior in small networks. Very small
networks would often fail to bootstrap because all member nodes were
dropping table content due to findnode failure. The check is now changed
to avoid dropping nodes on findnode failure when their bucket is almost
empty. It also relaxes the liveness check requirement for FINDNODE/v4
response nodes, returning unverified nodes as results when there aren't
any verified nodes yet.

The "findnode failed" log now reports whether the node was dropped
instead of the number of results. The value of the "results" was
always zero by definition.

* go.mod : update goja dependency (#21432)

* eth/downloader: change intial download size (#21366)

This changes how the downloader works, a little bit. Previously, when block sync started,
we immediately started filling up to 8192 blocks. Usually this is fine, blocks are small
in the early numbers. The threshold then is lowered as we measure the size of the blocks
that are filled.

However, if the node is shut down and restarts syncing while we're in a heavy segment,
that might be bad. This PR introduces a more conservative initial threshold of 2K blocks
instead.

* miner: use channels instead of atomics in update loop (#21536)

This PR changes several different things:

- Adds test cases for the miner loop
- Stops the worker if it wasn't already stopped in worker.Close()
- Uses channels instead of atomics in the miner.update() loop

Co-authored-by: Felix Lange <fjl@twurst.com>

* miner: fix regression, add test for starting while download (#21547)

Fixes a regression introduced in #21536

* p2p/discover: fix typo in comments (#21554)

* Dockerfile: unexpose port 8547 as GraphQL was merged into HTTP endpoint (#21556)

* p2p/nodestate: ensure correct callback order (#21436)

This PR adds an extra guarantee to NodeStateMachine: it ensures that all
immediate effects of a certain change are processed before any subsequent
effects of any of the immediate effects on the same node. In the original
version, if a cascaded change caused a subscription callback to be called
multiple times for the same node then these calls might have happened in a
wrong chronological order.

For example:

- a subscription to flag0 changes flag1 and flag2
- a subscription to flag1 changes flag3
- a subscription to flag1, flag2 and flag3 was called in the following order:

   [flag1] -> [flag1, flag3]
   [] -> [flag1]
   [flag1, flag3] -> [flag1, flag2, flag3]

This happened because the tree of changes was traversed in a "depth-first
order". Now it is traversed in a "breadth-first order"; each node has a
FIFO queue for pending callbacks and each triggered subscription callback
is added to the end of the list. The already existing guarantees are
retained; no SetState or SetField returns until the callback queue of the
node is empty again. Just like before, it is the responsibility of the
state machine design to ensure that infinite state loops are not possible.
Multiple changes affecting the same node can still happen simultaneously;
in this case the changes can be interleaved in the FIFO of the node but the
correct order is still guaranteed.

A new unit test is also added to verify callback order in the above scenario.

When the license was added to the repository, its text was changed (some

The correct way to apply GPL to a project is to copy it verbatim.
This change reverts the text of the GPL to the original.

According to the benchmarks, type assertion between the pointer and
interface is extremely fast.

BenchmarkIntmethod-12           1000000000               1.91 ns/op
BenchmarkInterface-12           1000000000               2.13 ns/op
BenchmarkTypeSwitch-12          1000000000               1.81 ns/op
BenchmarkTypeAssertion-12       2000000000               1.78 ns/op

So the overhead for asserting whether the shortnode has "valuenode"
child is super tiny. No necessary to have another field.

We expect that once the downloader emits a DoneEvent,

* les, p2p/simulations/adapters: fix issues found while simulating les  (#21761)

This adds a few tiny fixes for les and the p2p simulation framework:

LES Parts

- Keep the LES-SERVER connection even it's non-synced

  We had this idea to reject the connections in LES protocol if the les-server itself is
  not synced. However, in LES protocol we will also receive the connection from another
  les-server. In this case even the local node is not synced yet, we should keep the tcp
  connection for other protocols(e.g. eth protocol).

- Don't count "invalid message" for non-existing GetBlockHeadersMsg request

  In the eth syncing mechanism (full sync, fast sync, light sync), it will try to fetch
  some non-existent blocks or headers(to ensure we indeed download all the missing chain).
  In this case, it's possible that the les-server will receive the request for
  non-existent headers. So don't count it as the "invalid message" for scheduling
  dropping.

- Copy the announce object in the closure

  Before the les-server pushes the latest headers to all connected clients, it will create
  a closure and queue it in the underlying request scheduler. In some scenarios it's
  problematic. E.g, in private networks, the block can be mined very fast. So before the
  first closure is executed, we may already update the latest_announce object. So actually
  the "announce" object we want to send is replaced.

  The downsize is the client will receive two announces with the same td and then drop the
  server.

P2P Simulation Framework

- Don't double register the protocol services in p2p-simulation "Start".

  The protocols upon the devp2p are registered in the "New node stage". So don't reigster
  them again when starting a node in the p2p simulation framework

- Add one more new config field "ExternalSigner", in order to use clef service in the
  framework.

* common: remove ToHex and ToHexArray (#21610)

ToHex was deprecated a couple years ago. The last remaining use
was in ToHexArray, which itself only had a single call site.

This just moves ToHexArray near its only remaining call site and
implements it using hexutil.Encode. This changes the default behaviour
of ToHexArray and with it the behaviour of eth_getProof. Previously we
encoded an empty slice as 0, now the empty slice is encoded as 0x.

* core/state/snapshot: fix journal recovery from generating old journal (#21775)

* core/state/snapshot: print warning if failed to resolve journal

* core/state/snapshot: fix snapshot recovery

When we meet the snapshot journal consisted with:
- disk layer generator with new-format
- diff layer journal with old-format

The base layer should be returned without error.
The broken diff layer can be reconstructed later
but we definitely don't want to reconstruct the
huge diff layer.

* core: add tests

* cmd/devp2p, internal/utesting: implement TAP output (#21760)

TAP is a text format for test results. Parsers for it are available in many languages,
making it easy to consume. I want TAP output from our protocol tests because the
Hive wrapper around them needs to know about the test names and their individual
results and logs. It would also be possible to just write this info as JSON, but I don't
want to invent a new format.

This also improves the normal console output for tests (when running without --tap).
It now prints -- RUN lines before any output from the test, and indents the log output
by one space.

* cmd/devp2p/internal/ethtest: add correct chain files and improve test output (#21782)

This PR replaces the old test genesis.json and chain.rlp files in the testdata
directory for the eth protocol test suite, and also adds documentation for
running the eth test suite locally.

It also improves the test output text and adds more timeouts.

* core/types, rlp: optimize derivesha (#21728)

This PR contains a minor optimization in derivesha, by exposing the RLP
int-encoding and making use of it to write integers directly to a
buffer (an RLP integer is known to never require more than 9 bytes
total). rlp.AppendUint64 might be useful in other places too.

The code assumes, just as before, that the hasher (a trie) will copy the
key internally, which it does when doing keybytesToHex(key).

  Registration is already done in the initialization stage.
- Expose admin namespace via websocket.
  This namespace is necessary for connecting the peers via websocket.
- Offer logging relevant options for exec adapter.
  It's really painful to mix all log output in the single console. So
  this PR offers two additional options for exec adapter in this case
  testers can config the log output(e.g. file output) and log level
  for each p2p node.

* scripts: create oss-fuzz script in go-ethereum (#21808)

* fuzzers: removed fuzzbuzz configuration (#21813)

We decided to move our fuzzing efforts to oss-fuzz since fuzzbuzz is still early access.

* build: add -dlgo flag in ci.go (#21824)

This new flag downloads a known version of Go and builds with it. This
is meant for environments where we can't easily upgrade the installed Go
version.

* .travis.yml: remove install step for PR test builders

We added this step originally to avoid re-building everything
for every test. go test has become much smarter in recent go
releases, so we no longer need to install anything here.

This fixes cross-build and mobile framework failures.
It also disables the mac test builder because it was failing
all the time in hard to understand ways and we can't afford
it anymore under Travis CI's new pricing.

The z == 0 check is hit whenever we Add two points with the same x1/x2

function. This change does not affect block processing or tx signature verification
in any way, because it does not use the Add or Double methods.

Adds originIsAllowed() & ruleAllowsOrigin(); removes prepOriginForComparison

Remove blank line

Added tests for simple allowed-orign rule

which does not specify a protocol or port, just a hostname

Fix copy-paste: `:=` => `=`

Remove autoadded whitespace on blank lines

Compare scheme, hostname, and port with rule

if the rule specifies those portions.

Remove one autoadded trailing whitespace

Better handle case where only origin host is given

* accounts, signer: fix Ledger Live account derivation path (clef) (#21757)

* signer/core/api: fix derivation of ledger live accounts

For ledger hardware wallets, change account iteration as follows:

- ledger legacy: m/44'/60'/0'/X; for 0<=X<5
- ledger live: m/44'/60'/0'/0/X; for 0<=X<5

- ledger legacy: m/44'/60'/0'/X; for 0<=X<10
- ledger live: m/44'/60'/X'/0/0; for 0<=X<10

Non-ledger derivation is unchanged and remains as:
- non-ledger: m/44'/60'/0'/0/X; for 0<=X<10

* signer/core/api: derive ten default paths for all hardware wallets, plus ten legacy and ten live paths for ledger wallets

* signer/core/api: as .../0'/0/0 already included by default paths, do not include it again with ledger live paths

* p2p/nodestate: fix deadlock during shutdown of les server (#21927)

This PR fixes a deadlock reported here: #21925

The cause is that many operations may be pending, but if the close happens, only one of them gets awoken and exits, the others remain waiting for a signal that never comes.

* cmd/devp2p: add node filter for snap + fix arg error (#21950)

* core/vm/runtime: remove duplicated line (#21956)

This line is duplicated, though it doesn't cause any issues.

* core: improve contextual information on core errors (#21869)

A lot of times when we hit 'core' errors, example: invalid tx, the information provided is
insufficient. We miss several pieces of information: what account has nonce too high,
and what transaction in that block was offending?

This PR adds that information, using the new type of wrapped errors.
It also adds a testcase which (partly) verifies the output from the errors.

The first commit changes all usage of direct equality-checks on core errors, into
using errors.Is. The second commit adds contextual information. This wraps most
of the core errors with more information, and also wraps it one more time in
stateprocessor, to further provide tx index and tx hash, if such a tx is encoutered in
a block. The third commit uses the chainmaker to try to generate chains with such
errors in them, thus triggering the errors and checking that the generated string meets
expectations.

* crypto/secp256k1: add workaround for go mod vendor (#21735)

Go won't vendor C files if there are no Go files present in the directory.
Workaround is to add dummy Go files.

Fixes: #20232

* accounts/abi/bind: allow specifying signer on transactOpts (#21356)

This commit enables users to specify which signer they want to use while creating their transactOpts.
Previously all contract interactions used the homestead signer. Now a user can specify whether they
want to sign with homestead or EIP155 and specify the chainID which adds another layer of security.

Closes #16484

* common: improve printing of Hash and Address (#21834)

Both Hash and Address have a String method, which returns the value as
hex with 0x prefix. They also had a Format method which tried to print
the value using printf of []byte. The way Format worked was at odds with
String though, leading to a situation where fmt.Sprintf("%v", hash)
returned the decimal notation and hash.String() returned a hex string.

This commit makes it consistent again. Both types now support the %v,
%s, %q format verbs for 0x-prefixed hex output. %x, %X creates
unprefixed hex output. %d is also supported and returns the decimal
notation "[1 2 3...]".

For Address, the case of hex characters in %v, %s, %q output is
determined using the EIP-55 checksum. Using %x, %X with Address
disables checksumming.

* core,les: headerchain import in batches (#21471)

* core: add test for headerchain inserts

* core, light: write headerchains in batches

* core: change to one callback per batch of inserted headers + review concerns

* core: error-check on batch write

* core: unexport writeHeaders

* core: remove callback parameter in InsertHeaderChain

The semantics of InsertHeaderChain are now much simpler: it is now an
all-or-nothing operation. The new WriteStatus return value allows
callers to check for the canonicality of the insertion. This change
simplifies use of HeaderChain in package les, where the callback was
previously used to post chain events.

* core: skip some hashing when writing headers

* cmd/geth: add test to verify regexps in version check (#21962)

* crypto/signify, build: fix archive signing with signify (#21977)

This fixes some issues in crypto/signify and makes release signing work.

The archive signing step in ci.go used getenvBase64, which decodes the key data.
This is incorrect here because crypto/signify already base64-decodes the key.

* p2p/enode: avoid crashing for invalid IP (#21981)

The database panicked for invalid IPs. This is usually no problem
because all code paths leading to node DB access verify the IP, but it's
dangerous because improper validation can turn this panic into a DoS
vulnerability. The quick fix here is to just turn database accesses
using invalid IP into a noop. This isn't great, but I'm planning to
remove the node DB for discv5 long-term, so it should be fine to have
this quick fix for half a year.

Fixes #21849

* les, light: remove untrusted header retrieval in ODR

* core, trie: speed up some tests with quadratic processing flaw (#21987)

This commit fixes a flaw in two testcases, and brings down the exec-time from ~40s to ~8s for trie/TestIncompleteSync.

The checkConsistency was performed over and over again on the complete set of nodes, not just the recently added, turning it into a quadratic runtime.

Automated builds are available for stable releases and the unstable master branch. Binary
archives are published at <https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/>.

## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.22 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```
make all
```

## Executables

The go-ethereum project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`geth`** | Our main Ethereum CLI client. It is the entry point into the Ethereum network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [CLI page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options) for command line options. |
| `clef` | Stand-alone signing tool, which can be used as a backend signer for `geth`. |
| `devp2p` | Utilities to interact with nodes on the networking layer, without running a full blockchain. |
| `abigen` | Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy-to-use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However, it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see our [Native DApps](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/dapp-developer/native-bindings) page for details. |
| `evm` | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug run`). |
| `rlpdump` | Developer utility tool to convert binary RLP ([Recursive Length Prefix](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp)) dumps (data encoding used by the Ethereum protocol both network as well as consensus wise) to user-friendlier hierarchical representation (e.g. `rlpdump --hex CE0183FFFFFFC4C304050583616263`). |

## Running `geth`

Going through all the possible command line flags is out of scope here (please consult our
[CLI Wiki page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options)),
but we've enumerated a few common parameter combos to get you up to speed quickly
on how you can run your own `geth` instance.

### Hardware Requirements

Minimum:

* CPU with 4+ cores
* 8GB RAM
* 1TB free storage space to sync the Mainnet
* 8 MBit/sec download Internet service

Recommended:

* Fast CPU with 8+ cores
* 16GB+ RAM
* High-performance SSD with at least 1TB of free space
* 25+ MBit/sec download Internet service

### Full node on the main Ethereum network

By far the most common scenario is people wanting to simply interact with the Ethereum
network: create accounts; transfer funds; deploy and interact with contracts. For this
particular use case, the user doesn't care about years-old historical data, so we can
sync quickly to the current state of the network. To do so:

```
$ geth console
```

This command will:

* Start `geth` in snap sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag),
  causing it to download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history
  of the Ethereum network, which is very CPU intensive.
* Start the built-in interactive [JavaScript console](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/javascript-console),
  (via the trailing `console` subcommand) through which you can interact using [`web3` methods](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js/blob/0.20.7/DOCUMENTATION.md)
  (note: the `web3` version bundled within `geth` is very old, and not up to date with official docs),
  as well as `geth`'s own [management APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc).
  This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach it to an already running
  `geth` instance with `geth attach`.

### A Full node on the Holesky test network

Transitioning towards developers, if you'd like to play around with creating Ethereum
contracts, you almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until
you get the hang of the entire system. In other words, instead of attaching to the main
network, you want to join the **test** network with your node, which is fully equivalent to
the main network, but with play-Ether only.

```
$ geth --holesky console
```

The `console` subcommand has the same meaning as above and is equally
useful on the testnet too.

Specifying the `--holesky` flag, however, will reconfigure your `geth` instance a bit:

* Instead of connecting to the main Ethereum network, the client will connect to the Holesky
  test network, which uses different P2P bootnodes, different network IDs and genesis
  states.
* Instead of using the default data directory (`~/.ethereum` on Linux for example), `geth`
  will nest itself one level deeper into a `holesky` subfolder (`~/.ethereum/holesky` on
  Linux). Note, on OSX and Linux this also means that attaching to a running testnet node
  requires the use of a custom endpoint since `geth attach` will try to attach to a
  production node endpoint by default, e.g.,
  `geth attach <datadir>/holesky/geth.ipc`. Windows users are not affected by
  this.

*Note: Although some internal protective measures prevent transactions from
crossing over between the main network and test network, you should always
use separate accounts for play and real money. Unless you manually move
accounts, `geth` will by default correctly separate the two networks and will not make any
accounts available between them.*

### Configuration

As an alternative to passing the numerous flags to the `geth` binary, you can also pass a
configuration file via:

```
$ geth --config /path/to/your_config.toml
```

To get an idea of how the file should look like you can use the `dumpconfig` subcommand to
export your existing configuration:

```
$ geth --your-favourite-flags dumpconfig
```

#### Docker quick start

One of the quickest ways to get Ethereum up and running on your machine is by using
Docker:

```
docker run -d --name ethereum-node -v /Users/alice/ethereum:/root \
           -p 8545:8545 -p 30303:30303 \
           ethereum/client-go
```

This will start `geth` in snap-sync mode with a DB memory allowance of 1GB, as the
above command does. It will also create a persistent volume in your home directory for
saving your blockchain as well as map the default ports. There is also an `alpine` tag
available for a slim version of the image.

Do not forget `--http.addr 0.0.0.0`, if you want to access RPC from other containers
and/or hosts. By default, `geth` binds to the local interface and RPC endpoints are not
accessible from the outside.

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
Ethereum network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/)
and [`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

* `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
* `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
* `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
* `--http.api` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
* `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
* `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
* `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
* `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
* `--ws.api` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
* `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept WebSocket requests
* `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
* `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you'll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
Ethereum nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**

### Operating a private network

Maintaining your own private network is more involved as a lot of configurations taken for
granted in the official networks need to be manually set up.

Unfortunately since [the Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/) it is no longer possible
to easily set up a network of geth nodes without also setting up a corresponding beacon chain.

There are three different solutions depending on your use case:

* If you are looking for a simple way to test smart contracts from go in your CI, you can use the [Simulated Backend](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/dapp-developer/native-bindings#blockchain-simulator).
* If you want a convenient single node environment for testing, you can use our [Dev Mode](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/dapp-developer/dev-mode).
* If you are looking for a multiple node test network, you can set one up quite easily with [Kurtosis](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/kurtosis).

Fixes [#21543](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/21543). This produces a file than can then be verified with signify:

```
$ signify-openbsd -V -p pubkey -x sigfile -m archive

```

Sorry, something went wrong.

Wow, this looks really funky! At a glance, it looks like you're just happily appending the private key to the `sigdata`, which is then output in the message.

Not until one checks into `readSKey`, it becomes apparent that the private part after the first `40` bytes, which is not included here.

Perhaps you can make this more obvious, like

```
privKey := keydata[40:]
pubKey := keydata[32:40]
...
sigdata = append(sigdata, pubKey...)

```

Also, I don't quite understand -- what is sitting on bytes `2-32`, which is totally ignored?

Sorry, something went wrong.

2-32 it contains data that is indicative of how the key got generated and also a checksum, which is not to be published in the signature.

How does the `signify-openbsd` behave ?  `signify-openbsd` uses `.sig` as described in its manpage <https://man.openbsd.org/signify.1>  From what I see `signify` is the older format as it got introduced in 5.5 which came out ages ago. This being said, `minisign` seems older than its github history. I'm at a loss for a clear sign of which format should have precedence. |

Maybe you could turn this into `parsePrivateKey(pKey []byte) ((ed25519.PrivateKey, hdr []byte, keyId []byte, error)`. Then the key format wouldn't be as "spread out", and you wouldn't keep working on the `keydata` buffer (which contains secret data) after calling this method.

Afaict, this allows arbitrarily many `CR` or `LF` characters to be placed anywhere?

A one-liner to me means that it contains exactly one or zero `CR` *or* `CRLF`, and that is placed at the end.

the code is correct, it's the function name that is wrong. It should be `commentMoreThanOneLine`. If this returns `true`, then an error will be returned.

The go-minisign verifier does this:

```
	lines := strings.SplitN(in, "\n", 4)

```

So it totally ignores `CR` and counts only `LF`.

Maybe it's not true in Go, but `\n` is OS-dependent in C, so it could be `CR`, `LF`, or both (don't have Windows/MacOS, can't check that). Maybe [@fjl](https://github.com/fjl) can chime in here? I could remove the check for `LF` but I want to make sure that it's going to work on Windows/MacOS.

On unix-systems, `\n` (`LF`) is used, whereas windows uses `\r\n` (`CRLF`). We should we stick to whatever signify and\_or minisign does, and hopefully both of them behaves the same way.

If they allow "lalalal \r lolo \r foo bar\n" then we should do that too

this is what I said, and MacOS only uses `CR` in some modes. However, I guess `go-minisign` will behave the same on every platform, which means that it will expect `CR` only. I just tested `signify-openbsd` and it's ignoring `LF`. So I assume there is no need to test on Windows/MacOS after all.

* metrics: zero temp variable in  updateMeter (#21470)

* metrics: zero temp variable in  updateMeter

Previously the temp variable was not updated properly after summing it to count.
This meant we had astronomically high metrics, now we zero out the temp whenever we
sum it onto the snapshot count

* metrics: move temp variable to be aligned, unit tests

Moves the temp variable in MeterSnapshot to be 64-bit aligned because of the atomic bug.
Adds a unit test, that catches the previous bug.

* eth/downloader, eth/handler: utilize sync bloom for getNodeData

* trie: handle if bloom is nil

* trie, downloader: check bloom nilness externally

* core/state/snapshot: reduce disk layer depth during generation

* p2p/discover: avoid dropping unverified nodes when table is almost empty (#21396)

This change improves discovery behavior in small networks. Very small
networks would often fail to bootstrap because all member nodes were
dropping table content due to findnode failure. The check is now changed
to avoid dropping nodes on findnode failure when their bucket is almost
empty. It also relaxes the liveness check requirement for FINDNODE/v4
response nodes, returning unverified nodes as results when there aren't
any verified nodes yet.

The \"findnode failed\" log now reports whether the node was dropped
instead of the number of results. The value of the \"results\" was
always zero by definition.

* \"Downloader queue stats\" is now provided once per minute (#21455)

* \"Downloader queue stats\" is now a DEBUG information

I think this info is more a DEBUG related information then an INFO. If it must remains an INFO, maybe it can be slow down to one time every 5 minutes or so.

* Update queue.go

\"Downloader queue stats\" information is now provided once every minute instead of once every 10 seconds.

* go.mod : update goja dependency (#21432)

* eth/downloader: change intial download size (#21366)

This changes how the downloader works, a little bit. Previously, when block sync started,
we immediately started filling up to 8192 blocks. Usually this is fine, blocks are small
in the early numbers. The threshold then is lowered as we measure the size of the blocks
that are filled.

However, if the node is shut down and restarts syncing while we're in a heavy segment,
that might be bad. This PR introduces a more conservative initial threshold of 2K blocks
instead.

* miner: use channels instead of atomics in update loop (#21536)

This PR changes several different things:

- Adds test cases for the miner loop
- Stops the worker if it wasn't already stopped in worker.Close()
- Uses channels instead of atomics in the miner.update() loop

Co-authored-by: Felix Lange <fjl@twurst.com>

* miner: fix regression, add test for starting while download (#21547)

Fixes a regression introduced in #21536

* p2p/discover: fix typo in comments (#21554)

* Dockerfile: unexpose port 8547 as GraphQL was merged into HTTP endpoint (#21556)

* p2p/nodestate: ensure correct callback order (#21436)

This PR adds an extra guarantee to NodeStateMachine: it ensures that all
immediate effects of a certain change are processed before any subsequent
effects of any of the immediate effects on the same node. In the original
version, if a cascaded change caused a subscription callback to be called
multiple times for the same node then these calls might have happened in a
wrong chronological order.

For example:

- a subscription to flag0 changes flag1 and flag2
- a subscription to flag1 changes flag3
- a subscription to flag1, flag2 and flag3 was called in the following order:

   [flag1] -> [flag1, flag3]
   [] -> [flag1]
   [flag1, flag3] -> [flag1, flag2, flag3]

This happened because the tree of changes was traversed in a \"depth-first
order\". Now it is traversed in a \"breadth-first order\"; each node has a
FIFO queue for pending callbacks and each triggered subscription callback
is added to the end of the list. The already existing guarantees are
retained; no SetState or SetField returns until the callback queue of the
node is empty again. Just like before, it is the responsibility of the
state machine design to ensure that infinite state loops are not possible.
Multiple changes affecting the same node can still happen simultaneously;
in this case the changes can be interleaved in the FIFO of the node but the
correct order is still guaranteed.

A new unit test is also added to verify callback order in the above scenario.

* eth/tracers: regenerate assets from #21549 (#21564)

* COYPING: restore the full text text of GPL (#21568)

When the license was added to the repository, its text was changed (some
sections at the end removed) and, worse, the authors of go-ethereum
tried to claim copyright on the license text.

The correct way to apply GPL to a project is to copy it verbatim.
This change reverts the text of the GPL to the original.

* core/rawdb: single point of maintenance for writing and deleting tx lookup indexes (#21480)

* ethclient: fix BlockNumber (#21565)

It didn't actually work because it called a method that doesn't
exist. This fixes it also adds a test.

According to the benchmarks, type assertion between the pointer and
interface is extremely fast.

BenchmarkIntmethod-12           1000000000               1.91 ns/op
BenchmarkInterface-12           1000000000               2.13 ns/op
BenchmarkTypeSwitch-12          1000000000               1.81 ns/op
BenchmarkTypeAssertion-12       2000000000               1.78 ns/op

So the overhead for asserting whether the shortnode has \"valuenode\"
child is super tiny. No necessary to have another field.

We expect that once the downloader emits a DoneEvent,

* les, p2p/simulations/adapters: fix issues found while simulating les  (#21761)

This adds a few tiny fixes for les and the p2p simulation framework:

LES Parts

- Keep the LES-SERVER connection even it's non-synced

  We had this idea to reject the connections in LES protocol if the les-server itself is
  not synced. However, in LES protocol we will also receive the connection from another
  les-server. In this case even the local node is not synced yet, we should keep the tcp
  connection for other protocols(e.g. eth protocol).

- Don't count \"invalid message\" for non-existing GetBlockHeadersMsg request

  In the eth syncing mechanism (full sync, fast sync, light sync), it will try to fetch
  some non-existent blocks or headers(to ensure we indeed download all the missing chain).
  In this case, it's possible that the les-server will receive the request for
  non-existent headers. So don't count it as the \"invalid message\" for scheduling
  dropping.

- Copy the announce object in the closure

  Before the les-server pushes the latest headers to all connected clients, it will create
  a closure and queue it in the underlying request scheduler. In some scenarios it's
  problematic. E.g, in private networks, the block can be mined very fast. So before the
  first closure is executed, we may already update the latest_announce object. So actually
  the \"announce\" object we want to send is replaced.

  The downsize is the client will receive two announces with the same td and then drop the
  server.

P2P Simulation Framework

- Don't double register the protocol services in p2p-simulation \"Start\".

  The protocols upon the devp2p are registered in the \"New node stage\". So don't reigster
  them again when starting a node in the p2p simulation framework

- Add one more new config field \"ExternalSigner\", in order to use clef service in the
  framework.

* common: remove ToHex and ToHexArray (#21610)

ToHex was deprecated a couple years ago. The last remaining use
was in ToHexArray, which itself only had a single call site.

This just moves ToHexArray near its only remaining call site and
implements it using hexutil.Encode. This changes the default behaviour
of ToHexArray and with it the behaviour of eth_getProof. Previously we
encoded an empty slice as 0, now the empty slice is encoded as 0x.

* core/state/snapshot: fix journal recovery from generating old journal (#21775)

* core/state/snapshot: print warning if failed to resolve journal

* core/state/snapshot: fix snapshot recovery

When we meet the snapshot journal consisted with:
- disk layer generator with new-format
- diff layer journal with old-format

The base layer should be returned without error.
The broken diff layer can be reconstructed later
but we definitely don't want to reconstruct the
huge diff layer.

* core: add tests

* cmd/devp2p, internal/utesting: implement TAP output (#21760)

TAP is a text format for test results. Parsers for it are available in many languages,
making it easy to consume. I want TAP output from our protocol tests because the
Hive wrapper around them needs to know about the test names and their individual
results and logs. It would also be possible to just write this info as JSON, but I don't
want to invent a new format.

This also improves the normal console output for tests (when running without --tap).
It now prints -- RUN lines before any output from the test, and indents the log output
by one space.

* cmd/devp2p/internal/ethtest: add correct chain files and improve test output (#21782)

This PR replaces the old test genesis.json and chain.rlp files in the testdata
directory for the eth protocol test suite, and also adds documentation for
running the eth test suite locally.

It also improves the test output text and adds more timeouts.

* core/types, rlp: optimize derivesha (#21728)

This PR contains a minor optimization in derivesha, by exposing the RLP
int-encoding and making use of it to write integers directly to a
buffer (an RLP integer is known to never require more than 9 bytes
total). rlp.AppendUint64 might be useful in other places too.

The code assumes, just as before, that the hasher (a trie) will copy the
key internally, which it does when doing keybytesToHex(key).

  Registration is already done in the initialization stage.
- Expose admin namespace via websocket.
  This namespace is necessary for connecting the peers via websocket.
- Offer logging relevant options for exec adapter.
  It's really painful to mix all log output in the single console. So
  this PR offers two additional options for exec adapter in this case

  for each p2p node.

function. This change does not affect block processing or tx signature verification

Also using a helper function for ToLower consolidates all preparation steps in one function for more maintainable consistency.

Spaces => tabs

Remove a semicolon

Add space at start of comment

Remove parens around conditional

Handle case wehre parsed hostname is empty

When passing a single word like \"localhost\" the parsed hostname is an empty string. Handle this and the error-parsing case together as default, and the nonempty hostname case in the conditional.

Refactor with new originIsAllowed functions

Adds originIsAllowed() & ruleAllowsOrigin(); removes prepOriginForComparison

Remove blank line

Added tests for simple allowed-orign rule

which does not specify a protocol or port, just a hostname

Fix copy-paste: `:=` => `=`

Remove parens around conditional

Remove autoadded whitespace on blank lines

Compare scheme, hostname, and port with rule

if the rule specifies those portions.

Remove one autoadded trailing whitespace

Better handle case where only origin host is given

e.g. \"localhost\"

Remove parens around conditional

For ledger hardware wallets, change account iteration as follows:

- ledger legacy: m/44'/60'/0'/X; for 0<=X<10

This line is duplicated, though it doesn't cause any issues.

* core: improve contextual information on core errors (#21869)

A lot of times when we hit 'core' errors, example: invalid tx, the information provided is
insufficient. We miss several pieces of information: what account has nonce too high,
and what transaction in that block was offending?

This PR adds that information, using the new type of wrapped errors.
It also adds a testcase which (partly) verifies the output from the errors.

The first commit changes all usage of direct equality-checks on core errors, into
using errors.Is. The second commit adds contextual information. This wraps most
of the core errors with more information, and also wraps it one more time in
stateprocessor, to further provide tx index and tx hash, if such a tx is encoutered in
a block. The third commit uses the chainmaker to try to generate chains with such
errors in them, thus triggering the errors and checking that the generated string meets
expectations.

* accounts/abi/bind: allow specifying signer on transactOpts (#21356)

This commit enables users to specify which signer they want to use while creating their transactOpts.
Previously all contract interactions used the homestead signer. Now a user can specify whether they
want to sign with homestead or EIP155 and specify the chainID which adds another layer of security.

Closes #16484

* common: improve printing of Hash and Address (#21834)

Both Hash and Address have a String method, which returns the value as
hex with 0x prefix. They also had a Format method which tried to print
the value using printf of []byte. The way Format worked was at odds with
String though, leading to a situation where fmt.Sprintf(\"%v\", hash)
returned the decimal notation and hash.String() returned a hex string.

This commit makes it consistent again. Both types now support the %v,
%s, %q format verbs for 0x-prefixed hex output. %x, %X creates
unprefixed hex output. %d is also supported and returns the decimal
notation \"[1 2 3...]\".

For Address, the case of hex characters in %v, %s, %q output is
determined using the EIP-55 checksum. Using %x, %X with Address
disables checksumming.

The semantics of InsertHeaderChain are now much simpler: it is now an

callers to check for the canonicality of the insertion. This change
simplifies use of HeaderChain in package les, where the callback was
previously used to post chain events.

This fixes some issues in crypto/signify and makes release signing work.

The archive signing step in ci.go used getenvBase64, which decodes the key data.
This is incorrect here because crypto/signify already base64-decodes the key.

* p2p/enode: avoid crashing for invalid IP (#21981)

The database panicked for invalid IPs. This is usually no problem
because all code paths leading to node DB access verify the IP, but it's
dangerous because improper validation can turn this panic into a DoS
vulnerability. The quick fix here is to just turn database accesses
using invalid IP into a noop. This isn't great, but I'm planning to
remove the node DB for discv5 long-term, so it should be fine to have
this quick fix for half a year.

* metrics: zero temp variable in  updateMeter

Previously the temp variable was not updated properly after summing it to count.
This meant we had astronomically high metrics, now we zero out the temp whenever we
sum it onto the snapshot count

Moves the temp variable in MeterSnapshot to be 64-bit aligned because of the atomic bug.
Adds a unit test, that catches the previous bug.

* core/state/snapshot: reduce disk layer depth during generation

* p2p/discover: avoid dropping unverified nodes when table is almost empty (#21396)

This change improves discovery behavior in small networks. Very small
networks would often fail to bootstrap because all member nodes were
dropping table content due to findnode failure. The check is now changed
to avoid dropping nodes on findnode failure when their bucket is almost
empty. It also relaxes the liveness check requirement for FINDNODE/v4
response nodes, returning unverified nodes as results when there aren't
any verified nodes yet.

The \"findnode failed\" log now reports whether the node was dropped
instead of the number of results. The value of the \"results\" was
always zero by definition.

* go.mod : update goja dependency (#21432)

* eth/downloader: change intial download size (#21366)

This changes how the downloader works, a little bit. Previously, when block sync started,
we immediately started filling up to 8192 blocks. Usually this is fine, blocks are small
in the early numbers. The threshold then is lowered as we measure the size of the blocks
that are filled.

However, if the node is shut down and restarts syncing while we're in a heavy segment,
that might be bad. This PR introduces a more conservative initial threshold of 2K blocks

* miner: use channels instead of atomics in update loop (#21536)

This PR changes several different things:

- Adds test cases for the miner loop
- Stops the worker if it wasn't already stopped in worker.Close()
- Uses channels instead of atomics in the miner.update() loop

Co-authored-by: Felix Lange <fjl@twurst.com>

* miner: fix regression, add test for starting while download (#21547)

Fixes a regression introduced in #21536

* p2p/discover: fix typo in comments (#21554)

* Dockerfile: unexpose port 8547 as GraphQL was merged into HTTP endpoint (#21556)

* p2p/nodestate: ensure correct callback order (#21436)

This PR adds an extra guarantee to NodeStateMachine: it ensures that all
immediate effects of a certain change are processed before any subsequent
effects of any of the immediate effects on the same node. In the original
version, if a cascaded change caused a subscription callback to be called
multiple times for the same node then these calls might have happened in a
wrong chronological order.

For example:

- a subscription to flag0 changes flag1 and flag2
- a subscription to flag1 changes flag3
- a subscription to flag1, flag2 and flag3 was called in the following order:

   [flag1] -> [flag1, flag3]
   [] -> [flag1]
   [flag1, flag3] -> [flag1, flag2, flag3]

This happened because the tree of changes was traversed in a \"depth-first
order\". Now it is traversed in a \"breadth-first order\"; each node has a
FIFO queue for pending callbacks and each triggered subscription callback
is added to the end of the list. The already existing guarantees are
retained; no SetState or SetField returns until the callback queue of the
node is empty again. Just like before, it is the responsibility of the
state machine design to ensure that infinite state loops are not possible.
Multiple changes affecting the same node can still happen simultaneously;
in this case the changes can be interleaved in the FIFO of the node but the
correct order is still guaranteed.

A new unit test is also added to verify callback order in the above scenario.

The correct way to apply GPL to a project is to copy it verbatim.
This change reverts the text of the GPL to the original.

According to the benchmarks, type assertion between the pointer and
interface is extremely fast.

BenchmarkIntmethod-12           1000000000               1.91 ns/op
BenchmarkInterface-12           1000000000               2.13 ns/op
BenchmarkTypeSwitch-12          1000000000               1.81 ns/op
BenchmarkTypeAssertion-12       2000000000               1.78 ns/op

So the overhead for asserting whether the shortnode has \"valuenode\"
child is super tiny. No necessary to have another field.

We expect that once the downloader emits a DoneEvent,

LES Parts

- Keep the LES-SERVER connection even it's non-synced

  We had this idea to reject the connections in LES protocol if the les-server itself is
  not synced. However, in LES protocol we will also receive the connection from another
  les-server. In this case even the local node is not synced yet, we should keep the tcp
  connection for other protocols(e.g. eth protocol).

- Don't count \"invalid message\" for non-existing GetBlockHeadersMsg request

  In the eth syncing mechanism (full sync, fast sync, light sync), it will try to fetch
  some non-existent blocks or headers(to ensure we indeed download all the missing chain).
  In this case, it's possible that the les-server will receive the request for
  non-existent headers. So don't count it as the \"invalid message\" for scheduling
  dropping.

- Copy the announce object in the closure

  Before the les-server pushes the latest headers to all connected clients, it will create
  a closure and queue it in the underlying request scheduler. In some scenarios it's
  problematic. E.g, in private networks, the block can be mined very fast. So before the
  first closure is executed, we may already update the latest_announce object. So actually
  the \"announce\" object we want to send is replaced.

  The downsize is the client will receive two announces with the same td and then drop the
  server.

P2P Simulation Framework

- Don't double register the protocol services in p2p-simulation \"Start\".

  The protocols upon the devp2p are registered in the \"New node stage\". So don't reigster
  them again when starting a node in the p2p simulation framework

- Add one more new config field \"ExternalSigner\", in order to use clef service in the
  framework.

* common: remove ToHex and ToHexArray (#21610)

ToHex was deprecated a couple years ago. The last remaining use
was in ToHexArray, which itself only had a single call site.

This just moves ToHexArray near its only remaining call site and
implements it using hexutil.Encode. This changes the default behaviour
of ToHexArray and with it the behaviour of eth_getProof. Previously we
encoded an empty slice as 0, now the empty slice is encoded as 0x.

* core/state/snapshot: fix journal recovery from generating old journal (#21775)

* core/state/snapshot: print warning if failed to resolve journal

* core/state/snapshot: fix snapshot recovery

When we meet the snapshot journal consisted with:
- disk layer generator with new-format
- diff layer journal with old-format

The base layer should be returned without error.
The broken diff layer can be reconstructed later
but we definitely don't want to reconstruct the
huge diff layer.

* core: add tests

* cmd/devp2p, internal/utesting: implement TAP output (#21760)

TAP is a text format for test results. Parsers for it are available in many languages,
making it easy to consume. I want TAP output from our protocol tests because the
Hive wrapper around them needs to know about the test names and their individual
results and logs. It would also be possible to just write this info as JSON, but I don't
want to invent a new format.

This also improves the normal console output for tests (when running without --tap).
It now prints -- RUN lines before any output from the test, and indents the log output
by one space.

* cmd/devp2p/internal/ethtest: add correct chain files and improve test output (#21782)

This PR replaces the old test genesis.json and chain.rlp files in the testdata
directory for the eth protocol test suite, and also adds documentation for
running the eth test suite locally.

It also improves the test output text and adds more timeouts.

* core/types, rlp: optimize derivesha (#21728)

This PR contains a minor optimization in derivesha, by exposing the RLP
int-encoding and making use of it to write integers directly to a
buffer (an RLP integer is known to never require more than 9 bytes
total). rlp.AppendUint64 might be useful in other places too.

The code assumes, just as before, that the hasher (a trie) will copy the
key internally, which it does when doing keybytesToHex(key).

A lot of times when we hit 'core' errors, example: invalid tx, the information provided is
insufficient. We miss several pieces of information: what account has nonce too high,
and what transaction in that block was offending?

This PR adds that information, using the new type of wrapped errors.
It also adds a testcase which (partly) verifies the output from the errors.

The first commit changes all usage of direct equality-checks on core errors, into
using errors.Is. The second commit adds contextual information. This wraps most
of the core errors with more information, and also wraps it one more time in
stateprocessor, to further provide tx index and tx hash, if such a tx is encoutered in
a block. The third commit uses the chainmaker to try to generate chains with such
errors in them, thus triggering the errors and checking that the generated string meets
expectations.

This commit enables users to specify which signer they want to use while creating their transactOpts.
Previously all contract interactions used the homestead signer. Now a user can specify whether they

Closes #16484

* common: improve printing of Hash and Address (#21834)

Both Hash and Address have a String method, which returns the value as
hex with 0x prefix. They also had a Format method which tried to print
the value using printf of []byte. The way Format worked was at odds with
String though, leading to a situation where fmt.Sprintf(\"%v\", hash)
returned the decimal notation and hash.String() returned a hex string.

This commit makes it consistent again. Both types now support the %v,
%s, %q format verbs for 0x-prefixed hex output. %x, %X creates
unprefixed hex output. %d is also supported and returns the decimal
notation \"[1 2 3...]\".

For Address, the case of hex characters in %v, %s, %q output is
determined using the EIP-55 checksum. Using %x, %X with Address
disables checksumming.

* p2p/enode: avoid crashing for invalid IP (#21981)

The database panicked for invalid IPs. This is usually no problem
because all code paths leading to node DB access verify the IP, but it's
dangerous because improper validation can turn this panic into a DoS
vulnerability. The quick fix here is to just turn database accesses
using invalid IP into a noop. This isn't great, but I'm planning to
remove the node DB for discv5 long-term, so it should be fine to have
this quick fix for half a year.

* metrics: zero temp variable in  updateMeter

Previously the temp variable was not updated properly after summing it to count.
This meant we had astronomically high metrics, now we zero out the temp whenever we
sum it onto the snapshot count

Moves the temp variable in MeterSnapshot to be 64-bit aligned because of the atomic bug.
Adds a unit test, that catches the previous bug.

* p2p/discover: avoid dropping unverified nodes when table is almost empty (#21396)

This change improves discovery behavior in small networks. Very small
networks would often fail to bootstrap because all member nodes were
dropping table content due to findnode failure. The check is now changed
to avoid dropping nodes on findnode failure when their bucket is almost
empty. It also relaxes the liveness check requirement for FINDNODE/v4
response nodes, returning unverified nodes as results when there aren't
any verified nodes yet.

The "findnode failed" log now reports whether the node was dropped
instead of the number of results. The value of the "results" was
always zero by definition.

"Downloader queue stats" information is now provided once every minute instead of once every 10 seconds.

* go.mod : update goja dependency (#21432)

* eth/downloader: change intial download size (#21366)

This changes how the downloader works, a little bit. Previously, when block sync started,
we immediately started filling up to 8192 blocks. Usually this is fine, blocks are small
in the early numbers. The threshold then is lowered as we measure the size of the blocks
that are filled.

However, if the node is shut down and restarts syncing while we're in a heavy segment,
that might be bad. This PR introduces a more conservative initial threshold of 2K blocks
instead.

* miner: use channels instead of atomics in update loop (#21536)

This PR changes several different things:

- Adds test cases for the miner loop
- Stops the worker if it wasn't already stopped in worker.Close()
- Uses channels instead of atomics in the miner.update() loop

Co-authored-by: Felix Lange <fjl@twurst.com>

* miner: fix regression, add test for starting while download (#21547)

Fixes a regression introduced in #21536

* p2p/discover: fix typo in comments (#21554)

* Dockerfile: unexpose port 8547 as GraphQL was merged into HTTP endpoint (#21556)

* p2p/nodestate: ensure correct callback order (#21436)

This PR adds an extra guarantee to NodeStateMachine: it ensures that all
immediate effects of a certain change are processed before any subsequent
effects of any of the immediate effects on the same node. In the original
version, if a cascaded change caused a subscription callback to be called
multiple times for the same node then these calls might have happened in a
wrong chronological order.

For example:

- a subscription to flag0 changes flag1 and flag2
- a subscription to flag1 changes flag3
- a subscription to flag1, flag2 and flag3 was called in the following order:

   [flag1] -> [flag1, flag3]
   [] -> [flag1]
   [flag1, flag3] -> [flag1, flag2, flag3]

This happened because the tree of changes was traversed in a "depth-first
order". Now it is traversed in a "breadth-first order"; each node has a
FIFO queue for pending callbacks and each triggered subscription callback
is added to the end of the list. The already existing guarantees are
retained; no SetState or SetField returns until the callback queue of the
node is empty again. Just like before, it is the responsibility of the
state machine design to ensure that infinite state loops are not possible.
Multiple changes affecting the same node can still happen simultaneously;
in this case the changes can be interleaved in the FIFO of the node but the
correct order is still guaranteed.

A new unit test is also added to verify callback order in the above scenario.

When the license was added to the repository, its text was changed (some

tried to claim copyright on the license text.

The correct way to apply GPL to a project is to copy it verbatim.
This change reverts the text of the GPL to the original.

According to the benchmarks, type assertion between the pointer and
interface is extremely fast.

BenchmarkIntmethod-12           1000000000               1.91 ns/op
BenchmarkInterface-12           1000000000               2.13 ns/op
BenchmarkTypeSwitch-12          1000000000               1.81 ns/op
BenchmarkTypeAssertion-12       2000000000               1.78 ns/op

So the overhead for asserting whether the shortnode has "valuenode"
child is super tiny. No necessary to have another field.

* miner: add test describing expectations for downloader/mining events

We expect that once the downloader emits a DoneEvent,
signaling a successful sync, that subsequent StartEvents

This prevents a security vulnerability where forced syncs via
fake high blocks would stall mining operation.

- Break downloader event handling into event

subsequent downloader Start events.

- Use canStop state to handle the one-off
case when a downloader first succeeds.

This makes mining pause/start logic regarding downloader

This change, though ugly, remove the condition while

* les, p2p/simulations/adapters: fix issues found while simulating les  (#21761)

This adds a few tiny fixes for les and the p2p simulation framework:

LES Parts

- Keep the LES-SERVER connection even it's non-synced

  We had this idea to reject the connections in LES protocol if the les-server itself is
  not synced. However, in LES protocol we will also receive the connection from another
  les-server. In this case even the local node is not synced yet, we should keep the tcp
  connection for other protocols(e.g. eth protocol).

- Don't count "invalid message" for non-existing GetBlockHeadersMsg request

  In the eth syncing mechanism (full sync, fast sync, light sync), it will try to fetch
  some non-existent blocks or headers(to ensure we indeed download all the missing chain).
  In this case, it's possible that the les-server will receive the request for
  non-existent headers. So don't count it as the "invalid message" for scheduling
  dropping.

- Copy the announce object in the closure

  Before the les-server pushes the latest headers to all connected clients, it will create
  a closure and queue it in the underlying request scheduler. In some scenarios it's
  problematic. E.g, in private networks, the block can be mined very fast. So before the
  first closure is executed, we may already update the latest_announce object. So actually
  the "announce" object we want to send is replaced.

  The downsize is the client will receive two announces with the same td and then drop the
  server.

P2P Simulation Framework

- Don't double register the protocol services in p2p-simulation "Start".

  The protocols upon the devp2p are registered in the "New node stage". So don't reigster
  them again when starting a node in the p2p simulation framework

- Add one more new config field "ExternalSigner", in order to use clef service in the
  framework.

* common: remove ToHex and ToHexArray (#21610)

ToHex was deprecated a couple years ago. The last remaining use
was in ToHexArray, which itself only had a single call site.

This just moves ToHexArray near its only remaining call site and
implements it using hexutil.Encode. This changes the default behaviour
of ToHexArray and with it the behaviour of eth_getProof. Previously we
encoded an empty slice as 0, now the empty slice is encoded as 0x.

* core/state/snapshot: fix journal recovery from generating old journal (#21775)

* core/state/snapshot: print warning if failed to resolve journal

* core/state/snapshot: fix snapshot recovery

When we meet the snapshot journal consisted with:
- disk layer generator with new-format
- diff layer journal with old-format

The base layer should be returned without error.
The broken diff layer can be reconstructed later
but we definitely don't want to reconstruct the
huge diff layer.

* core: add tests

* cmd/devp2p, internal/utesting: implement TAP output (#21760)

TAP is a text format for test results. Parsers for it are available in many languages,
making it easy to consume. I want TAP output from our protocol tests because the
Hive wrapper around them needs to know about the test names and their individual
results and logs. It would also be possible to just write this info as JSON, but I don't
want to invent a new format.

This also improves the normal console output for tests (when running without --tap).
It now prints -- RUN lines before any output from the test, and indents the log output
by one space.

* cmd/devp2p/internal/ethtest: add correct chain files and improve test output (#21782)

This PR replaces the old test genesis.json and chain.rlp files in the testdata
directory for the eth protocol test suite, and also adds documentation for
running the eth test suite locally.

It also improves the test output text and adds more timeouts.

* core/types, rlp: optimize derivesha (#21728)

This PR contains a minor optimization in derivesha, by exposing the RLP
int-encoding and making use of it to write integers directly to a
buffer (an RLP integer is known to never require more than 9 bytes
total). rlp.AppendUint64 might be useful in other places too.

The code assumes, just as before, that the hasher (a trie) will copy the
key internally, which it does when doing keybytesToHex(key).

- Remove the ws:// prefix from the status endpoint since
  the ws:// is already included in the stack.WSEndpoint().
- Don't register the services again in the node start.
  Registration is already done in the initialization stage.
- Expose admin namespace via websocket.
  This namespace is necessary for connecting the peers via websocket.
- Offer logging relevant options for exec adapter.
  It's really painful to mix all log output in the single console. So
  this PR offers two additional options for exec adapter in this case
  testers can config the log output(e.g. file output) and log level
  for each p2p node.

A lot of times when we hit 'core' errors, example: invalid tx, the information provided is
insufficient. We miss several pieces of information: what account has nonce too high,
and what transaction in that block was offending?

This PR adds that information, using the new type of wrapped errors.
It also adds a testcase which (partly) verifies the output from the errors.

The first commit changes all usage of direct equality-checks on core errors, into
using errors.Is. The second commit adds contextual information. This wraps most
of the core errors with more information, and also wraps it one more time in
stateprocessor, to further provide tx index and tx hash, if such a tx is encoutered in
a block. The third commit uses the chainmaker to try to generate chains with such
errors in them, thus triggering the errors and checking that the generated string meets
expectations.

Co-authored-by: Felix Lange <fjl@twurst.com>

* les: cosmetic rewrite of the arm64 float bug workaround (#21960)

* les: revert arm float bug workaround to check go 1.15

* add traces to reproduce outside travis

* simpler workaround

* crypto/secp256k1: add workaround for go mod vendor (#21735)

Go won't vendor C files if there are no Go files present in the directory.
Workaround is to add dummy Go files.

Fixes: #20232

* accounts/abi/bind: allow specifying signer on transactOpts (#21356)

This commit enables users to specify which signer they want to use while creating their transactOpts.
Previously all contract interactions used the homestead signer. Now a user can specify whether they
want to sign with homestead or EIP155 and specify the chainID which adds another layer of security.

Closes #16484

* common: improve printing of Hash and Address (#21834)

Both Hash and Address have a String method, which returns the value as
hex with 0x prefix. They also had a Format method which tried to print
the value using printf of []byte. The way Format worked was at odds with
String though, leading to a situation where fmt.Sprintf("%v", hash)
returned the decimal notation and hash.String() returned a hex string.

This commit makes it consistent again. Both types now support the %v,
%s, %q format verbs for 0x-prefixed hex output. %x, %X creates
unprefixed hex output. %d is also supported and returns the decimal
notation "[1 2 3...]".

For Address, the case of hex characters in %v, %s, %q output is
determined using the EIP-55 checksum. Using %x, %X with Address
disables checksumming.

* core,les: headerchain import in batches (#21471)

* core: add test for headerchain inserts

* core, light: write headerchains in batches

* core: change to one callback per batch of inserted headers + review concerns

* core: error-check on batch write

* core: unexport writeHeaders

* core: remove callback parameter in InsertHeaderChain

The semantics of InsertHeaderChain are now much simpler: it is now an
all-or-nothing operation. The new WriteStatus return value allows
callers to check for the canonicality of the insertion. This change
simplifies use of HeaderChain in package les, where the callback was
previously used to post chain events.

* core: skip some hashing when writing headers

* core: less hashing in header validation

* core: fix headerchain flaw regarding blacklisted hashes

Co-authored-by: Felix Lange <fjl@twurst.com>

* cmd/geth: add test to verify regexps in version check (#21962)

* crypto/signify, build: fix archive signing with signify (#21977)

This fixes some issues in crypto/signify and makes release signing work.

The archive signing step in ci.go used getenvBase64, which decodes the key data.
This is incorrect here because crypto/signify already base64-decodes the key.

* p2p/enode: avoid crashing for invalid IP (#21981)

The database panicked for invalid IPs. This is usually no problem
because all code paths leading to node DB access verify the IP, but it's
dangerous because improper validation can turn this panic into a DoS
vulnerability. The quick fix here is to just turn database accesses
using invalid IP into a noop. This isn't great, but I'm planning to
remove the node DB for discv5 long-term, so it should be fine to have
this quick fix for half a year.

Fixes #21849

* les, light: remove untrusted header retrieval in ODR (#21907)

* les, light: remove untrusted header retrieval in ODR

* les: polish

* light: check the hash equality in odr

* core, trie: speed up some tests with quadratic processing flaw (#21987)

This commit fixes a flaw in two testcases, and brings down the exec-time from ~40s to ~8s for trie/TestIncompleteSync.

The checkConsistency was performed over and over again on the complete set of nodes, not just the recently added, turning it into a quadratic runtime.

* les: introduce forkID (#21974)

* les: introduce forkID

* les: address comment

* build: upgrade to Go 1.15.6 (#21986)

* params: go-ethereum v1.9.25 stable

* update README.md

* update Makefile

* add mining node as bootnode

[v1.9.25](/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/v1.9.25)

[`e787272`](/ethereum/go-ethereum/commit/e7872729012a4871397307b12cc3f4772ffcbec6)

Geth v1.9.25 is a maintenance release.

Notable changes in this release:

* Geth has a new subcommand, `geth version-check`, which displays known security issues ([#21859](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21859))
* The geth `--ws.origins` flag now supports more expressive origin rules ([#21481](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21481))
* Recording of trie key preimages can now be disabled using the `--cache.preimages` flag ([#21402](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21402))
* The accounts/abi/bind package now offers replay-protected transaction signing ([#21356](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21356))
* The GraphQL API now always returns status code 400 if there is an error processing the query ([#21882](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21882))
* The `devp2p nodeset filter` command can now find snap-enabled nodes ([#21950](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21950))
* The eth protocol test suite has been extended with tests for transaction announcements and malicious announce behavior ([#21857](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21857), [#21792](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21792))
* Support for 'retesteth' has been removed from geth since it is no longer used for tests. Its replacement, the `evm t8n` tool, was released in Geth v1.9.16 ([#21861](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21861))
* We now offer signify/minisign signatures for Geth binary downloads as an alternative to PGP. This is experimental, and not yet advertised on the downloads page ([#21798](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21798))

Bug fixes:

* A crash in LES server handling of the GetProofsV2 message is resolved. See [CVE-2020-26264 advisory](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-r33q-22hv-j29q) for more information ([#21896](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21896))
* The LES server no longer locks up during geth shutdown ([#21927](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21927))
* Clef now correctly derives accounts for Ledger Live devices ([#21757](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21757))
* The faucet now ignores URL query parameters in Facebook post URLs ([#21838](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21838))
* Light client peer discovery now uses DNS ([#21906](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21906))
* `go mod vendor` of go-ethereum should now work ([#21735](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21735))
* The peer connection acceptor doesn't hot-spin anymore when geth runs out of file descriptors ([#21878](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21878))
* Using the `reexec` option for tracing RPC methods no longer crashes the RPC handler ([#21830](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21830))
* `common.Hash` and `common.Address` now print as hex when using `fmt.Println` ([#21834](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21834))
* A rare deadlock in Discovery v5 message dispatch is fixed ([#21858](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21858))
* Failures in internal CPU metrics collection no longer crash geth ([#21864](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21864))
* In Go contract bindings generated by abigen, the `Raw` field of parsed events is now set correctly ([#21807](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21807))
