Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26264:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

- The provided content directly references CVE-2020-26264 and indicates that it's a vulnerability affecting the LES (Light Ethereum Subprotocol) server in go-ethereum. 
- The description mentions a crash caused by a malicious `GetProofsV2` request, which aligns with the official CVE description that mentions a vulnerability related to `GetProofsV2` requests.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from a bug in how the LES server handles `GetProofsV2` requests where the `header` variable can be nil.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A missing check for a nil `header` pointer before using it in the `GetProofsV2` request handling logic leads to a null pointer dereference.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploiting this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, specifically a crash of the LES server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
-  A malicious LES client can send a crafted `GetProofsV2` request that triggers the missing null check.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a connected LES client, meaning they must establish a peer connection with a vulnerable LES server.

**7. Additional Details:**
- The content also includes a patch for the vulnerability within the `les/server_handler.go` file, where code was added to check if the header is valid before using it.
- The content mentions that this vulnerability only affects nodes that have `les` server functionality enabled, and it can be mitigated by either applying the patch or disabling `les`.

In summary, CVE-2020-26264 is a DoS vulnerability in the go-ethereum LES server caused by a missing nil check when processing `GetProofsV2` requests, which is exploitable by a connected malicious LES client leading to a server crash. The provided content accurately describes the vulnerability, its root cause, and provides context for its fix.
