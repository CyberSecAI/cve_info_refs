Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-26163:

**Root Cause:**

*   The BigBlueButton application (specifically the Greenlight interface) was directly reading the Host header from incoming HTTP requests without proper validation. This allowed an attacker to manipulate the header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Host Header Injection:** The application failed to validate the Host header, making it susceptible to Host Header Injection attacks.
*   Lack of input sanitization: The application did not implement a whitelist or any other checks to sanitize the Host header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** An attacker could manipulate the Host header to point to a malicious domain controlled by them. When the victim requests a password reset, the reset link would point to the attacker's server.
*   **Credential Theft:**
    *   The attacker can capture the password reset token from the malicious link. They could then reset the victim's password, potentially locking the victim out of their account.
    *   The attacker could create a fake password reset portal, mimicking the genuine one, and capture the victim's new password. This would allow the attacker to maintain access to the victim's account and potentially use the captured password on other applications used by the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is the 'Forgot Password?' functionality within the Greenlight interface.
*   The attacker manipulates the Host header in the HTTP request sent to the server when submitting the password reset form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests sent to the BigBlueButton server. This can be achieved through techniques like man-in-the-middle attacks, or by registering a domain name that is similar to the legitimate one.
*   The attacker needs to know the email address of a user of the BigBlueButton system.
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by implementing a `SAFE_HOSTS` environment variable, which acts as a whitelist for allowed host headers. This change was introduced in version 2.5.6 of Greenlight.
*   The vulnerability is more likely to affect self-installed package based software due to the variety of environments they are deployed in.
