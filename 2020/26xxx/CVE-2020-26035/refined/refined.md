- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper quoting when rendering tags in the ticket view. The raw text of the tags is added to the DOM without sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can store malicious code within a ticket's tags. This code will be executed when an agent views the ticket, potentially leading to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, data theft, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the agent.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can inject malicious code via the tags functionality in the ticket creation/editing process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create or modify tickets to add malicious tags.
