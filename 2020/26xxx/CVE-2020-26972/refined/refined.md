{
  "cveId": "CVE-2020-26972",
  "description": "The lifecycle of IPC Actors allows managed actors to outlive their manager actors; and the former must ensure that they are not attempting to use a dead actor they have a reference to. Such a check was omitted in WebGL, resulting in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The `RaiiShmem` object was created with a pointer to an `IProtocol` actor that could become invalid if the manager actor was freed before the managed actor, leading to a use-after-free.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free",
       "Incorrect lifecycle management of IPC actors"
    ],
    "impact": "A use-after-free vulnerability that could lead to a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Manipulating the lifecycle of WebGL and IPC actors to trigger the use-after-free condition."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to cause the top-level protocol to be destroyed while the application is still manipulating shared memory. This could potentially involve enqueueing specific commands or manipulating timing."
