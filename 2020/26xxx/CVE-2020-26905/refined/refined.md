**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an admin credential disclosure vulnerability found in specific NETGEAR WiFi systems. The advisory does not go into technical specifics of the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerability lies in the possibility of disclosing admin credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access and control of the affected devices due to the exposure of administrative credentials. This can lead to a compromise of the network.

**Attack vectors:**
The advisory states that the attack vector is adjacent to the device (AV:A). This means the attacker would need to be in the same network as the targeted devices. The advisory doesn't specify if the vulnerability is present on the web management interface or any other management service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be positioned on the same network as the vulnerable device to exploit the vulnerability. No special authentication (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N) is required.

**Affected Products:**
The vulnerability affects these NETGEAR models:
* CBR40
* RBK752
* RBR750
* RBS750
* RBK852
