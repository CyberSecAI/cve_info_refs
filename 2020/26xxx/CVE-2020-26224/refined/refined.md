Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26224:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `submitReorder` function within the `OrderController.php` file not verifying if a user is logged in before allowing them to reorder. This lack of access control allows unauthenticated users to potentially view order details.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper access control checks before executing the reorder functionality. This allows unauthorized access to order information.
- **Lack of Authentication Check:** The code was missing a check to ensure that the user was logged in before attempting to reorder, which is a critical security flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could enumerate all orders placed on the website, potentially gaining access to sensitive customer data such as order details, shipping addresses, and purchased products. The provided CVSS vector shows high confidentiality impact.
- **Data Manipulation:** Though primarily an information disclosure issue, the "I:L" (Low Integrity) impact in the CVSS vector suggests that under specific circumstances, the attacker might be able to slightly modify or influence the reorder process or resulting cart.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access (AV:N):** The attack can be performed remotely over the network, requiring no special access.
- **Low Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is easy to execute, requiring minimal effort or specialized knowledge from the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access (PR:N):** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction (UI:N):** The attacker doesn't need any interaction with the victim user to exploit the flaw.
- The attacker must be able to send a request with the 'submitReorder' parameter and an 'id_order' to the vulnerable endpoint

**Additional Details:**
- The commit `709d9afab7bdba1de5d7225a40e4f28c35975909` specifically addresses this vulnerability. It adds a check `&& $this->context->customer->isLogged()` to ensure the user is logged in before proceeding with the reorder.
- The vulnerability was identified and reported by hachh and timactive.
- The affected versions are all versions >= 1.4.10.0 and is fixed in version 1.7.6.9

The vulnerability is classified as CWE-284: Improper Access Control and is assigned a severity of "High".
