Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26284:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Go's `os/exec.LookPath` function operates on Windows. When searching for an executable, `LookPath` prioritizes the current working directory (`.`) before searching the directories specified in the `PATH` environment variable. This behavior is different from the standard Windows `CreateProcess` API and can lead to unexpected execution of binaries located in the current directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Path Traversal/Unintended Execution:** The primary weakness is that an attacker can place a malicious executable (e.g., `exe` or `bat` file) with the same name as a legitimate system utility in the current working directory. When a Go program uses `exec.Command` to execute that utility (without specifying a full path), `LookPath` will locate and execute the malicious file instead of the intended system utility.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. This could allow the attacker to compromise the system, steal sensitive data, or perform other malicious activities.
-   **Impact is Moderate:** as the user must be running `hugo` inside an untrusted Hugo site for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Hugo Sites:** The primary attack vector involves a user running the `hugo` command within a directory containing a malicious Hugo site, where the site includes a crafted malicious executable with the same name as a system utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **File System Write Access:** The attacker must have the ability to write files to the current working directory of the user running the Go program. This usually implies control of the files within a specific directory.
-  **User interaction:** The user must run `hugo` within the directory the attacker has control over, in order for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was originally reported in [golang/go#38736](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38736)
*   The fix was implemented in Hugo v0.79.1.
*   The `NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath` workaround that was mentioned is a Microsoft workaround to disable this behavior in cmd.exe, but was not implemented by Go.
