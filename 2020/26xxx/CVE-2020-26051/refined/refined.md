Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**CVE ID:** The content does not reference CVE-2020-26051. The provided exploit is listed as having "CVE: N/A".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `index.php` page. Specifically, the `unametxt` and `pwdtxt` POST parameters are directly used in an SQL query without any filtering.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the insecure handling of user input in the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting SQL code (e.g., `' or 1=1 --`), an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the system. This is because the injected code makes the SQL query always return true, effectively logging the attacker in regardless of their actual credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a web request to the `index.php` page.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious POST request to the vulnerable page with the SQL injection payload in the `unametxt` and/or `pwdtxt` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to access the web application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `index.php` page of the application.
