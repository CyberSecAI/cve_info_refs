Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Synapse's improper handling of invalid JSON data within Matrix events. When Synapse receives an event containing malformed JSON, it relays this data to connected clients.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** Synapse doesn't adequately validate the JSON data within incoming events. This lack of validation allows invalid JSON to be processed and passed on to clients.
- **Denial of Service:** By sending a crafted event with invalid JSON, an attacker can cause connected clients to crash or hang.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Client Crashes or Hangs:** Clients receiving the invalid JSON data can become unresponsive or terminate unexpectedly, disrupting their operation.
- **Long-Lasting Impact:** If the malicious event becomes part of the room state, the issue becomes persistent, affecting clients every time they receive room state data until the event is redacted

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Sending Malicious Events:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Matrix event containing invalid JSON to the Synapse server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send Events:** The attacker must have the capability to send events to a Synapse server. This likely implies that they are either a registered user on the server or have found a way to send messages anonymously.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Synapse version 1.20.0 and later by applying patches [#8106](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8106) and [#8291](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8291). Additional checks were included in [#7372](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/7372) and [#8124](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8124).
- Redacting the malicious event is recommended to resolve the issue for clients that are affected by the invalid event that is already part of the room state.
