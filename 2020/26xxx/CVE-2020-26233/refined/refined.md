  "CVE-2020-26233": {
    "description": "When recursively cloning a Git repository on Windows with submodules, Git will first clone the top-level repository and then recursively clone all submodules by starting new Git processes from the top-level working directory. If a malicious `git.exe` executable is present in the top-level repository then this binary will be started by Git Credential Manager Core when attempting to read configuration, and not `git.exe` as found on the `%PATH%`.",
    "root_cause": "The Git Credential Manager (GCM) on Windows uses `where.exe` to locate the `git.exe` executable. `where.exe` searches the current directory before the system PATH, which allows a malicious `git.exe` in the cloned repository to be executed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The usage of `where.exe` which searches the current directory first, leading to potential execution of malicious executables.",
      "Lack of proper validation for the location of `git.exe` executable used by GCM."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution by having a malicious `git.exe` in a repository, which is executed when the repository is cloned recursively with submodules on Windows.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Cloning a repository with submodules recursively (`git clone --recurse-submodules`).",
      "Placing a malicious `git.exe` in the top level of the repository."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to create or modify a Git repository.",
       "Ability to host the repository that a user clones."
