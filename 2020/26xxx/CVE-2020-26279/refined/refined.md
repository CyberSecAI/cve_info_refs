Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26279:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content directly references CVE-2020-26279. The GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA-27pv-q55r-222g) explicitly mentions this CVE ID.
   -  The advisory states that it affects `ipfs/go-ipfs` and `whyrusleeping/tar-utils`. The provided files correspond to these projects.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is a path traversal issue.
   - It occurs when handling DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) containing relative paths.
   - During retrieval of these DAGs (specifically using `ipfs get`), relative paths like `..` were not correctly handled.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of file paths extracted from DAGs. This allows an attacker to specify paths outside the intended target directory.
   -  The vulnerable code is located in `whyrusleeping/tar-utils` and used by `ipfs/go-ipfs`. The `extractor.go` file in `tar-utils` is modified to prevent traversal.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **File Overwrite:** An attacker could overwrite existing files on the system where the `ipfs get` command is executed.
    - **Arbitrary File Writes:** Attackers could potentially write files to arbitrary locations within the filesystem, beyond the intended output directory. This is possible because of the lack of sanitization, and is confirmed by the fix in `extractor.go`.
    - The advisory also mentions "writing to incorrect output directories," which is a variation of writing to unintended locations.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious DAG:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious DAG that contains relative path elements within its file structure.
   - **`ipfs get` Command:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user executes the `ipfs get` command on this malicious DAG.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **DAG Creation:** Attackers need the ability to create and publish malicious DAGs on the IPFS network.
   - **Victim Interaction:** They need to induce a victim to use the `ipfs get` command to retrieve the malicious DAG.

**7. Patch Information:**
   - The vulnerability was patched in `whyrusleeping/tar-utils` with commit `20a61371de5b51380bbdb0c7935b30b0625ac227`. The `extractor.go` file within this repo was modified to address the traversal.
   - The patch was then applied to `ipfs/kubo` with commit `b7ddba7fe47dee5b1760b8ffe897908417e577b2`.
   - The advisory indicates that `v0.8.0-rc1` and later versions of `go-ipfs` are patched.
   - The fix involved adding a check for ".." in the tar path during the extraction process to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.

**8. Additional Information:**
    - The gateway is not affected, the issue only occurs with the `ipfs get` command.
    - The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate".
    - The advisory credits `tintinweb` as the analyst for finding the issue.

In summary, CVE-2020-26279 is a path traversal vulnerability in the `ipfs/go-ipfs` implementation, stemming from improper handling of relative paths in DAGs during retrieval with the `ipfs get` command. This could enable an attacker to overwrite or create files in unintended locations. The vulnerability was fixed by sanitizing the paths in the `tar-utils` library and applying the fix to `ipfs/go-ipfs`.
