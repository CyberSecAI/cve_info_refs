Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26268:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `MemmappedTensorAllocator` within TensorFlow's `ImmutableConstantOp`. This allocator is used to handle constant tensors created from memory-mapped files. The core issue is that the allocator was not correctly marked as returning an opaque handle for complex data types such as strings, resources and variables. This resulted in TensorFlow attempting to initialize these types by writing to the immutable memory region using placement new, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Write to Immutable Memory:** The primary weakness was the attempt to write to an immutable, memory-mapped region which should have been treated as read-only.
*   **Incorrect Allocator Handling:** The `MemmappedTensorAllocator` did not signal that it returned an opaque handle, causing TensorFlow to invoke placement new to initialize complex data types.
*   **Lack of Opaque Handle Flag:**  The `AllocatesOpaqueHandle()` method in the allocator class was not overridden to return `true` prior to the patch, causing the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Segmentation Fault/Crash:** Attempting to create an immutable constant tensor of a complex type, like a string, from a memory-mapped file using `tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst` would cause a segmentation fault and crash the Python interpreter.
*   **Denial of Service:** While not a remote exploit, it could be used to cause denial of service on a server running a tensorflow model, by crafting an input containing `tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst` with appropriate parameters.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Invocation of `tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst`:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a TensorFlow program or model using the `tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst` operation with a complex data type (string) and providing a memory mapped region.
*   **Model Input:** An attacker could craft malicious inputs for models that include `tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst` operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Construct a TensorFlow graph/model:** The attacker needs to be able to use the TensorFlow API to construct a model that contains a `tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst` operation.
*   **Access to a system running TensorFlow:** The vulnerability is triggered when the crafted TensorFlow program or model is executed.
*   **Ability to create a memory mapped file:** The attacker can specify the path to a memory mapped region as a parameter to the `ImmutableConst` operation.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was found by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
*   The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.4.0, and has been patched in 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0
*   The fix involves overriding the `AllocatesOpaqueHandle()` method in the `MemmappedTensorAllocator` class to return `true`, ensuring that TensorFlow does not attempt to write to the immutable memory.
