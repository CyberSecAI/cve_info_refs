The provided document describes a security advisory for a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting several NETGEAR router and WiFi system models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The document indicates that the vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. However, the exact root cause within the firmware is not specified.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface of the affected devices. These scripts are then stored and executed when other users access the vulnerable page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts that could be executed within the browser of a user who accesses the affected page.
- This can lead to various impacts such as:
  - Stealing of session cookies or other sensitive information
  - Defacement of the web interface
  - Redirection to malicious websites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the affected devices. An attacker needs to inject the malicious script through a vulnerable input field. The injected script is stored in the device and executed whenever a user visits the vulnerable page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need some level of access to the device's configuration settings to inject the malicious script. The specific privilege level required is not specified in the document.
- It is mentioned that the CVSS score requires "High" privileges (PR:H) which indicates that an attacker would need administrative access or similar.

**Affected Products:**
The following NETGEAR product models are affected:
*   D7800
*   R7500v2
*   R7800
*   R8900
*   R9000
*   RAX120
*   RBK50
*   RBR50
*   RBS50
*   XR500
*   XR700

**Mitigation:**
The document states that NETGEAR has released firmware fixes for the vulnerability and recommends users download and install the latest firmware.
The advisory mentions that the vulnerability remains if the user does not complete the recommended steps.
The fixed firmware versions are explicitly listed for each affected product.

**CVSS v3 Rating:**
The advisory includes a CVSS v3 rating:
- Score: 6 (Medium)
- Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
This indicates the attack can be performed locally (AV:L), has low complexity (AC:L), requires high privileges (PR:H), does not require user interaction (UI:N), scope is unchanged (S:U), high confidentiality impact (C:H), high integrity impact (I:H) and no availability impact (A:N).

The advisory is associated with the identifier PSV-2018-0554. There is no mention of an associated CVE ID.
