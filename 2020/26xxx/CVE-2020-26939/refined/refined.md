Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2020-26939:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) decoder in Bouncy Castle handles invalid ciphertexts that decrypt to a short payload. Specifically, an early exception is thrown when the decrypted payload is too short.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- **CWE-203: Observable Differences in Behavior to Error Inputs:** The vulnerability is a timing side-channel, where the timing of the exception leaks information about the private key used for decryption. An attacker could potentially distinguish between successful decryptions and failed decryptions due to short payloads based on the time it takes to process the input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** By observing the timing differences, an attacker could potentially learn information about the private exponent of the RSA private key used for encryption. This could potentially lead to further attacks that compromise the confidentiality of encrypted data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack involves sending specially crafted invalid ciphertexts to the RSA decryption function using the OAEP padding scheme.
- By timing the response of the function, an attacker can infer information from the early exceptions that are thrown when a short payload is decrypted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send encrypted data to be decrypted by the vulnerable system.
- They also need to be able to observe the timing of the response from the decryption operation.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided commit link (`https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/commit/930f8b274c4f1f3a46e68b5441f1e7fadb57e8c1`) shows the fix implemented which introduces an initial raw RSA decryption calculation solely to perform a length check on the payload before proceeding with the actual decryption process.
- The vulnerability was present in BC-FJA versions 1.0.0, 1.0.1, BC 1.60 or earlier.
- The vulnerability was fixed in BC-FJA version 1.0.1.2, 1.0.2 and later and BC 1.61 or later.
- The workaround suggested involves first performing a raw RSA decryption to determine the length of the payload, and only proceeding with the actual decryption if the length is as expected, otherwise, return failure. This way, the vulnerability is mitigated by eliminating the observable differences in behavior for various invalid ciphertexts.
- The correct payload size should be equal to the ceiling of bitLength/8 octets, where bitLength is the size of the RSA modulus in bits.
