Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `MCallGetProperty` opcode within the JavaScript engine's JIT compiler (IonMonkey). The compiler incorrectly assumes that this opcode is idempotent (doesn't have side effects) when, in certain scenarios, it can trigger a write side effect by calling the `func_resolve` function. This function can reallocate memory for the prototype chain, potentially causing the old address to be used by JIT code after the reallocation leading to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Idempotency Assumption:** The `MCallGetProperty` opcode is marked as idempotent when it can perform a write operation to grow the slots buffer.
*   **Use-After-Free:** When memory is reallocated by `func_resolve` and JIT code uses the old address, this leads to a use-after-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The use-after-free vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in the content process. This is considered a critical impact as it gives attackers control over the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious JavaScript:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious JavaScript code that triggers the faulty `MCallGetProperty` opcode with unmet assumptions. The provided proof of concept (POC) HTML file and JS shell test cases demonstrate how to trigger this behavior.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Deliver Malicious JavaScript:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver malicious JavaScript to a vulnerable browser. This could be through a malicious website, an ad network, or other means of injecting malicious code into a web page.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by 360政企安全漏洞研究院 in the Tianfu Cup 2020 International Cybersecurity Contest.
*   The vulnerability affects Firefox, Firefox ESR, and Thunderbird.
*   The fix involves removing the rare case where the MCallGetProperty opcode is used with the idempotent flag and adding a mitigation to use the BaselineJIT (less optimized but more predictable) instead of IonMonkey in the rare case.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 82.0.3, Firefox ESR 78.4.1, and Thunderbird 78.4.2.
*   The vulnerability was present in older versions and required backports for affected branches
*   Warp, a new JIT engine, was motivated by this sort of problem and shipped to release in Firefox 83.
