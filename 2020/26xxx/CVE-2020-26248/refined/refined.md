The provided content relates to CVE-2020-26248.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection, caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input (IDs) within SQL queries. Specifically, the `id_product` parameter was not being cast to an integer before being used in queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize and validate user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can use the SQL injection to retrieve sensitive data from the database or potentially disrupt the MySQL service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the application's front-end controllers, specifically `CommentGrade.php`, `ListComments.php`, and potentially other parts where product IDs are used in SQL queries. The attacker can manipulate the `id_product` parameter in the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need authentication or special privileges. They need to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
