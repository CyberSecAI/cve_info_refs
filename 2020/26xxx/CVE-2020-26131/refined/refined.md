Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-26131:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insecure folder permissions on the default installation directory of Open DHCP Server. Specifically, the directories `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\OpenDHCPServer\` (for the Regular version) and `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\OpenDHCPLdap\` (for the LDAP Based version) allow any user within the "Authenticated Users" group to modify their contents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File System Permissions (CWE-269):** The core issue is the overly permissive access control settings on the installation directory. The "Authenticated Users" group has write access, allowing modification of critical executable files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation to SYSTEM:** By replacing the legitimate executable `OpenDHCPServer.exe` or `OpenDHCPLdap.exe` with a malicious binary, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges when the service restarts. This allows for complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack requires local access to the target system.
- **File Replacement:** The attacker needs to replace the original executable of the DHCP server with a crafted one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable Open DHCP Server is installed.
- **Authenticated User Status:** The attacker needs to be part of the "Authenticated Users" group, which is a standard user permission on Windows systems.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to write files to the installation directory.

**Additional Details:**

- The advisory explicitly mentions the lack of vendor response to the vulnerability report.
- A workaround is provided, suggesting changing the installation directory to `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Program Files\` or `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Program Files(x86)\`, which have more restrictive default permissions.
