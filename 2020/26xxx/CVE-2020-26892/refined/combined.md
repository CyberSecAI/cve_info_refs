Subject: [CVE-2020-26521][CVE-2020-26892] NATS JWT vulnerabilities

Folks,

The NATS project has a new advisories website:
  <<https://advisories.nats.io/>>

We also have two new CVEs; both relate to our JWT handling and both
affect the NATS server:

* CVE-2020-26521
  + Nil deref in JWT library, causing Go panic
  + NATS server upgrade required to avoid Denial-of-Service
  + 2020-11-02
* CVE-2020-26892
  + Incorrect credential expiration handling via JWT library
  + API fixes needed by library users
  + NATS server upgrade required for expiration to work
  + 2020-11-02

The text of our advisories should be attached.

We have just released NATS server 2.1.9 which includes the fixes for
both these issues.

Regards,
-Phil Pennock

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
