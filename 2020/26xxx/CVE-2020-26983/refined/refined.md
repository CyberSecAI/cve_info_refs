Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-26983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PDF files within Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds Write:** The insufficient validation allows for a write operation that exceeds the boundaries of an allocated data structure. This is classified as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious PDF File:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted, malicious PDF file using the affected software (JT2Go or Teamcenter Visualization).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, specifically that the target user must open the malicious PDF file.
- **Local Access:** Although the attack can be triggered by opening a file, the CVSS vector AV:L indicates that this can occur when the malicious file is available to the user (local).
- **No Privileges Required:** The CVSS vector PR:N indicates no user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, only that a user opens the file.
