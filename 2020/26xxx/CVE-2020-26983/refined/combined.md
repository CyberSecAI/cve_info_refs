# Advisory Details

January 14th, 2021
## Siemens JT2Go PDF File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-054ZDI-CAN-11900

| CVE ID | [CVE-2020-26983](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-26983) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Siemens |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [JT2Go](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/plm-components/jt2go.html) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Siemens JT2Go. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |

SSA-622830: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in JT2Go and
Teamcenter Visualization before V13.1.0

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2021-01-12
2021-05-17
V1.2

SUMMARY

Siemens has released version V13.1.0 for JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization to ﬁx multiple vulnerabili-
ties that could be triggered when the products read ﬁles in different ﬁle formats (JT, XML, CG4, CGM,
PDF, RGB, SGI, TGA, PAR, PCX). If a user is tricked to opening of a malicious ﬁle with the affected
products, this could lead to application crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution or data extraction on
the target host system.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest versions and to limit opening of untrusted ﬁles from
unknown sources in the affected products. Please refer to SSA-663999 [0] and SSA-695540 [1] for further
information regarding later version updates.

Note: Previous versions of this advisory also contained the vulnerabilities CVE-2020-26989, CVE-
2020-26990, and CVE-2020-28383 (now addressed in [0]) and CVE-2020-26991 (now addressed in
[1]).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

JT2Go is a 3D JT viewing tool to allow users to view JT, PDF, Solid Edge, PLM XML with available JT,
VFZ, CGM, and TIF data.

Teamcenter Visualization software enables enterprises to enhance their product lifecycle management
(PLM) environment with a comprehensive family of visualization solutions. The software enables enter-
prise users to access documents, 2D drawings and 3D models in a single environment.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-26980

Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing JT ﬁles. A crafted JT
ﬁle could trigger a type confusion condition. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute
code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-11881)

Confusion’)

Vulnerability CVE-2020-26981

When opening a specially crafted xml ﬁle, the application could disclose arbitrary ﬁles to remote
attackers. This is because of the passing of specially crafted content to the underlying XML parser
without taking proper restrictions such as prohibiting an external dtd. (ZDI-CAN-11890)
