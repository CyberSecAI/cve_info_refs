- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Plain-text password storage. User credentials, including the Unisphere admin privilege user password, are stored in plain text within multiple log files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Plain-text storage of sensitive user credentials, including passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker with access to the log files can use the exposed passwords to gain unauthorized access with the privileges of the compromised user, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system and log files is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and have local access to the system and its log files.
