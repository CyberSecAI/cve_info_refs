Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2020-26559 is a flaw in the Bluetooth Mesh Profile Specification (versions 1.0 and 1.0.1) provisioning procedure. Specifically, an attacker that is already provisioned can bypass the intended authentication and directly calculate the AuthValue without needing to brute-force it. This is possible due to the way the AuthValue is derived from other values exchanged during the provisioning process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **AuthValue Leak:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the AuthValue, which is intended to be a secret used for authentication during provisioning, can be directly computed from publicly available provisioning data, including the Provisioner's public key, provisioning confirmation value, and provisioning random value, as long as an attacker provides its public key during the provisioning procedure.
*   The vulnerability is present in the Mesh Profile Specification versions 1.0 and 1.0.1.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can directly calculate the AuthValue even without prior knowledge. This allows them to complete the provisioning operation, obtain a NetKey, and thus perform any action a provisioned node is allowed.
*   **Full Network Access:** An attacker obtaining the AuthValue can authenticate to both the Provisioner and provisioned devices within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Over-the-Air:** The vulnerability is exploited by intercepting and manipulating data during the Bluetooth Mesh provisioning procedure.
*   **Public Key exchange:** An attacker needs to exchange public keys with the vulnerable provisioner during a provisioning attempt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker must be within wireless range of a vulnerable Bluetooth Mesh device that is being provisioned.
*  **Provisioned Status:**  The attacker needs to be a provisioned device on the network to be able to execute this attack.
*   **Data Interception:** The attacker needs to acquire the Provisionerâ€™s public key, provisioning confirmation value, and provisioning random value.
*   **Public Key Injection:** The attacker also needs to provide its own public key during the provisioning attempt.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Bluetooth Mesh Profile Specification versions 1.0 and 1.0.1.
*   The Bluetooth SIG recommends using an out-of-band mechanism to exchange public keys during provisioning to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain the NetKey, which provides access to the network layer but not application data decryption unless an AppKey is obtained as well.
