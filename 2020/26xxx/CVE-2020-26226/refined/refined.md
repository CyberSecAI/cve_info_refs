Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26226:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how `semantic-release` masked secrets. The masking mechanism did not account for secrets containing characters that would be URI encoded when included in a URL. Consequently, if a secret contained such characters, it wouldn't be properly masked and could be disclosed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate secret masking: The core issue is the failure to properly mask secrets that undergo URI encoding.
- Regular expression not considering URI encoding: The regular expression used for masking didn't include the URI encoded versions of the secrets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Accidental disclosure of secrets: The primary impact is the potential exposure of sensitive information like tokens, passwords, credentials, and private keys. This could allow unauthorized access or actions depending on the nature of the exposed secrets.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Secrets containing URI-encodable characters: An attacker does not need to directly exploit the system. The vulnerability is triggered if a secret containing characters that become URI encoded is present in the environment and is processed by `semantic-release`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be in a special position. This vulnerability arises when `semantic-release` processes environment variables that contain secrets with URI-encodable characters. An attacker could potentially gain access to secrets that are disclosed due to this vulnerability if those secrets are present in a context where the attacker can observe the output of semantic-release.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 17.2.3 of `semantic-release`.
- The fix involved modifying the regular expression to also match the URI-encoded versions of secrets.
- The vulnerability has a "High" severity rating.
- The commit `ca90b34c4a9333438cc4d69faeb43362bb991e5a` addresses the issue by modifying `lib/hide-sensitive.js` to include URI-encoded versions of secrets in the regular expression used for masking.
