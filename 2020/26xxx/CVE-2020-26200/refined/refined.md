Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26200:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an insufficient authenticity check within a component of the Kaspersky custom boot loader. This component is used in Kaspersky Rescue Disk (KRD) and is trusted by the Authentication Agent of Full Disk Encryption in Kaspersky Endpoint Security (KES). Due to this flaw, the boot loader could load untrusted UEFI modules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Authenticity Check:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of the authenticity of UEFI modules loaded by the custom boot loader. This allows malicious modules to be loaded.
*   **Bypass of UEFI Secure Boot:** The insufficient check allows a bypass of the UEFI Secure Boot feature, which is designed to prevent the loading of unauthorized boot components.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **UEFI Secure Boot Bypass:** An attacker can bypass UEFI Secure Boot. This can allow the attacker to boot a compromised or malicious operating system.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** By loading untrusted UEFI modules, the attacker can gain control early in the boot process, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** An attacker needs physical access to the target computer to exploit this vulnerability. This is a significant requirement as it limits the scope of remote exploitation.
*   **Local Administrator Privileges (Alternative):** If physical access is not available, an attacker with local administrator privileges can also exploit this flaw by modifying the boot loader component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access** to the target computer.
*   **OR**
*   **Local Administrator Privileges** on the target system, which are necessary for modifying the boot loader component if physical access is not available.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Kaspersky Rescue Disk (KRD) and Kaspersky Endpoint Security (KES) with Full Disk Encryption.
*   The fix involves updating the affected products to specific versions, after which it is recommended to install the Microsoft security update [4535680](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4535680/security-update-for-secure-boot-dbx).
