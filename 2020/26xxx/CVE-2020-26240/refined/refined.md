2. EXTRACT
```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An integer overflow in the DAG generation process. Specifically, the index used to calculate the memory offset in the dataset was a 32-bit integer, leading to an overflow when the DAG size exceeded the maximum value of a 32-bit unsigned integer.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow in index calculation for DAG generation. This resulted in incorrect memory offsets during dataset creation.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Miners could generate invalid Proof-of-Work (PoW), leading to invalid blocks. This issue affected mining nodes only, non-mining nodes were unaffected. On the ETC chain, this resulted in erroneous calculations on 2020-11-06.

- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the DAG size exceeds the limit of a 32-bit unsigned integer, which occurs in later epochs of the Ethereum blockchain. This is not triggered by malicious user input, but by the normal progression of the blockchain to larger dataset sizes.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers would need to be miners using affected versions of Geth. The vulnerability is not triggered by external malicious actions but by normal operation of the software.

- **Additional details**:
  - The fix involved changing the index calculations to use 64-bit integers, resolving the overflow issue.
  - The problematic epoch was predicted to occur around January 1st, 2021.
  - The issue was also present on the ETC chain.
  - The fix was implemented in pull request #21793 and released in Geth version 1.9.24
  - The fix was not an accidental one, but intentional to address the issue.
  - The issue was present in the `copy` function where the index multiplied by hashBytes resulted in an overflow when the index was a uint32.
