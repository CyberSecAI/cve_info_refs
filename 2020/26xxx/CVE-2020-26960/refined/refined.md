Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-26960:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `Compact()` method in the `nsTArray` class reallocates memory. When `Compact()` is called, the array could be reallocated without updating other pointers to the array's elements. This could lead to use-after-free scenarios when these outdated pointers are later dereferenced.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. After `Compact()` reallocates the underlying array, any existing pointers that were pointing to the old memory location become dangling. Dereferencing these dangling pointers results in accessing freed memory.
- **Memory Corruption:**  The use-after-free can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:** The primary impact is a crash due to the use-after-free condition.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, the description mentions an "exploitable crash", suggesting that with enough effort, this vulnerability could be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `Compact()` method of `nsTArray`.
- This method is called within the garbage collection process (`JS_GC`).
-  The vulnerability was found by adding a call to `array->Compact()` in the `TestGCPostBarriers.cpp` test file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Code Execution:** The attacker would need to find a way to trigger the `Compact()` method on an `nsTArray` in a context where other parts of the code would have dangling pointers to the array elements after the reallocation.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was triggered in the garbage collection code by adding a call to the `Compact()` method in the `TestGCPostBarriers.cpp` test file after line 58 and before line 64.
- The problematic code is in the `TraceArray` function which accesses the array elements with `&array->ElementAt(i)`. This address becomes invalid after the call to `Compact()`.
- The `nsTArray` class, when compacted, can reallocate its internal buffer, potentially invalidating existing pointers to its elements if not updated.
- The fix involved modifying the code to avoid `realloc` when shrinking the `nsTArray` and similar objects when the `RelocationStrategy::allowRealloc` is false.
- The vulnerability was classified as "sec-moderate", indicating a potentially exploitable issue but with moderate impact.
- The vulnerability was present since the implementation of  [Bug 877762](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=877762)
