{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `FileField` class in Silverstripe CMS does not properly validate file uploads when the field name includes square brackets (`[]`), which are used to submit multiple values in HTML forms. This allows bypassing of file extension restrictions and other validations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Inconsistent handling of array-like form field names",
      "Bypass of extension restrictions",
       "Reliance on form system validation in controller logic"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can upload files with disallowed extensions, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code on the server or other security issues if the uploaded files are mishandled by custom controller logic.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Submitting a file upload form with a `FileField` that uses a name ending in `[]`"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to submit a form on a Silverstripe CMS website with a specially crafted field name.",
    "additional_details": "The issue is specific to the `FileField` class and does not affect the `UploadField` used within the CMS. It is also mentioned that controller logic should not rely on the form system to perform input validation.",
