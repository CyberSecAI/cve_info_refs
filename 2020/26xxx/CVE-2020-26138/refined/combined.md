# Release process[#](#release-process)

This page describes the process followed for "core" releases
(the modules included by [silverstripe/recipe-core](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-core)
and [silverstripe/recipe-cms](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-cms)).

## Release planning[#](#release-planning)

The Silverstripe CMS core team uses an Agile methodology. We aim to keep the latest development branches of each
module in a "potentially releasable" state. Releases are planned around an issue backlog according to our
[roadmap](https://www.silverstripe.org/software/roadmap/). We re-revaluate our priorities every few weeks.

Silverstripe CMS is split up into many modules listed on [`github.com/silverstripe`](https://github.com/silverstripe).
Each may have a different release line (e.g. 2.x vs. 5.x).
There are high-level "recipe" milestones on the [framework repository](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/milestones)
to combine individual module milestones into a larger release that's eventually available to install with
[composer](https://silverstripe.org/download).

New features and API changes are discussed as
[GitHub issues](/en/5/contributing/issues_and_bugs/)),
as well as the [forum](https://forum.silverstripe.org).
They are prioritised by the core team as tickets on
GitHub. In addition, we collect community feedback as [feature ideas](https://forum.silverstripe.org/c/feature-ideas) on the forum.
Any feature ideas we're planning to implement will be flagged there.

## Keeping track[#](#keeping-track)

Release dates are usually not published prior to the release, but you can get a good idea of the release status by
reviewing the release milestone on GitHub. Releases will be
announced on the ["releases" forum category](https://forum.silverstripe.org/c/releases).
Significant releases will also be published via the [`silverstripe.org` blog](https://silverstripe.org/blog).

You can also keep track of new releases through the CMS UI
by installing the [maintenance module](https://github.com/bringyourownideas/silverstripe-maintenance),
or using the [composer outdated](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#outdated) command in your project.

Additionally, you can [keep track of issues](/en/5/contributing/issues_and_bugs#identifying-issues/) (both open and closed)
across all modules involved in a recipe release.

## Release numbering[#](#release-numbering)

Silverstripe CMS follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

All Silverstripe CMS modules (including `silverstripe/framework`) may have patch releases created at any time, and will
not necessarily match other core module patch release numbers. For example, your project may be using
`silverstripe/cms` 5.3.1 with `silverstripe/versioned` 5.3.9.

All Silverstripe CMS recipes are released in lock step with each other. For example, `silverstripe/installer` 5.3.1 will
contain `silverstripe/recipe-cms` 5.3.1 and `silverstripe/recipe-core` 5.3.1. These recipes may contain various patch
versions of its modules within the same minor release line (5.3 in this example).

## Regular minor releases[#](#regular-minor-releases)

Regular minor releases are preceded by pre-stable releases to help lay the groundwork for the stable release.

See our [minor release policy](/en/5/project_governance/minor_release_policy/) for details about our release cadence.

### Beta phase[#](#beta-phase)

At the start of the Beta phase:

* new minor branches for core modules are forked from the major branches
* a feature freeze is instituted on the minor branches
* a `beta1` release is tagged for recipes and related modules.

The length of the beta phase period will be communicated at the time it is tagged via the [Silverstripe Forum](https://forum.silverstripe.org/c/releases). While the beta phase lasts additional betas may be released to address critical issues holding back
testers.

#### "Beta release" definition[#](#beta-release-definition)

The purpose of a beta release is to initiate a "Feature Freeze" to stabilise the Silverstripe CMS codebase for an upcoming stable release and showcase
new features. A beta release is likely to contain regressions and new bugs. A beta release is primarily aimed at testers
who want to help identify bugs and regressions.

#### "Feature freeze" definition[#](#feature-freeze-definition)

A "Feature freeze" is a pre-release minor branch state. This state allows the core team to stabilise the upcoming
release and reach production quality.

The following type of changes can be merged in a branch in feature freeze:

* bug fixes, regardless of severity
* API changes if they fix a bug and are compliant with our existing semver commitments
* merge-ups from older minor branches (introducing bug fixes).

The following changes cannot be merged in a branch in feature freeze:

* anything that introduces new features
* API changes not targeted to fixing a bug, or that alter an existing API in a stable release.

### Release candidate phase[#](#release-candidate-phase)

All critical or high priority issues in the beta release should have been identified and fixed by the start of the
Release Candidate phase.

At the start of the Release Candidate phase:

* a publicly visible `rc1` release is tagged for recipes and related modules
* a private Release Candidate is created containing fixes for undisclosed vulnerabilities on top of the `rc1` release
* the private Release Candidate is delivered to independent auditors for a security review.

The Release Candidate phase lasts approximately two weeks. Additional patches may be added to the final release only if:

* vulnerabilities are discovered by the security audit
* additional critical issues are identified.

#### "Release Candidate" definition[#](#release-candidate-definition)

A release candidate will not introduce any new features compared to its preceding beta release. The Silverstripe CMS
core team is confident a release candidate is production quality and does not introduce new regressions.

The purpose of a release candidate is to allow module maintainers and project owners to audit the upcoming release and
confidently plan their upgrades.

Only critical bug fixes can be added to the upcoming stable release once the release candidate is released.

### Stable phase[#](#stable-phase)

A new stable minor release is tagged for Silverstripe CMS core recipes. This marks the start of our official semver
commitment for any new APIs introduced in that minor release.

## Supported versions[#](#supported-versions)

At any point in time, the core development team will support a set of releases to varying levels. The current support status is outlined on the [roadmap](https://silverstripe.org/roadmap).

See the [minor release policy](/en/5/project_governance/minor_release_policy/) and [major release policy](/en/5/project_governance/major_release_policy/) for more information.

## Deprecation[#](#deprecation)

Needs of developers (both on core framework and custom projects) can outgrow the capabilities
of a certain API. Existing APIs might turn out to be hard to understand, maintain, test or stabilise.
In these cases, it is best practice to "refactor" these APIs into something more useful.
The Silverstripe CMS team acknowledges that developers have built a lot of code on top of existing APIs,
so we strive for giving ample warning on any upcoming changes through a "deprecation cycle".

### Deprecating API[#](#deprecating-api)

* Add a `@deprecated` item to the docblock tag, with a `{@link <class>}` item pointing to the new API to use.
* Update the deprecated code to throw a [Deprecation::notice()](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CDev%5CDeprecation::notice()&version=5) error.
* Deprecations should not be committed to patch releases
* Both the docblock and error message should contain the **version** where the functionality is deprecated from.
  So, if you're committing the change to a *4.12* minor release, the target version will be *4.12.0*.
* Deprecations should only be committed to pre-release branches, ideally before they enter the "beta" phase.
  If deprecations are introduced after this point, their target version needs to be increased by one.
* Make sure that the old deprecated function works by calling the new function - don't have duplicated code!
* The commit message should contain an `API` prefix (see ["commit message format"](/en/5/contributing/code#commit-messages/))
* Document the change in the [changelog](/en/5/changelogs) for the next release
* Deprecated APIs can be removed only after developers have had sufficient time to react to the changes. Hence, deprecated APIs should be removed in MAJOR releases only. Between MAJOR releases, leave the code in place with a deprecation warning.
* Exceptions to the deprecation cycle are APIs that have been moved into their own module, and continue to work with the new minor release. These changes can be performed in a single minor release without a deprecation period.

When deprecating a method:

* Add the following docblock `@deprecated 1.2.3 Use anotherMethod() instead`
* Deprecation::notice('1.2.3', 'Use anotherMethod() instead'); to the top of the method

When deprecating a class:

* Add the following docblock `@deprecated 1.2.3 Use AnotherClass instead`
* Add `Deprecation::notice('1.2.3', 'Use AnotherClass instead', Deprecation::SCOPE_CLASS);` to the top of `__construct()`
* Wrap `Deprecation::notice()` with `Deprecation::withNoReplacement()` if there's no replacement for that deprecated class. e.g:

```
namespace App;

/**
 * @deprecated 4.12.0 Will be removed without equivalent functionality
 */
class MyDeprecatedClass extends AnotherClass
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        Deprecation::withNoReplacement(function () {
            Deprecation::notice(
                '4.12.0',
                'Will be removed without equivalent functionality',
                Deprecation::SCOPE_CLASS
            );
        });
        parent::__construct();
    }
}
```

When deprecating config:

* Add the following docblock `@deprecated 1.2.3 Use different_config instead`

When deprecating some behaviour or combination of configuration values:

* Add `Deprecation::notice('1.2.3', 'Using x with y is deprecated. Do [other thing] instead', Deprecation::SCOPE_GLOBAL);`
* It may not be immediately clear where this type of deprecation notice should go. In that case, add it to the `HTTPApplication::warnAboutDeprecatedSetups()` method.
* It may be appropriate to link to some documentation in the message for this type of deprecation notice.

If there is no immediate replacement for deprecated code that is being called, either because the replacement is not available until the next major version, or because there is not a plan for there to be a replacement, the message should be "Will be removed without equivalent functionality to replace it."

### Avoiding deprecated API[#](#avoiding-deprecated-api)

Wherever possible, once some API has been deprecated, we should stop using it. This allows projects to emit deprecation notices and have an accurate list of code that they need to change.

In some cases, we may not yet have a replacement for code that is required for the current major - but that we still have to call and support internally. In these cases, since we can't stop calling the code, wrap the call to the deprecated code in `Deprecation::withNoReplacement()` e.g:

```
use SilverStripe\Dev\Deprecation;

// ...

// The $myVariable variable will get the result of the call to $obj->myDeprecatedMethod()
$myVariable = Deprecation::withNoReplacement(function () {
    return $obj->myDeprecatedMethod();
});
```

For any unit tests using the deprecated method/class/config, add the following the the top of the unit test. This ensures that deprecated code is still supported as usual when `Deprecation` notices are not enabled, though the tests are skipped whenever you are testing to see if deprecated code is still be called.

```
namespace SilverStripe\Test;

use SilverStripe\Dev\Deprecation;
use SilverStripe\Dev\SapphireTest;

class MyTest extends SapphireTest
{
    public function testSomething()
    {
        if (Deprecation::isEnabled()) {
            $this->markTestSkipped('Test calls deprecated code');
        }
        // ...
    }
}
```

Here's an example for replacing `Director::isDev()` with a (theoretical) `Env::is_dev()`:

```
namespace SilverStripe\Control;

use SilverStripe\Dev\Deprecation;
// ...

class Director
{
    // ...

    /**
     * Returns true if your are in development mode
     * @deprecated 4.12.0 Use Env::is_dev() instead.
     */
    public function isDev()
    {
        Deprecation::notice('4.12.0', 'Use Env::is_dev() instead');
        return Env::is_dev();
    }
}
```

This change could be committed to a minor release like *4.12.0*, and remains deprecated in all subsequent minor releases
(e.g. *4.13.0*), until a new major release (e.g. *5.0.0*), at which point it gets removed from the codebase.

### Enabling deprecation notices[#](#enabling-deprecation-notices)

Deprecation notices aren't enabled by default. They can be turned on for dev environments with one of the following methods:

`.env`

```
SS_DEPRECATION_ENABLED=true
```

```
// app/_config.php
use SilverStripe\Dev\Deprecation;

Deprecation::enable();
```

To test that deprecated code is no longer being called, run code via CI in an installer/kitchen-sink project that has deprecations enabled. Then view the CI output in the "Run tests" of the GitHub actions CI job and/or view the contents of `silverstripe.log` in the GitHub actions CI artifact to see if there are deprecation warnings. There should be zero deprecation warnings.

## Security releases[#](#security-releases)

A security release is a [Silverstripe CMS Core Release](/en/5/contributing/making_a_silverstripe_core_release#standard-release-process/) with patches for one or more security issues.

### Reporting an issue[#](#reporting-an-issue)

Report security issues in our [commercially supported modules](/en/5/project_governance/supported_modules/)
to security@silverstripe.org.
Please don't file security issues in our [bugtracker](/en/5/contributing/issues_and_bugs/).

Silverstripe CMS does not operate a *bug bounty* program.

### Acknowledgment and disclosure[#](#acknowledgment-and-disclosure)

In the event of a confirmed vulnerability in our
[supported modules](/en/5/project_governance/supported_modules/),
we will take the following actions:

* Acknowledge to the reporter that we've received the report and that a fix is forthcoming.
  We'll give a rough timeline and ask the reporter to keep the issue confidential until we announce it.
* Assign a [CVE identifier](https://cve.mitre.org) to the issue.
* For "high" and "critical" issues (CVSS of >=7.0): Pre-announce the upcoming security release to a private pre-announcement mailing list of important stakeholders (see below).
* We will inform you about resolution and [announce](https://forum.silverstripe.org/c/releases) a
  [new release](https://www.silverstripe.org/security-releases/) publicly.

You can help us determine the problem and speed up responses by providing us with more information on how to reproduce
the issue:

* Silverstripe CMS version (incl. any installed modules)
* PHP/webserver version and configuration
* anonymised webserver access logs (if a hack is suspected)
* any other services and web packages running on the same server.

### Severity rating[#](#severity-rating)

Each [security release](https://www.silverstripe.org/security-releases/) includes an overall severity rating and one for
each vulnerability. The rating indicates how important an update is.
It follows the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss).
This rating determines which release lines are targeted with security fixes.

| Severity | CVSS | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Critical** | 9.0 to 10.0 | Critical releases require immediate action. Such vulnerabilities allow attackers to take control of your site and you should upgrade on the day of release. *Example: Directory traversal, privilege escalation* |
| **High** | 7.0 to 8.9 | Important releases should be evaluated immediately. These issues allow an attacker to compromise a site's data and should be fixed within days. *Example: SQL injection.* |
| **Medium** | 4.0 to 6.9 | Releases of moderate severity should be applied as soon as possible. They allow the unauthorized editing or creation of content. *Examples: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in template helpers.* |
| **Low** | 0.1 to 3.9 | Low risk releases fix information disclosure and read-only privilege escalation vulnerabilities. These updates should also be applied as soon as possible, but with an impact-dependent priority. *Example: Exposure of the core version number, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) limited to the admin interface.* |
| **None** | 0.0 | These releases won't affect a large majority of projects, and may not require any action. They only impact projects with extremely complex or unlikely customisations. They do not impact projects which only implement common customisations or use common features. |

### Internal security process[#](#internal-security-process)

See [Silverstripe CMS Core Release Process](/en/5/contributing/making_a_silverstripe_core_release/).

### Pre-announcement mailing list[#](#pre-announcement-mailing-list)

In addition to our public disclosure process, we maintain a private mailing list where upcoming
"high" and "critical" security releases are pre-announced.
Members of this list will receive a security pre-announcement, as soon as it has been
sufficiently researched, with a timeline for the upcoming release.
This will happen a few days before the announcement goes public alongside a new release,
and most likely before a patch has been developed.

Since we'll distribute sensitive information on unpatched vulnerabilities in this list,
the selection criteria for joining naturally has to be strict.
Applicants should provide references within the community,
as well as a demonstrated need for this level of information
(e.g. involvement with a large website with sensitive customer data).
You don’t need to be a client of Silverstripe Ltd to get on board,
but we will need to perform some low-touch background checks to verify your identity.
Please contact security@silverstripe.org for details.

Only "high" and "critical" issues are pre-announced via the mailing list. If you want
to know about all the minor security mitigations, keep an eye on the ["releases" forum category](https://forum.silverstripe.org/c/releases),
changelogs and the website section [Security Releases](https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/).

## Quality assurance and testing[#](#quality-assurance-and-testing)

The quality of our software is important to us, and we continuously test it for regressions
through a broad suite of unit and integration tests. These run on
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), and results are publicly available.
Check the badges on the various modules available on [`github.com/silverstripe`](https://github.com/silverstripe).

# CVE-2020-26138 FormField with square brackets in field name skips validation

Severity:
Low ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
Identifier:CVE-2020-26138
Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: ^3.0.0, ^4.0.0
Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: ^4.7.4, ^4.8.0
Release Date:2021-06-08

FileField with array notation skips validation

The FileField class is commonly used for file upload in custom code on a Silverstripe website. This field is designed to be used with a single file upload.

PHP allows for submitting multiple values by adding square brackets to the field name. When this is done to a FileField, it will be coerced into allowing multiple files by using this notation. This is not a supported feature, though nothing is done to prevent this.

In this scenario, validation such as limiting allowed extensions is not applied, and the FileField->saveInto() behaviour is not triggered. If custom controller logic is used to process the file uploads, it might implicitly rely on validation to be provided by the Form system, which is not the case.

Note this issue is for the FileField, not the UploadField which is used within the CMS.

Example:

```
public function MyForm()
{
  $fields = FieldList::create(
    FileField::create('MySafeField')->setAllowedExtensions(['pdf']),
    FileField::create('MyUnsafeField[]')->setAllowedExtensions(['pdf'])
  );
  $actions = FieldList::create(
    FormAction::create('submit')
  );
  $validator = RequiredFields::create('MySafeField', 'MyUnsafeField');
  return Form::create($this, 'Form', $fields, $actions, $validator);
}

public function submit($data, $form)
{
  $data['MyUnsafeField'] // not validated
  $_FILES['MyUnsafeField'] // not validated
}

```

When potential security holes are discovered in SilverStripe's [supported modules](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/project_governance/supported_modules/), we produce security releases to ensure that you are able to promptly secure your SilverStripe websites (check our [security release process](http://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/)). All releases are available on our [download](stable-download/) page, and are [announced](https://forum.silverstripe.org/c/releases) on our forums (register to subscribe). Vulnerabilities in releases are disclosed here. Please subscribe to our security release [RSS feed](software/download/security-releases/rss) and [pre-announcement mailing list](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/contributing/release_process/#pre-announce-mailinglist) to stay updated.

* ### SS-2024-002 Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in error message

  Severity:
  None ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:SS-2024-002
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: <5.3.8
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 5.3.8
  Release Date:2025-01-15

  This vulnerability only affects sites which are in the "dev" environment mode. If your production website is in "dev" mode, it has been misconfigured, and you should immediately swap it to "live" mode.
   See <https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/developer_guides/debugging/environment_types/> for more information.

  If a website has been set to the "dev" environment mode, a URL can be provided which includes an XSS payload which will be executed in the resulting error message.

  **Base CVSS:** [0.0](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2024-53277 XSS in form messages

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2024-53277
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: <5.3.8
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 5.3.8
  Release Date:2025-01-15

  In some cases, form messages can contain HTML markup. This is an intentional feature, allowing links and other relevant HTML markup for the given message.

  Some form messages include content that the user can provide. There are scenarios in the CMS where that content doesn't get correctly sanitised prior to being included in the form message, resulting in an XSS vulnerability.

  **Base CVSS:** [5.4](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2024-47605 XSS via insert media remote file oembed

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2024-47605
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: <5.3.8
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 5.3.8
  Release Date:2025-01-15

  When using the "insert media" functionality, the linked oEmbed JSON includes an HTML attribute which will replace the embed shortcode. The HTML is not sanitized before replacing the shortcode, allowing a script payload to be executed on both the CMS and the front-end of the website.

  See <https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/developer_guides/forms/field_types/htmleditorfield/#sandboxing-oembed-html> for details about configuring embed sandboxing.

* ### SS-2024-001 TinyMCE allows svg files linked in object tags

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:SS-2024-001
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: <5.2.16
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 5.2.16
  Release Date:2024-07-17

  TinyMCE v6 has a configuration value convert\_unsafe\_embeds set to false which allows svg files containing javascript to saved which can be used as a vector for XSS attacks

  After patching the default value of convert\_unsafe\_embeds will be set to true. This means that object tags will be converted to iframes instead the next time the page is saved, which may break any pages that rely upon previously saved object tags. Users are to override this config if desired so that object tags are again used instead of iframes. Note that embed tags are not allowed by default.
  We reviewed the potential impact of this vulnerability within the context of Silverstripe CMS. We concluded this is a medium impact vulnerability given how TinyMCE is used by Silverstripe CMS.

  This vulnerability was described by TinyMCE as follows:

  *A [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content loading and content inserting code. A SVG image could be loaded though an `object` or `embed` element and that image could potentially contain a XSS payload.*

* ### CVE-2024-29885 Reports are still accessible even when canView is set to false

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2024-29885
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/reports: <5.2.3
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/reports: 5.2.3
  Release Date:2024-07-17

  The `Report` class has a `canView` method. If that method is configured to return `false`, the current user should not be able to view the report. While the report list will omit any `canView` `false` reports, those reports can still access them directly assuming the user has the `CMS\_ACCESS\_ReportAdmin` permission.

  After patching the `canView` check will be properly respected

  **Base CVSS**: [4.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:X/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2023-49783 - No permission checks for editing or deleting records with CSV import form

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-49783
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/admin: ^1, ^2
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/admin: 1.13.19, 2.1.8
  Release Date:2024-01-23

  Users who don't have edit or delete permissions for records exposed in a `ModelAdmin` can still edit or delete records using the CSV import form, provided they have create permissions.

  The likelyhood of a user having create permissions but *not* having edit or delete permissions is low, but it *is* possible.

  Note that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the import form disabled via the [`showImportForm` public property](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Admin/ModelAdmin.html#property_showImportForm), nor does it impact the `SecurityAdmin` section.

  #### Action may be required

  If you have a custom implementation of [`BulkLoader`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html), you should update your implementation to respect permissions when the return value of [`getCheckPermissions()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html#method_getCheckPermissions) is true.

  If you are using any `BulkLoader` in your own project logic, or maintain a module which uses it, you should consider passing `true` to [`setCheckPermissions()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html#method_setCheckPermissions) if the data is provided by users.

  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 4.11.39, 5.1.11
  Release Date:2024-01-23

  If a user should not be able to see a record, but that record can be added to a `GridField` using the `GridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter` component, the record's title can be accessed by that user.

  **Base CVSS: [4.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2023-44401 - View permissions are bypassed for paginated lists of ORM data in GraphQL queries

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-44401
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/graphql: ^4, ^5
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/graphql: 4.3.7, 5.1.3
  Release Date:2024-01-23

  `canView` permission checks are bypassed for ORM data in paginated GraphQL query results where the total number of records is greater than the number of records per page.

  Note that this also affects GraphQL queries which have a limit applied, even if the query isn’t paginated per se.

  This has been fixed by ensuring no new records are pulled in from the database after performing `canView` permission checks for each page of results. This may result in some pages in your query results having less than the maximum number of records per page even when there are more pages of results.

  This behaviour is consistent with how pagination works in other areas of Silverstripe CMS, such as in `GridField`, and is a result of having to perform permission checks in PHP rather than in the database directly.

  You can choose to disable these permission checks by disabling the `CanViewPermission` plugin following the instructions in [overriding default plugins](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/graphql/plugins/overview/#overriding-default-plugins).

  Note that this vulnerability does not affect silverstripe/graphql version 3.x.

  **Base CVSS: [5.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2023-40180 - DDOS Vulnerability on GraphQL due to lack of protection against recursive queries

  Severity:
  High ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-40180
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/graphql: ^3.0.0, ^4.0.0, ^5.0.0
  Versions Fixed:3.8.2, 4.1.3, 4.2.5, 4.3.4, 5.0.3
  Release Date:2023-10-16

  An attacker could use a recursive graphql query to execute a Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDOS attack) against a website. This mostly affects websites with publicly exposed graphql schemas.

  If your Silverstripe CMS project does not expose a public facing graphql schema, a user account is required to trigger the DDOS attack. If your site is hosted behind a content delivery network (CDN), such as Imperva or CloudFlare, this may further mitigate the risk.

  The fix includes some new configuration options which you might want to tweak for your project, based on your own requirements. See the documentation in the references for details.

  **Base CVSS: [7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)**

* ### SS-2023-002 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities inherited form TinyMCE

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:SS-2023-002
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/admin: ^1.0.0
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/admin: ^1.13.6
  Release Date:2023-07-31

  TinyMCE 4.x is vulnerable to several XSS vectors, which had been patched in later versions. Two of these have been identified as affecting `silverstripe/admin`.

  Only Silverstripe CMS 4 is affected by these vulnerabilities. It's not possible to upgrade Silverstripe CMS 4 to use a more recent release of TinyMCE without introducing breaking changes. Instead, the security patches that shipped in later releases of TinyMCE have been backported to the TinyMCE version bundled in `silverstripe/admin`.

  Silverstripe CMS 5 is not affected by these vulnerabilities because it uses TinyMCE 6.

  These vulnerabilities were described by TinyMCE:

  > A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the schema validation logic of the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor using the clipboard or editor APIs. This malicious content could then end up in content published outside the editor, if no server-side sanitization was performed. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.8.2 or lower.

* ### CVE-2023-32302 Members with no password can be created and bypass custom login forms

  Severity:
  None ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-32302
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: ^3, ^4, ^5
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 4.13.14, 5.0.13
  Release Date:2023-07-31

  When a new Member record was created in the cms it was possible to set a blank password. If an attacker knows the email address of the user with the blank password then they can attempt to log in using an empty password. The default member authenticator, login form and basic auth all require a non-empty password, however if a custom authentication method is used it may allow a successful login with the empty password.

  After being patched, blank passwords are no no longer allowed when members are created in the CMS. Programatically created Member records, such as those used in unit tests, still allow blank passwords.

  You may have some Member records in your system already which have empty passwords. To detect these, you can loop over all Member records with `Member::get()` and pass each record into the below method. It might be sensible to create a `BuildTask` for this purpose.

  ```
  use SilverStripe\Security\Member;
  use SilverStripe\Security\MemberAuthenticator\MemberAuthenticator;

  private function memberHasBlankPassword(Member $member): bool
  {
      // skip default admin as this is created programatically
      if ($member->isDefaultAdmin()) {
          return false;
      }
      // return true if a blank password is valid for this member
      $authenticator = new MemberAuthenticator();
      return $authenticator->checkPassword($member, '')->isValid();
  }
  ```

  Once you have identified the records with empty passwords, it's up to you how to handle this. The most sensible way to resolve this is probably to generate a new secure password for each of these members, mark it as immediately expired, and email each affected member (assuming they have a valid email address in the system).

  **Base CVSS**: [0.0](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:X/RC:C&version=3.1)

  #### Addendum - November 2, 2023

  [CVE-2023-32302](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32302) has been invalidated. Following discussions with the *National Institute of Standards and Technology* (NIST), it was determined that entries in the *National Vulnerability Database* can not have a CVSS of 0.

  While CVE-2023-32302 is no longer a valid vulnerability identifier, the rest of the information on this page remains relevant.
* ### SS-2023-001 - XSS vulnerability in underlying TinyMCE library

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))

  Versions Affected:silverstripe/admin: ^1.0.0
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/admin: 1.12.7, 1.13.0
  Release Date:2023-04-26

  An old version of TinyMCE includes an XSS vulnerability, which was patched in a later version. The vulnerability is described by TinyMCE:

  > A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor via the clipboard or APIs. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 4.9.10 or lower and TinyMCE 5.4.0 or lower.

  We reviewed the potential impact of this vulnerability within the context of Silverstripe CMS. We concluded this is a medium impact vulnerability given how TinyMCE is used by Silverstripe CMS.
