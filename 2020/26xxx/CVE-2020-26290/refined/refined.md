{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how Go's `encoding/xml` package handles XML namespace prefixes on elements and attributes, and how it handles XML directives. This can cause XML documents to be mutated during round trips through the `xml.Decoder` and `xml.Encoder` implementations. Specifically, namespace prefixes of elements and attributes can be changed, and XML directives can be modified.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-115: Misinterpretation of Input"
    ],
    "impact": "The mutations caused by encoding round trips can lead to incorrect or conflicting decisions in affected applications. This can cause equivalent lookups within an XML document to return different results during different stages of the document's lifecycle, and can cause XML document structure validation to succeed or fail based on the number of encoding round trips. In SAML implementations, this can lead to full authentication bypass and arbitrary privilege escalation by allowing an attacker to alter a signed SAML message to convey a different identity.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can inject maliciously crafted XML markup into a SAML message. The Go application will then parse and serialize the XML which can result in the XML message being modified. The modified message can then be used to bypass authentication.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject or manipulate XML messages that will be processed by the vulnerable Go application. The attacker needs to craft an XML message that contains elements, attributes or directives that trigger the mutation during round-trips through Go's encoder and decoder."
  },
  "affected_component": "Package `encoding/xml` in Go",
   "patches": [
    "The vulnerability is mitigated in Dex IDP version 2.27.0, github.com/crewjam/saml version 0.4.3, and github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2 version 0.6.0. The `github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator` can detect the presence of these unstable constructs in XML."
  ],
  "cve_id": "CVE-2020-26290",
   "additional_information": "This CVE is associated with a set of XML parsing vulnerabilities in Go's `encoding/xml` library. It is related to CVE-2020-29509 (XML attribute instability), CVE-2020-29510 (XML directive instability), and CVE-2020-29511 (XML element instability). A related vulnerability in goxmldsig is CVE-2020-15216. The core issue in all cases is that XML markup can be mutated during round-trips through Go's decoder and encoder implementations. This can have security implications in applications that rely on XML integrity, such as SAML implementations. The `github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator` module can detect these unstable constructs. The Go security team has also introduced changes to `encoding/xml` in Go 1.16 which allow disabling namespace prefix parsing entirely, however this may not be a reasonable solution for all use cases."
