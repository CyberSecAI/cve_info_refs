Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2020-26990**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing ASM files within Siemens JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is a type confusion condition that occurs due to inadequate data validation.
*  **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process. This means an attacker could potentially gain control of the application and the system it runs on.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious ASM file using the affected software.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious ASM file and convince a user to open it with the vulnerable application. This could be achieved through social engineering, malicious websites, or compromised file sharing platforms.
*  **Additional Details:**
    *   The vulnerability was reported to Siemens by the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
    *   Siemens has released version V13.1.0 of JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization to address this vulnerability.
    *   The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-CAN-11897

**Affected Products:**

*   JT2Go versions prior to V13.1.0
*   Teamcenter Visualization versions prior to V13.1.0

**Mitigation:**

*   Update to version V13.1.0 or later of both JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization.
*   Avoid opening untrusted files from unknown sources within the affected products.
