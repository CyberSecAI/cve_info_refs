- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Add Task" field, allowing for the injection of HTML code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored HTML injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML code, potentially leading to session cookie theft (allowing for user impersonation) or modification of the page content seen by other users. Specifically, the provided example shows how an attacker can redirect users to an attacker-controlled website by injecting an `<a>` tag.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects HTML code into the vulnerable "Add Task" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the application's "Add Task" functionality.
