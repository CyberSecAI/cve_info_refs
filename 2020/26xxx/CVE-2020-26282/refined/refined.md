Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26282:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability within the BrowserUp Proxy. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary Java Expression Language (EL) expressions into the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The core issue is that user-supplied input is not properly sanitized and is directly used within a template engine. This enables attackers to inject malicious code.
- **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Due to the ability to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the BrowserUp Proxy. This provides full control over the server and the data it handles.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves sending a malicious request to the BrowserUp Proxy with specially crafted input that includes Java EL expressions. These expressions are then interpreted and executed by the server, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the BrowserUp Proxy API.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability meaning an attacker on the network may be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by pwntester at Github Security Lab.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.2 of BrowserUp Proxy.
- The fix involves sanitizing user-provided messages to prevent the injection of EL expressions by escaping the characters `{`, `}`, `$`, and `\`.
- The advisory recommends upgrading to version 2.1.2 or higher immediately.
- There are no known workarounds.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component)

The vulnerability is considered high severity with a high EPSS score of 6.209%
