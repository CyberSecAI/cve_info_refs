Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-26136

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The GraphQL module in Silverstripe CMS, by default, accepts basic authentication. This allows a bypass of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) if the `silverstripe/mfa` module is installed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **MFA Bypass:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass MFA, which is intended to add an extra layer of security.
-   **Basic Authentication Default:** The default configuration of the GraphQL module enabled basic authentication, which was the main weakness here.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Compromised User Accounts:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to user accounts by bypassing MFA, provided they have the user's password.
-   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access and potential manipulation of data, depending on the compromised user's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Basic Authentication:** The attacker leverages the GraphQL module's basic authentication to bypass MFA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **User Credentials:** The attacker needs a valid username and password to exploit this vulnerability.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to access the GraphQL endpoint which was exposing the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
-   **Affected Versions:** `silverstripe/graphql` versions `^3.0.0` and `^4.0.0-alpha1`.
-   **Fixed Versions:** `silverstripe/graphql` versions `^3.5.0` and `^4.0.0-alpha2`.
-   **Severity:** Medium.
-   **Mitigation:** Basic authentication has been removed as a default method. It can be re-enabled, if desired, through configuration.
-   **CVSS Score:** 4.2 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)
