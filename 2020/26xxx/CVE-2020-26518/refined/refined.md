The provided content discusses a SQL injection vulnerability in Pandora FMS version 742, specifically CVE-2021-32099, not CVE-2020-26518. Therefore, it is **UNRELATED** to the specified CVE.

However, since the content provides detailed information on a different, relevant CVE, here is the analysis of the discussed SQL Injection vulnerability:

**CVE-2021-32099 Analysis (as described in the provided content):**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of the `session_id` parameter within the `chart_generator.php` file. This parameter is directly passed to the `PandoraFMS\User` class constructor, which then uses it in an SQL query without proper sanitization using the `db_get_row_filter()` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The `session_id` parameter, taken from the `$_REQUEST` array, is directly concatenated into an SQL `WHERE` clause, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
    *   **Insecure Session Handling:** The application uses the session ID from user-controlled input to query the database, without proper sanitization.
    *   **Lack of Context-Aware Sanitization:** The application uses `htmlspecialchars` for sanitization, which is not appropriate for SQL queries.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting malicious SQL code, an attacker can manipulate the database query results to impersonate any user, including the administrator.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** After successfully logging in as an administrator, other means of code execution already known to exist in Pandora FMS can be exploited, allowing complete takeover of the server.
    *   **Data Breach:**  Access to the Pandora FMS data, including data related to monitoring infrastructure is possible.
    *   **Compromise of Monitored Systems:** As monitoring solutions often have access to the devices they monitor, this can be a starting point to compromise other parts of the infrastructure.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request, either GET or POST, including a malicious session id.
    *   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The vulnerability can also be exploited via a CSRF attack, where a victim visiting a malicious website can inadvertently trigger the attack if they are logged in or their browser has access to the Pandora FMS instance. This eliminates the need to directly target internet-exposed instances.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *  **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs network access to the Pandora FMS installation, either directly or via CSRF.
    *  **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is present pre-authentication and can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
    *  **No Specific Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any existing account or privileges in Pandora FMS.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content mentions that the function `session_decode()` used after SQL Injection is capable of deserializing objects which presents another attack vector.
*   The patch implemented by the vendor uses the `io_safe_input()` function to sanitize the `session_id` parameter. However, the blog post raises concerns about the reliance on this function and suggests better sanitization methods such as prepared statements should be used instead.
