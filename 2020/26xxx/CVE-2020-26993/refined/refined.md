- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CGM files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow. The vulnerability occurs while trying to copy to a buffer in the font index handling function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted CGM file in the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious CGM file with the affected software (JT2Go or Teamcenter Visualization).
