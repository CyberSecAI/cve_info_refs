Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26277:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way `dbdeployer` handled symbolic links within tarballs during the unpacking process. It did not properly validate if symlinks pointed within the target extraction directory, which allowed for the creation of symlinks pointing to arbitrary locations outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unvalidated symlink creation: The tool naively created symlinks as specified in the tarball without checking their target location.
- Arbitrary file access: By creating symlinks pointing outside the extraction directory, attackers could potentially read or write to arbitrary files on the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file overwrite: An attacker could craft a malicious tarball containing a symlink to a sensitive system file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`). When extracted by a privileged user, the symlink would be created, and any process with write access to both the symlink and its target could overwrite the system file. This could lead to system compromise or instability.
- Information disclosure: If the user or other programs write to the symlinked file, the attacker may be able to access the content by writing to the symlink.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious tarball: The attacker needs to create a specially crafted tarball containing malicious symbolic links.
- Unsafe tarball source: The user must obtain the tarball from an untrusted source where the integrity cannot be verified

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create and distribute malicious tarballs.
- The target user must run `dbdeployer` with sufficient privileges to write to the target of the symbolic link.
- The user must download and unpack the malicious tarball.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of `dbdeployer` up to 1.58.1.
- The fix was implemented in version 1.58.2.
- The fix involves comparing the depth of the symlink target with the depth of the file being created, blocking operations when symlinks point outside of the extraction directory. Also, a check was added to see if the link points to an existing file, calculate its absolute name, and compare it with the absolute name of the extraction directory.
- The advisory explicitly mentions that using `filepath.EvalSymlinks` was not feasible as it could block legitimate use cases.
