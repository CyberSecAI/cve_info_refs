**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502):** The core issue is the insecure handling of deserialized data, allowing for potential manipulation and exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could lead to an attacker remotely executing arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
- **Compromise of Control System:** This could lead to a complete compromise of the industrial control system (ICS) that PcVue is monitoring and controlling.
- **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability:**  The advisory mentions the potential for exposure of sensitive data, and prevention of legitimate users from connecting to services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, indicating that an attacker does not need local access to the vulnerable system.
- **Network-based:** The attack vector is through network access to the web and mobile back-end server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable PcVue web and mobile back-end server.
- **Low Skill Level:** The advisory indicates a "low skill level to exploit," suggesting that exploiting this vulnerability may not require advanced expertise.
- **No Authentication Required:** The CVSS vector string indicates that no privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N) are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects PcVue versions 8.10 to versions prior to 12.0.17.
- This issue is related to the interface between the web & mobile back end and the web services hosted in Microsoft IIS.
- The vulnerability is one of three security issues (CVE-2020-26867, CVE-2020-26868 and CVE-2020-26869) affecting the same component of PcVue.
- Patches are available for Version 12 (12.0.17 Maintenance Release) and Version 11.2 (11.2.06097 Update).
- Mitigations include uninstalling the web and mobile backend or hardening firewall configuration to only allow authorized connections to the back-end server.
