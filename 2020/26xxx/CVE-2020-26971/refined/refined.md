Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26971:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper bounds checking within the WebGL implementation, specifically when handling blit operations. Certain blit values provided by the user were not correctly validated before being used in calculations, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow. When the user provides carefully crafted blit values, calculations within the `StretchedBlitNearest_PixelByPixel` function result in memory writes outside the allocated buffer, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:**  The overflow overwrites data in adjacent heap memory.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While the provided information does not confirm arbitrary code execution, memory corruption can potentially lead to it if an attacker can control the overwritten data. The crash indicates that it can lead to instability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **WebGL API:** The attack is triggered through the WebGL API function `blitFramebuffer()`.
*   **Malicious Web Content:** An attacker would need to craft malicious web content that uses specific parameters in calls to `blitFramebuffer` to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Render WebGL Content:** The attacker must be able to render WebGL content in a vulnerable version of Firefox or Thunderbird.
*   **Understanding of `blitFramebuffer` parameters:**  The attacker needs to understand how the parameters of `blitFramebuffer` influence the memory write operations in the underlying graphics implementation to craft an attack.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Products:** Firefox and Thunderbird
*   **Specific Function:** The vulnerability lies within the `StretchedBlitNearest_PixelByPixel` function in ANGLE, the graphics abstraction layer used by Firefox.
*   **Driver Dependence:** The vulnerability's manifestation appears to be dependent on the specific graphics driver, with some drivers being more susceptible than others. This is why it did not crash for all testers.
*   **Patch:** The patch implemented a constraint on the source and destination rectangles to prevent out-of-bounds accesses during blit operations.
*   **Mitigation:** A quicker fix of disabling "no-error mode" was also identified to better use ANGLE's validation, but the full fix was ultimately implemented for backports as well.
*   **Reproducibility:** The bug was reproducible on Windows 10 with specific drivers and Firefox versions.
*   **Disclosure Timeline:** The reporter planned a disclosure, but it was embargoed until the Firefox 84 release date.
*   **Cross-Browser Issue:** This issue may affect other browsers using a similar WebGL implementation, based on the use of ANGLE.
*   **Exploitation Difficulty:** While difficult, the vulnerability is considered exploitable, and therefore was treated as a high severity issue.
*   **Fix Verification:** The fix is verified through a new conformance test and was first landed in Firefox 85 before being backported to Firefox 84 and ESR 78.
