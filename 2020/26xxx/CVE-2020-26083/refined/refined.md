Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26083:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) does not properly validate user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw, specifically a stored XSS, where malicious code can be injected.
- Improper Input Validation: The root cause is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied input within the web-based management interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the web interface.
- Sensitive Information Access: The attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive browser-based information.
- Potential for further compromise: By executing arbitrary script, the attacker could potentially carry out other malicious activities like session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack vector is network-based, with a remote attacker capable of exploiting the vulnerability through the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Access: The attacker must have valid administrative credentials to access the web-based management interface.
- Remote Access: The attacker must be able to access the web interface remotely.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco ISE. It stems from the interface not properly sanitizing user input. An attacker with valid admin credentials can inject malicious script into the web interface. This can lead to arbitrary script execution in the browser of other users accessing the same interface, potentially compromising those users' sessions, cookies, and information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco ISE at the time of the advisory.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability; patching the software is the recommended solution.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- The CVSS score is 4.8, which is considered a medium severity rating, due to the need for admin credentials.
- The attack requires user interaction in the sense that an administrative user needs to access the interface where the malicious code has been injected.
