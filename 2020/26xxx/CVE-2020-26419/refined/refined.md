    "Description": "Multiple dissectors could leak memory.",
    "Root cause": "Memory leaks in multiple dissectors.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "Impact": "It may be possible to make Wireshark consume excessive CPU resources by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file. This can lead to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Injecting a malformed packet onto the wire",
      "Convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote."
