Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26275:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `next` URL parameter during login redirects within the Jupyter Server. The `_redirect_safe` function, intended to prevent open redirects, inadequately handles URLs, allowing for redirects to arbitrary external sites when no base URL prefix is set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect. A maliciously crafted link with a manipulated `next` parameter can redirect a user to an attacker-controlled website after they log in to the Jupyter server.
*   **Inadequate URL Validation:** The `_redirect_safe` function fails to properly validate URLs, particularly when a base URL is not configured. It does not correctly identify and block external URLs or URLs with potentially harmful schemes/paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to craft phishing attacks, redirecting users to spoofed login pages or malicious sites, potentially leading to credential theft or malware installation.
*   **Reputation Damage:** By redirecting users to malicious sites, an attacker can damage the reputation of the affected Jupyter server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Links:** An attacker creates a crafted URL pointing to a Jupyter server login page, with a manipulated `next` parameter to redirect to a malicious destination after login.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker may use social engineering to trick a user into clicking on the crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to know the address of a vulnerable Jupyter Server instance.
*   **Ability to Generate Links:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs with a manipulated `next` parameter and share them with potential victims.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix implemented in commit `85e4abccf6ea9321d29153f73b0bd72ccb3a6bca` involves stricter validation of the `next` parameter within the `_redirect_safe` function to prevent open redirects.
*   The advisory from GitHub mentions that running the server with a `base_url` prefix as a workaround.
*   The vulnerability is described as a moderate severity issue.
