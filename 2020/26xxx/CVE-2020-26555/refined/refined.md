The researchers identified that it was possible for an attacker spoofing the Bluetooth Device Address (BD_ADDR) of a device to complete BR/EDR pin-code pairing with that device without requiring knowledge of the pin code.\n\nFor this attack to be successful, an attacking device needs to be within wireless range of a vulnerable device supporting BR/EDR Legacy Pairing that is Connectable and Bondable. The attacker must be able to identify the BD_ADDR of the vulnerable device before it can launch the attack, generally requiring the device to be discoverable. If successful, the attacker will be able to complete pairing with a known link key, encrypt communications with the vulnerable device, and access any profiles permitted by a paired or bonded remote device supporting Legacy Pairing.\n\nThe Bluetooth SIG is recommending that potentially vulnerable devices not initiate or accept connections from remote devices claiming the same BD_ADDR as the local device.\n\nThe Bluetooth SIG continues to recommend that devices use Secure Simple Pairing or BR/EDR Secure Connections to avoid known vulnerabilities with legacy BR/EDR pairing.",
