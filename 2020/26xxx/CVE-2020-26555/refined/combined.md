## Bluetooth SIG Statement Regarding the ‘Impersonation in the Pin Pairing Protocol’ Vulnerability

Researchers at the Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information (ANSSI) have identified a security vulnerability related to BR/EDR pin-code pairing in Bluetooth® Core Specification versions 1.0B through 5.2. The researchers identified that it was possible for an attacker spoofing the Bluetooth Device Address (BD\_ADDR) of a device to complete BR/EDR pin-code pairing with that device without requiring knowledge of the pin code.

For this attack to be successful, an attacking device needs to be within wireless range of a vulnerable device supporting BR/EDR Legacy Pairing that is Connectable and Bondable. The attacker must be able to identify the BD\_ADDR of the vulnerable device before it can launch the attack, generally requiring the device to be discoverable. If successful, the attacker will be able to complete pairing with a known link key, encrypt communications with the vulnerable device, and access any profiles permitted by a paired or bonded remote device supporting Legacy Pairing.

The Bluetooth SIG is recommending that potentially vulnerable devices not initiate or accept connections from remote devices claiming the same BD\_ADDR as the local device.

The Bluetooth SIG continues to recommend that devices use Secure Simple Pairing or BR/EDR Secure Connections to avoid known vulnerabilities with legacy BR/EDR pairing.

The Bluetooth SIG is also broadly communicating details on this vulnerability and its remedies to our member companies and is encouraging them to rapidly integrate any necessary patches.  As always, Bluetooth users should ensure they have installed the latest recommended updates from device and operating system manufacturers.

For more information, please refer to the statement from the [CERT Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/799380/).

## Bluetooth SIG Statement Regarding the ‘Authentication of the LE Legacy Pairing’ Vulnerability

Researchers at the Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information (ANSSI) have identified a potential security vulnerability related to LE Legacy Pairing authentication in Bluetooth® Core Specification versions 4.0 through 5.2. The researchers identified that an attacker can reflect the confirmation and random numbers of a peer device in LE legacy pairing to successfully complete legacy authentication phase 2 without knowledge of the temporary key (TK).

Because the attacker does not acquire a TK, or valid short-term key (STK) during this attack, completing authentication phase 2 is not sufficient for an encrypted link to be established. The Bluetooth SIG does not consider this to be a method which can provide unauthorized access to a device.

For more information, please refer to the statement from the [CERT Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/799380/).

# 15th IEEE Workshop on Offensive Technologies

#### May 27, 2021, co-located with IEEE S&P and in cooperation with Usenix

### Overview

The Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT) aims to present a broad picture of offense and its contributions, bringing together researchers and practitioners across all areas of computer security. Offensive security has changed from a hobby to an industry. No longer an exercise for isolated enthusiasts, offensive security is today a large-scale operation managed by organized, capitalized actors. Meanwhile, the landscape has shifted: software used by millions is built by startups less than a year old, delivered on mobile phones and surveilled by national signals intelligence agencies. In the field's infancy, offensive security research was conducted separately by industry, independent hackers, or in academia. Collaboration between these groups was difficult. Since 2007, the Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT) has been bringing those communities together.

## Call for Papers

### Symposium Topics

Computer security exposes the differences between the actual mechanisms of everyday trusted technologies and their models used by developers, architects, academic researchers, owners, operators, and end users. While being inherently focused on practice, security also poses questions such as "what kind of computations are and aren't trusted systems capable of?" which harken back to fundamentals of computability. State-of-the-art offense explores these questions pragmatically, gathering material for generalizations that lead to better models and more trustworthy systems.

WOOT provides a forum for high-quality, peer-reviewed work discussing tools and techniques for attacks. Submissions should reflect the state of the art in offensive computer security technology, exposing poorly understood mechanisms, presenting novel attacks, highlighting the limitations of published attacks and defenses, or surveying the state of offensive operations at scale. WOOT '21 accepts papers in both an academic security context and more applied work that informs the field about the state of security practice in offensive techniques. The goal for these submissions is to produce published works that will guide future work in the field. Submissions will be peer reviewed and shepherded as appropriate. Submission topics include, but are not limited to, attacks on and offensive research into:

* Hardware, including software-based exploitation of hardware vulnerabilities
* Virtualization and the cloud
* Network and distributed systems
* Operating systems
* Browser and general client-side security (runtimes, JITs, sandboxing)
* Application security
* Analysis of mitigations and automating how they can be bypassed
* Automating software testing such as fuzzing for novel targets
* Internet of Things
* Machine Learning
* Cyber-physical systems
* Privacy
* Cryptographic systems (practical attacks on deployed systems)
* Malware design, implementation and analysis
* Offensive applications of formal methods (solvers, symbolic execution)

### Workshop Format

The presenters will be authors of accepted papers. There will also be a keynote speaker and a selection of invited speakers. WOOT '21 will feature a Best Paper Award and a Best Student Paper Award.

Note that WOOT'21 and other IEEE S&P workshops will be virtual.

### Regular Submission

WOOT â21 welcomes submissions without restrictions of origin. Submissions from academia, independent researchers, students, hackers, and industry are welcome. Are you planning to give a cool talk at Black Hat in August? Got something interesting planned for other non-academic venues later this year? This is exactly the type of work we'd like to see at WOOT '21. Please submitâit will also give you a chance to have your work reviewed and to receive suggestions and comments from some of the best researchers in the world. More formal academic offensive security papers are also very welcome.

### Systemization of Knowledge

Continuing the tradition of past years, WOOT '21 will be accepting "Systematization of Knowledge" (SoK) papers. The goal of an SoK paper is to encourage work that evaluates, systematizes, and contextualizes existing knowledge. These papers will prove highly valuable to our community but would not be accepted as refereed papers because they lack novel research contributions. Suitable papers include survey papers that provide useful perspectives on major research areas, papers that support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, or papers that provide an extensive and realistic evaluation of competing approaches to solving specific problems. Be sure to select "Systematization of Knowledge paper" in the submissions system to distinguish it from other paper submissions.

### Submission Requirements

Due to the short review timeframe, we will require an abstract registration this year. Abstract registration allows the reviewers to bid on the papers they are interested in and allows the authors to continue finalizing the paper until the paper submission deadline. When submitting, make sure to put in a descriptive abstract.

* Abstract registration deadline: **~~Wednesday, January 27, 2021, 11:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth)~~**
* Paper submission deadline: **~~Friday, January 29, 2021, 11:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth)~~**
* Notification date: **~~Monday, March 01, 2021~~**
* Workshop date: **~~Thursday, May 27, 2021~~**

#### What to Submit

Submissions must be in PDF format. Papers should be succinct but thorough in presenting the work. The contribution needs to be well motivated, clearly exposed, and compared to the state of the art. Typical research papers are at least 4 pages, and maximum 10 pages long (not counting bibliography and appendix). Yet, papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected.

The submission should be formatted in 2-columns, using 10-point Times Roman type on 12-point leading, in a text block of 6.5â x 9â. Please number the pages. Authors must use the IEEE templates, for LaTeX papers this is [IEEETran.cls version 1.8b](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/?lang=en).

Note that paper format rules may be clarified. Stay tuned.

Submissions are double blind: submissions should be anonymized and avoid obvious self-references (authors are allowed to release technical reports and present their work elsewhere such as at DefCon or BlackHat). Submit papers using the submission form.

Authors of accepted papers will have to provide a paper for the proceedings following the above guidelines. A shepherd may be assigned to ensure the quality of the proceedings version of the paper.

If your paper should not be published prior to the event, please notify the chairs. Submissions accompanied by non-disclosure agreement forms will not be considered. Accepted submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the WOOT '21 website; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

#### Policies and Contact Information

Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple competing academic venues, submission of previously published work without substantial novel contributions, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. Note: Work presented by the authors at industry conferences, such as Black Hat, is not considered to have been "previously published" for the purposes of WOOT '21. We strongly encourage the submission of such work to WOOT '21, particularly work that is well suited to a more formal and complete treatment in a published, peer-reviewed setting. In your submission, please do note any previous presentations of the work.

#### Vulnerability Disclosure

If the submission describes, or otherwise takes advantage of, newly identified vulnerabilities (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program or design weaknesses in a hardware system) the authors should disclose these vulnerabilities to the vendors/maintainers of affected software or hardware systems prior to the CFP deadline. When disclosure is necessary, authors should include a statement within their submission and/or final paper about steps taken to fulfill the goal of disclosure.

#### Ethical Considerations

Submissions that describe experiments on human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:

* Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authorsâ institutional ethics review boards (e.g., an IRB).
* Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect.
* If a paper raises significant ethical or legal concerns, including in its handling of personally identifiable information (PII) or other kinds of sensitive data, it might be rejected based on these concerns.

### WOOT '21 Artifact Evaluation

#### Important Dates

All deadlines are 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth):

* March 1: Invitation to authors of accepted papers to submit artifacts
* March 12: Artifact submission deadline
* March 13-March 26: Authors must be reachable for questions in this period
* March 27: Notification

#### Submission

Authors are expected to submit the following:

* A PDF with an abstract for the artifact, which specifies the core idea, the focus of the artefact, and what the evaluation should check
* A PDF of the most recent version of the accepted paper
* Documentation about the artifact (how to reproduce the contributions of the paper)
* A link to the artifact, which must be available anonymously (artifact evaluation is single-blind)

Please submit your artifacts to woot21-artifact-submit@vusec.net. Do not include any binary programs in attachments, but link to them where needed.

#### Overview

A scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond the document itself: software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on. In some cases, the quality of these artifacts is as important as that of the document itself, yet many of our conferences offer no formal means to submit and evaluate anything but the paper itself. To address this shortcoming, WOOT will run an optional artifact evaluation process, inspired by similar efforts in software engineering and security conferences.

#### Criteria

The AEC evaluates whether the artifact does or does not conform to the expectations set by the paper. We expect artifacts to be:

* consistent with the paper
* as complete as possible
* documented well
* easy to reuse, facilitating further research

#### Benefits

We believe the dissemination of artifacts benefits our science and engineering as a whole, as well as the authors submitting them. Their availability improves replicability and reproducibility and enables authors to build on top of each other's work. It can also help more unambiguously resolve questions about cases not considered by the original authors. The authors receive recognition, leading to higher-impact papers, and also benefit themselves from making code reusable.

#### Process

Artifact evaluation is a separate process from paper reviews, and authors will be asked to submit their artifacts only after their papers have been (conditionally) accepted for publication at WOOT.

After artifact submission, at least one member of the AEC will download and install the artifact (where relevant) and evaluate it. Since we anticipate small glitches with installation and use, reviewers may communicate with authors to help resolve glitches while preserving reviewer anonymity. The AEC will complete its evaluation and notify authors of the outcome.

For the camera ready version, authors that have successfully passed the evaluation process will receive dedicated badges on their papers to demonstrate that their paper has passed this additional evaluation. We also ask the authors to make the artifacts available such that others can replicate the results.

#### Artifact Details

To avoid excluding some papers, the AEC will try to accept any artifact that authors wish to submit. These can be software, hardware, data sets, survey results, test suites, mechanized proofs, and so on. Given the experience in other communities, we decided to not accept paper proofs in the artifact evaluation process. The AEC lacks the time and often the expertise to carefully review paper proofs. Obviously, the better the artifact is packaged, the more likely the AEC can actually work with it during the evaluation process.

While we encourage open research, submission of an artifact does not contain tacit permission to make its content public. All AEC members will be instructed that they may not publicize any part of your artifact during or after completing the evaluation, nor retain any part of it after evaluation. Thus, you are free to include, e.g., models, data files, or proprietary binaries in your artifact. Also, note that participating in the AEC experiment does not require you to later publish your artifacts, but of course we strongly encourage you to do so.

We recognize that some artifacts may attempt to perform malicious operations by design. These cases should be boldly and explicitly flagged in detail in the readme so AEC members can take appropriate precautions before installing and running these artifacts. The evaluation of exploits and similar results might lead to additional hurdles where we still need to collect experience how to handle this best. Please contact us in case you have concerns, for example when evaluating bug finding tools or other types of artifacts that need special requirements.

#### AEC Membership

The AEC will consist of about 5â10 members. We intend for other members to be a combination of senior graduate students, postdocs, and researchers. We seek to include a broad cross-section of the WOOT community on the AEC.

If you are interested in joining the AEC, or supervise PhD students who might be, please contact us at woot21-aec@vusec.net.

## Devices supporting Bluetooth Core and Mesh Specifications are vulnerable to impersonation attacks and AuthValue disclosure

#### Vulnerability Note VU#799380

Original Release Date: 2021-05-24 | Last Revised: 2023-07-13

---

### Overview

Devices supporting the Bluetooth Core and Mesh Specifications are vulnerable to impersonation attacks and AuthValue disclosure that could allow an attacker to impersonate a legitimate device during pairing.

### Description

The Bluetooth [Core Specification](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/core-specification/) and [Mesh Profile Specification](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/mesh-profile-1-0-1/)  are two specifications used to define the technical and policy requirements for devices that want to operate over Bluetooth connections. Researchers at the Agence nationale de la sÃ©curitÃ© des systÃ¨mes d'information ([ANSSI](https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/)) have identified a number of vulnerabilities in each specification that allow [impersonation attacks](https://francozappa.github.io/about-bias/publication/antonioli-20-bias/antonioli-20-bias.pdf) and AuthValue disclosures.

Devices supporting the Bluetooth Core Specification are affected by the following vulnerabilities:

#### Impersonation in the Passkey Entry Protocol

The Passkey Entry protocol used in Secure Simple Pairing (SSP), Secure Connections (SC), and LE Secure Connections (LESC) of the Bluetooth Core Specification is vulnerable to an impersonation attack that enables an active attacker to impersonate the initiating device without any previous knowledge (*CVE-2020-26558*). An attacker acting as a man-in-the-middle (MITM) in the Passkey authentication procedure could use a crafted series of responses to determine each bit of the randomly generated Passkey selected by the pairing initiator in each round of the pairing procedure, and once identified, the attacker can use these Passkey bits during the same pairing session to successfully complete the authenticated pairing procedure with the responder. Devices supporting BR/EDR Secure Simple Pairing in Bluetooth Core Specifications 2.1 through 5.2, BR/EDR Secure Connections Pairing in Bluetooth Core Specifications 4.1 through 5.2 and LE Secure Connections Pairing in Bluetooth Core Specifications 4.2 through 5.2 are affected by this vulnerability.

#### Impersonation in the Pin Pairing Protocol

The Bluetooth BR/EDR PIN Pairing procedure is vulnerable to an impersonation attack (*CVE-2020-26555*). An attacker could connect to a victim device by spoofing the Bluetooth Device Address (BD\_ADDR) of the device, reflect the the encrypted nonce, and complete BR/EDR pin-code pairing with them without knowledge of the pin code. A successful attack requires the attacking device to be within wireless range of a vulnerable device supporting BR/EDR Legacy Pairing that is Connectable and Bondable. Devices supporting the Bluetooth Core Specification versions 1.0B through 5.2 are affected by this vulnerability.

Devices supporting Bluetooth Mesh Profile Specification, versions 1.0 and 1.0.1, are affected by the following vulnerabilities:

#### Impersonation in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning

The Mesh Provisioning procedure could allow an attacker without knowledge of the AuthValue, spoofing a device being provisioned, to use crafted responses to appear to possess the AuthValue and to be issued a valid NetKey and potentially an AppKey (*CVE-2020-26560*). For this attack to be successful, an attacking device needs to be within wireless range of a Mesh Provisioner and either spoof the identity of a device being provisioned over the air or be directly provisioned onto a subnet controlled by the provisioner.

#### Predictable AuthValue in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning Leads to MITM

The Mesh Provisioning procedure could allow an attacker observing or taking part in the provisioning to brute force the AuthValue if it has a fixed value, or is selected predictably or with low entropy (*CVE-2020-26557*). Identifying the AuthValue generally requires a brute-force search against the provisioning random and provisioning confirmation produced by the Provisioner. This brute-force search, for a randomly selected AuthValue, must complete before the provisioning procedure times out, which can require significant resources. If the AuthValue is not selected randomly with each new provisioning attempt, then the brute-force search can occur offline and if successful, would permit an attacker to identify the AuthValue and authenticate to both the Provisioner and provisioned devices, permitting a MITM attack on a future provisioning attempts with the same AuthValue.

#### Malleable Commitment

The authentication protocol is vulnerable if the AuthValue can be identified during the provisioning procedure, even if the AuthValue is selected randomly (*CVE-2020-26556*). If an attacker can identify the AuthValue used before the provisioning procedure times out, it is possible to complete the provisioning operation and obtain a NetKey. Similar to CVE-2020-26557, identifying the AuthValue generally requires a brute-force search against the provisioning random and provisioning confirmation produced by the Provisioner. This brute-force search for a randomly selected AuthValue, which can require significant resources, must complete before the provisioning procedure times out.

#### AuthValue Leak

The Mesh Provisioning procedure could allow an attacker that was provisioned without access to the AuthValue to identify the AuthValue directly without brute-forcing its value (*CVE-2020-26559*). Even when a randomly generated AuthValue with a full 128-bits of entropy is used, an attacker acquiring the Provisionerâs public key, provisioning confirmation value, and provisioning random value, and providing its public key for use in the provisioning procedure, will be able to compute the AuthValue directly.

### Impact

#### Impersonation in the Passkey Entry Protocol

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to authenticate to the response victim device and act as a legitimate encrypted device. The attacker cannot pair with the initiating device using this method of attack, which prevents a fully transparent man-in-the-middle attack between the initiator and responder. For this attack to be successful, an attacking device needs to be within wireless range of two vulnerable Bluetooth devices that are initiating pairing or bonding for which a BR/EDR IO Capabilities exchange or LE IO Capability in the pairing request and response results in the selection of the Passkey pairing procedure.

#### Impersonation in the Pin Pairing Protocol

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to complete pairing with a known link key, encrypt communications with the vulnerable device, and access any profiles permitted by a paired or bonded remote device supporting Legacy Pairing.

#### Impersonation in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to successfully authenticate without the AuthValue. Once authenticated, the attacker could perform any operation permitted to a node provisioned on the subnet until it is either denied access or a new subnet is formed without the attacking node present.

#### Predictable AuthValue in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning Leads to MITM

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to successfully brute force the AuthValue and authenticate to both the Provisioner and provisioned devices, permitting a MITM attack on a future provisioning attempt with the same AuthValue.

#### Malleable Commitment

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain a NetKey, which could be used to decrypt and authenticate up to the network layer, allowing the relay of messages, but no application data decryption.

#### AuthValue Leak

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to compute the AuthValue and authenticate to the Provisioner and provisioned devices.

### Solution

Bluetooth users should ensure that they have installed the latest recommended updates from device and operating system manufacturers.

In addition to the two vulnerabilities affecting the Bluetooth Core Specification, the researchers also identified a potential security vulnerability related to LE Legacy Pairing authentication in Bluetooth Core Specification versions 4.0 through 5.2. The researchers claim that an attacker can reflect the confirmation and random numbers of a peer device in LE legacy pairing to successfully complete legacy authentication phase 2 without knowledge of the temporary key (TK). Because the attacker does not acquire a TK, or valid short-term key (STK) during this attack, completing authentication phase 2 is not sufficient for an encrypted link to be established. While the Bluetooth SIG does not consider this to be a method which can provide unauthorized access to a device, they still recommend that LE implementations requiring pairing and encryption use LE Secure Connections. The Bluetooth SIG also recommends that, where possible, implementations enable and enforce Secure Connections Only Mode, ensuring that LE legacy pairing cannot be used.

The Bluetooth SIG additionally makes the following [recommendations](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/key-attributes/bluetooth-security/reporting-security/) for each vulnerability:

#### Impersonation in the Passkey Entry Protocol

For the attack to succeed the pairing device needs to accept the same public key that it provided to the remote peer as the remote peerâs public key. The Bluetooth SIG recommends that potentially vulnerable implementations restrict the public keys accepted from a remote peer device to disallow a remote peer to present the same public key chosen by the local device, and the pairing procedure should be terminated with a failure status if this occurs.

#### Impersonation in the Pin Pairing Protocol

The Bluetooth SIG recommends that potentially vulnerable devices not initiate or accept connections from remote devices claiming the same BD\_ADDR as the local device. They also continue to recommend that devices use Secure Simple Pairing or BR/EDR Secure Connections to avoid known vulnerabilities with legacy BR/EDR pairing.

#### Impersonation in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning

The Bluetooth SIG recommends that potentially vulnerable mesh provisioners restrict the authentication procedure and not accept provisioning both random and confirmation numbers from a remote peer that are the same as those selected by the local device.

#### Predictable AuthValue in Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning Leads to MITM

The Bluetooth SIG recommends that mesh implementations enforce a randomly selected AuthValue using all of the available bits, where permitted by the implementation. A large entropy helps ensure that a brute-force of the AuthValue, even a static AuthValue, cannot normally be completed in a reasonable time.

#### Malleable Commitment

The [statement from the Bluetooth SIG](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/key-attributes/bluetooth-security/malleable/) notes: "AuthValues selected using a cryptographically secure random or pseudorandom number generator and having the maximum permitted entropy (128-bits) will be most difficult to brute-force. AuthValues with reduced entropy or generated in a predictable manner will not grant the same level of protection against this vulnerability. Selecting a new AuthValue with each provisioning attempt can also make it more difficult to launch a brute-force attack by requiring the attacker to restart the search with each provisioning attempt."

#### AuthValue Leak

The Bluetooth SIG recommends that potentially vulnerable mesh provisioners use an out-of-band mechanism to exchange the public keys.

| **VU#799380.5** | Not Affected |

#### Vendor Statement

MikroTik Bluetooth implementation does not work in a peer-to-peer scenario, where pairing is involved. MikroTik devices work in Bluetooth Advertiser and Scanner topologies, where Bluetooth devices advertise/broadcast data over Bluetooth advertising channels, and MikroTik routers just scan the air to capture the Bluetooth payloads. Once again, there is no pairing involved. Pairing scenarios are scenarios where, for example, your phone connects to your headset, making a peer-to-peer connection between the two devices. In MikroTik's case, we do not support pairing, so it does not affect us.
MESH vulnerabilities also do not affect us, as MikroTik does not support this feature.

The Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) standard has been around for over a decade, but it wasn’t until 2017 that the Bluetooth SIG released the [Bluetooth mesh standard](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/mesh-specifications). Competing with other mesh-capable standards like Zigbee and Thread, Bluetooth mesh is designed to enable applications within the IoT by, for the first time, allowing for many-to-many communication over Bluetooth LE.

A few things to know:

* **The Bluetooth SIG refers to the standard as Bluetooth mesh** (with a lower-case “m” in the word “mesh”).
* **The standard is not part of the Core Bluetooth standard** (rather it’s defined in its own separate set of specifications).
* That said, **Bluetooth mesh builds on top of BLE** and utilizes many of the concepts in BLE.
* **Bluetooth mesh utilizes only the advertising/scanning states of BLE devices.** This means that devices that are part of a Bluetooth mesh network must relay information to each other via advertising packets, which are received by the other devices via scanning.
* Bluetooth mesh supports all versions of BLE (going back to Bluetooth version 4.0, which is the first version of the Bluetooth specification that included BLE).
* **Bluetooth mesh does not support Bluetooth 5 features** such as advertising extensions and the long-range mode (coded PHY), as of October 2022.
* The maximum number of nodes within a Bluetooth mesh network (defined in version 1.0 of the specification) is **32,767 nodes**.
* The maximum hops a message can travel within a Bluetooth mesh network (defined in version 1.0 of the specification) is **127 hops**.

## What is Bluetooth mesh networking?

The Bluetooth mesh specification was released in July of 2017 with the goal of increasing the range of Bluetooth networks and adding support for more industrial applications that utilize Bluetooth LE.

Earlier versions of Bluetooth supported two different topologies:

* **One-to-one**: when two BLE devices are connected.
* **One-to-many**: when BLE devices operate exclusively in the Broadcast state, such as [Beacons](https://novelbits.io/what-is-a-beacon-guide-to-bluetooth-beacon-technology/).

BLE mesh introduced a new topology for BLE: **many-to-many.** This is generally referred to as **mesh topology,** where many mesh devices can communicate with many other mesh devices within the same network using mesh nodes. This essentially creates large-scale device networks (think hundreds, if not thousands, of devices) that can be used for a variety of IoT applications.

## Benefits of Bluetooth mesh

The main benefits of the Bluetooth mesh standard are:

* **Built on top of BLE:** Bluetooth mesh uses the same protocol stack as BLE. Smart devices with Bluetooth 4.0 or later (like many smartphones today) can utilize Bluetooth mesh technology directly.
* **Global interoperability:** devices and products from different manufacturers are guaranteed to interoperate as long as they are Bluetooth mesh certified according to the standard.
* **Scalability:** one of the main goals of Bluetooth mesh was to be scalable and be able to support a large number of participating nodes within a single network. Bluetooth mesh supports up to 32,767 elements (if each node has only one element, this makes this value the maximum number of devices per mesh network).
* **Reliability:** another goal was to make the standard reliable and be able to handle lost and/or corrupt messages.
* **Security:** security in Bluetooth mesh is mandatory to implement. This is compared to BLE where it’s optional and left to the developer to decide whether to implement or not in their application.

## BLE mesh vs other wireless mesh specifications (like Zigbee)

There are a few differences between the BLE mesh protocol and other mesh networks out there like Thread, Zigbee and Z-Wave. Some of the important ones are:

* **Bluetooth mesh does not use the Internet Protocol (IP)** — instead, it builds on top of BLE.
* **Bluetooth mesh uses a managed flooding** technique compared to[routing techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network#Routing_protocols) that other protocols use.
* **Bluetooth mesh has more robust security protocols** than others like Zigbee.
* **Bluetooth mesh is still primarily used for building automation applications**, such as automating smart home devices and lighting systems, while other protocols like Zigbee are more widely used for things like asset tracking and industrial automation.

## Bluetooth mesh networking – must-know concepts

To understand how Bluetooth mesh operates, there are a few (or maybe more than a few!) concepts you need to know:

* **Mesh nodes:** A mesh node is a device that has joined a Bluetooth mesh network. Devices that are not part of the network are called unprovisioned devices. Once an unprovisioned device gets provisioned, it joins the network and becomes a node.
* **Elements:** A node may contain multiple parts which can be controlled independently. For example, a light fixture may contain multiple light bulbs which can be turned on/off independently. These different parts of a single node are referred to as elements.
* **Models:** A model defines some or all functionality of a given element. There are three categories of models: server model, client model, and control model.
* **States:** Elements can be in various conditions, represented by state values. For example, on and off are states of a lightbulb within a light fixture. A change from one state to another is called a **state transition**. This can be instantaneous, or it can occur over time after what’s called a transition period. When a state change occurs, it is likely to cause a change in the behavior of an element.
* Properties: Properties add some context to a state value. For example, defining that a temperature value is an outdoor or indoor temperature. There are two types of properties: manufacturer property, which provides read-only access, and **admin property,** which provides read-write access.
* **Scenes:** A scene is a stored collection of states and is identified by a 16-bit number which is unique within the mesh network. Scenes allow triggering one action to set multiple states of different nodes. They can be triggered on-demand or at a specified time.
* **Messages:** Messages are the mechanism by which operations on nodes are invoked. If a node needs to report its status, it also sends it via a message. A given message type represents an operation on a state or collection of multiple state values.
* **Addresses:** Messages in a Bluetooth mesh network must be sent to and from an address.

## How does Bluetooth mesh communication work?

The way messages are exchanged in a Bluetooth mesh network is via the publish-subscribe pattern. **Publishing** is the act of sending a message. **Subscribing** is a configuration used to allow select messages to be sent to specific addresses for processing. Typically, messages are addressed to group or virtual addresses.

### Types of Bluetooth mesh messages

There are three types of messages in Bluetooth mesh, each of which is defined by a unique opcode (operation code):

* **A GET message**: a message to request the state from one or more nodes.
* **A SET message**: a message to change the value of a given state.
* **A STATUS message**: A status message is used in different scenarios:
  + In response to a GET message, containing the state value.
  + In response to an acknowledged SET message.
  + Sent independently of any message to report the element’s status. One example is a message that’s triggered by a timer running on the element sending this message.

Some messages require an acknowledgment message to be sent by the receiver of the original message. An acknowledgment message serves two purposes:

* Confirmation of receipt of the message.
* Return of data related to the message received.

If a response to the message is not received by the sender, or an unexpected response is received, the sender may resend the message. Multiple acknowledged messages received by a node do not affect the behavior (it’s as if the message was received once).

### Managed flooding

Many mesh networks use routing mechanisms to relay messages across the network. The other extreme is to flood the network with the messages being relayed without consideration of the optimal routes these messages need to take to reach their prospective destinations. Bluetooth mesh uses a technique that’s a compromise of both of these techniques. This technique is referred to as **managed flooding**.

Managed flooding relies on broadcasting messages to all nodes within range of the sender node, with a few added optimizations:

* **Messages have a TTL assigned
  TTL** stands for **time-to-live**, which limits the number of hops a message can take across multiple nodes within the mesh network. A value of **zero** indicates that a message *has* not been relayed and *should* not be relayed. This means that a node can send a message to other nodes which are in its direct radio range and indicate to the receiving node(s) that the message should not be relayed.
  If a message is sent with a **TTL ≥ 2**, then each time it is relayed, the TTL value gets decremented. A TTL value of **1** means that the message may have been relayed at least once, but that it should not be relayed again.
* **Messages are cached
  Message caching** is required by all nodes and requires that messages received that already exist in the cache get immediately discarded.
* **Heartbeat messages are sent periodically
  Heartbeat messages** are used to indicate to other nodes that the sender is alive and active within the network.
* **Friendship
  Friendship** refers to the relationship between two nodes. These two node types are:
  + A **low-power node**, or **LPN**, conserves power and is not able to receive mesh messages all the time. This node spends most of its time with the radio turned off.
  + A live-powered node called the **friend node,** which can serve as a proxy for the LPN. The friend node caches messages for the LPN to save power, so that the LPN can stay asleep most of the time and only wake up occasionally. When the LPN wakes up, it polls the friend node to read the cached messages and sends any messages it needs to send to the mesh network.

## Types of nodes

All types of nodes can send and receive mesh messages. However, optional features give particular nodes special capabilities. Here are the different types of nodes with optional features enabled:

* Relay nodes
* Proxy nodes
* Friend nodes
* Low power nodes

![Relay Node](https://mlv0gpv1snjt.i.optimole.com/cb:lAJ-.51688/w:244/h:262/q:90/f:best/ig:avif/https://novelbits.io/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)![Relay Node](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/9P2EXhTIKYcO8M20bilM05V8wJvWRuFu5Y6lFldMoeL0ik2rbThr10rTKYUs-M0VdV_aNGGtbOQO3Zu7fFmKqCALM0ZHTn4AKt9iS_ISB82Rry13hd9KrRlMPvK7tl1U1FkuwvXDKTtUxHUD1edRrobdYwdzX6tlNt5sMPh_uEDHGcxgZz5tbuPj6w)

*Relay node*

A node may support none, some, or all of these optional features, which may be enabled or disabled at any time. For example, a single node may have the features of a **relay node**, **proxy node**, and **friend node**, all at the same time.

### Relay nodes

A **relay node** is one that supports the relay feature. This means it can retransmit messages that are broadcast by other nodes. This enables extending the reach of these messages and allows them to traverse the entire network beyond the reach of the original transmitting node.

### Proxy nodes

To allow communication with a mesh network from a non-mesh-supported BLE device, a special type of node called a **proxy node** can be utilized. A proxy node acts as an intermediary and utilizes GATT operations to allow other nodes outside of the mesh network to interface and interact with the network.

![Proxy Node](https://mlv0gpv1snjt.i.optimole.com/cb:lAJ-.51688/w:279/h:280/q:90/f:best/ig:avif/https://novelbits.io/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)![Proxy Node](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/S7oW2PBrk850GTEhV-Gj5iZzUTpu2INLKjzzg4o0mOHAVsetZpn4kqszT-SCaecadG10x1Xe6OuEL40oB3RW_mEbA20OeLPP0ET_mS0CaaavjwVhbK5o1FeOZJTUVTBD7ze5zQpy3iELCRA1-_emhTef1z57fTPey8iJPbt1EVRI90qQVwanhvQrog)

*Proxy node*

The protocol used in this case is called the **proxy protocol**, which is intended to be used with a connection-enabled device (using GATT).

The protocol is built on top of GATT and allows a device to read and write proxy protocol PDUs from GATT characteristics exposed by the proxy node. The proxy node performs the translation between proxy protocol PDUs and mesh PDUs.

For example, this allows a smartphone that does *not* implement the Bluetooth mesh protocol to interact with a mesh network via a proxy device through GATT operations.

### Friend Nodes and Low Power Nodes

A **friend node** and a **low-power** node (LPN) are closely related to each other. In fact, in order for a low-power node to participate in a Bluetooth mesh network, it requires a *friendship* relationship with another node, called the **friend node**.

Here are how these two types of nodes work together:

![Friend nodes and low power nodes](https://mlv0gpv1snjt.i.optimole.com/cb:lAJ-.51688/w:237/h:238/q:90/f:best/ig:avif/https://novelbits.io/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)![Friend nodes and low power nodes](https://mlv0gpv1snjt.i.optimole.com/cb:lAJ-.51688/w:237/h:238/q:90/f:best/ig:avif/https://novelbits.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Friend-Node.png)

*Friend nodes and low-power nodes*

* Low-power nodes usually have limited power supply, such as batteries, so they need to conserve energy by keeping the radio off as much as possible.
* Low-power nodes may be concerned with sending messages more than receiving them. Take, for example, a temperature sensor powered by a coin cell battery. It may need to send the temperature reading once per minute whenever that reading is above or below a set limit. If the user decides to change the threshold limit, then that gets sent in a message to the temperature sensor. In order for the sensor to not miss this threshold configuration message, it needs to be on all the time, meaning it will consume a lot of power.
* To solve the problem mentioned in the previous point, the concept of a friend node is introduced. A friend node lets the low-power node stay asleep longer.
* Friend nodes make this possible by caching messages that are destined for the low-power node. The low-power node, at its control, wakes up and polls the friend node for these cached messages. When it polls for the messages, it also sends any messages it needs to relay to the network to its friend node.
* The relationship between a friend node and a low-power node is known as “friendship.”
* Friendship is key to allowing power-constrained nodes to participate in a mesh network while keeping their power consumption optimized.

## Bluetooth mesh example

Here’s an example of a mesh network in a home that’s composed of 6 light switches and 9 light bulbs. The network utilizes the publish-subscribe method to allow nodes to send messages to each other.

![](https://mlv0gpv1snjt.i.optimole.com/cb:lAJ-.51688/w:639/h:371/q:90/f:best/ig:avif/https://novelbits.io/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)![](https://mlv0gpv1snjt.i.optimole.com/cb:lAJ-.51688/w:639/h:371/q:90/f:best/ig:avif/https://novelbits.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bluetooth-mesh-publish-subscribe.png)

*Publish-subscribe in Bluetooth mesh lighting control system (Source: “Bluetooth Mesh – An Introduction for Developers”)*

Nodes may subscribe to multiple addresses. An example of this is light #3 in the above figure, which is subscribed to both the *kitchen* and the *dining room* group addresses. Also, multiple nodes may publish to the same address, such as switches #5 and #6 in this example. These two switches control the same group of lights located in the garden.

The benefit of using group or virtual addresses is that adding or removing nodes does not require the reconfiguration of nodes.

## Bluetooth mesh architecture

Bluetooth mesh builds on top of Bluetooth LE. It specifically utilizes the advertising state of BLE devices. Devices within a Bluetooth mesh network do not connect to each other as traditional BLE devices do. Rather, they use advertising and scanning states to relay messages to each other. There is one exception to this in a special device that can be part of the mesh network, the proxy node (which we covered in the previous section on “Node Types”).

![Bluetooth Mesh Architecture](https://mlv0gpv1snjt.i.optimole.com/cb:lAJ-.51688/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/f:best/ig:avif/https://novelbits.io/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)![Bluetooth Mesh Architecture](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/9_OctOxT1bxoEZpfNZDloKl4w9Bnz1JwCj0ti2lDLfHUQ6SOi_kBWCbsPY0yivrgPDpDdVrdLJwOulpQHxfOv5-hNdNKvRv-UMh8Dqca_wn0zlv0c9o88UW58pbiardzk70HIK6a7tP_mOXG0fIOVQOPDVTIzh3kQLhm03UWf2JDXMY1imtJCafdHQ)

*Bluetooth mesh architecture*

Here’s a description for each of the layers within the architecture of Bluetooth mesh (starting with the bottom layer):

1. **Bluetooth Low Energy layer**As we mentioned earlier, Bluetooth mesh builds on top of Bluetooth LE, so it requires a full BLE stack to be running on the device. It utilizes the advertising and scanning states for sending and receiving messages between devices within the mesh network. It also supports the connected state and GATT for the **proxy nodes**.
2. **Bearer layer**The **bearer layer** defines how the different mesh packets (Protocol Data Units or PDUs) are handled. There are two types of Bluetooth mesh bearers:
   * Advertising bearer: this bearer utilizes the advertising and scanning states of BLE devices.
   * GATT bearer: this bearer utilizes the connection state of BLE devices. It allows non-mesh supporting devices to interact with the mesh network via GATT operations. This is accomplished via the proxy node.
3. **Lower transport layer**This layer handles two main tasks:
   * Segmentation of packets from the layer above (upper transport layer)
   * Reassembly of packets from the layer below (bearer layer)
4. **Upper transport layer**This layer is Responsible for the following functionalities:
   * Encryption
   * Decryption
   * Authentication
   * Transport control messages (heartbeat, friendship, etc.)
5. **Access layer**This layer defines how the application uses the upper transport layer. It handles the following tasks:
   * Application data format
   * Encryption and decryption
   * Data verification
6. **Foundation Models layer**This layer is concerned with network configuration and network management models.
7. Models layer
   This layer addresses the implementation of **models**, including behaviors, messages, states, and state bindings.

## The provisioning process

The **provisioning process** is one of the most important concepts in Bluetooth mesh. It is used for adding devices to the mesh network. A device that gets added to the network is called a **node**, and the device used to add a node to the network is called the **provisioner** (usually a tablet, smartphone, or PC).

This process involves five steps:

### Step 1: Beaconing

Step 1 involves what’s called **beaconing**, where the unprovisioned device announces its availability to be provisioned by sending the **mesh beacon** advertisements in the advertisement packets. This is a new type of advertisement data type introduced in the Bluetooth mesh standard. A common way to trigger this process is via a defined sequence of button presses on the unprovisioned device.

### Step 2: Invitation

When the provisioner discovers the unprovisioned device via the beacons that were sent, it sends an **invitation** to this unprovisioned device. This uses a new type of PDU introduced in Bluetooth mesh called the **provisioning invite PDU**.

The unprovisioned device then responds with information about its capabilities in a **provisioning capabilities PDU**, which includes:

* The number of elements the device supports.
* The set of security algorithms supported.
* The availability of its public key using an **Out-of-Band (OOB)** technology.
* The ability of this device to output a value to the user.
* The ability of this device to allow a value to be input by the user.

![Provisioning Invite step](https://mlv0gpv1snjt.i.optimole.com/cb:lAJ-.51688/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/f:best/ig:avif/https://novelbits.io/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)![Provisioning Invite step](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/quwj0CDCbZO0Z5pJ2XjhBBLNBGqicZ3ykEUvu-QLrx6qSOkUui9t6N7ye6Lsrf30_QNQ8Ock3Csf4ByjSZUrcqLbsr_7VwE1PCf0Bg1FAWUxgqtfJp_z8ZixXfgzl7KzFF6iSfleGUl7SCi2CbLB0AhHYEWAu34YdgiYuMaTo7WP3MpubDfE7NrnUA)

*Provisioning invite step*

### Step 3: Public key exchange

Security in Bluetooth mesh involves the use of a combination of symmetric and asymmetric keys, such as the Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) algorithm. In ECDH, public keys are exchanged between the provisioner and the device to be provisioned. This is done either directly over BLE or via an **out-of-band (OOB)** channel.

![Public Key Exchange step](https://mlv0gpv1snjt.i.optimole.com/cb:lAJ-.51688/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/f:best/ig:avif/https://novelbits.io/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)![Public Key Exchange step](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/erdM0-APqQ7t_h4AXOAY_hkTmi_8b8b4DcdoJFn9HZRQ07AjtLeXE8vNGJ-HOAxAdp1SGE1IG1o2AE-tLSGkqU4TQz2KkaqJGFxxq3FKmP9PrWiL_HAbtcFS5n9puwsoY48WIKSXdXlOYqGohSilJfgy9xmUvZ0E5aIVP68tr5wbwRa4K1ZSOaRwMQ)

*Public key exchange step*

### Step 4: Authentication

The next step is to **authenticate** the unprovisioned device. This usually requires an action by the user to interact with both the provisioner and the unprovisioned device. The authentication method depends on the capabilities of both devices used.

In one case, called the **output OOB**, the unprovisioned device could output a random single- or multiple-digit number to the user in some form, such as blinking an LED a number of times. That number is then input into the provisioning device via some input method. Other cases include an **input OOB**, where the number is generated by the provisioner and entered into the unprovisioned device, a **static OOB**, or **no OOB** at all.

Regardless of the authentication method used, the authentication also includes a confirmation value generation step and a confirmation check step.

![Authentication step](https://mlv0gpv1snjt.i.optimole.com/cb:lAJ-.51688/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/f:best/ig:avif/https://novelbits.io/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif)![Authentication step](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tXFJZywo4fk12nqK4lbtlPegd2c1X61RKdcvAH2R-V4FW0o2WIvOwBXB6qDcktiApR-p2HyMjHbHWN0KkXjgc04SlxvNoIf_6p1_uDakvVJKNgWSOH6clrffU7myrmK2GxCRcYOP13ZsYEXcqWqvb3Mg2vmMkh8NF6-SbwaYGNZG1N2B7Ep7qOoRXg)

*Authentication step*

### Step 5: Provisioning data distribution

After authentication is complete, each device derives a **session key** using its private key, and the public key is sent to it from the other device. The session key is then used to secure the connection for the exchange of additional **provisioning data**, including the **network key (NetKey)**, a **device key**, a security parameter known as the **IV index**, and a **unicast address** which is assigned to the provisioned device by the provisioner. After this step, the unprovisioned device becomes known as a **node**.

## How is security handled in Bluetooth mesh?

The first important note regarding security in Bluetooth mesh is that it is *mandatory*. This is compared to BLE, where it’s optional and left to the developer to decide whether to include it or not.

Here are some of the basics of security in Bluetooth mesh:

* All mesh messages are encrypted and authenticated
* Network security, application security, and device security are all handled independently.
* Security keys can be changed during the life of the mesh network

Due to the separation of security between the network, application, and device levels, there are three types of security keys (each addressing a specific concern):

* **Network key (NetKey)**Possession of this shared key makes the device part of the network (also known as a node). There are two keys derived from the NetKey: the **network encryption key** and the **privacy key**. Possession of the NetKey allows a node to decrypt and authenticate up to the **network layer**, allowing the relay of messages but no application data decryption.
* **Application Key (AppKey)**This is a key that’s shared between a subset of nodes within a mesh network, normally those that participate in a common application. For example, a lighting system AppKey would be shared between light switches and light bulbs, but not with a thermostat or a motion sensor.
  An AppKey is used to decrypt and authenticate messages at the application level, but it is only valid within one mesh network, not across multiple networks.
* **Device Key (DevKey)**This is a device-specific key that’s used during the provisioning process for securing communication between the unprovisioned device and the provisioner.

### Node removal

One major concern with a mesh network is gaining access to a network via a discarded or removed device that used to be part of the network. This can be accomplished via gaining physical access to the keys stored within the device (often referred to as a **trash can attack**).

In order to protect against such an attack, Bluetooth mesh defines a procedure for the removal of a node where the device is added to a blacklist and the keys are refreshed. This process distributes new network keys, application keys, and other relevant data to all nodes except those in the blacklist.

### Privacy

Another concern is **privacy**. The way privacy is addressed in Bluetooth mesh is via the use of a **privacy key** that’s used to obfuscate the message header. The privacy key is derived from the network key (NetKey). For example, the source address could be obfuscated to prevent tracking of a device via its address.

### Replay attacks

The last security topic we want to cover is **replay attacks**. A replay attack is when one or more messages are stored and replayed later by a malicious device.

Bluetooth mesh provides protection against replay attacks by:

* Utilizing a **sequence number (SEQ)**. Elements increment the SEQ value every time they publish a message. A node, receiving a message from an element that contains an SEQ value that’s less than or equal to the one in the last valid message, will discard it (since it is likely that it relates to a replay attack).
* Using an incrementing **IV index**, which is an additional value that also gets validated when a message is received.

## Conclusion

While some may say that Bluetooth mesh has had a slow adoption rate, there’s still real potential for it to enable IoT applications in the near future.

In this post, we covered a lot, and there’s still so much more to learn about Bluetooth mesh. Look for a series of upcoming posts covering more of the implementation aspects of the technology, where we build out both a Bluetooth mesh light bulb and a light switch.
