# DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting

High

[apple502j](/apple502j)
published
GHSA-6qfq-px3r-xj4p
Nov 23, 2020

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<1.3.2

## Patched versions

1.3.2

## Description

Scratch Addons browser extension for Chrome and Firefox before version 1.3.2 is vulnerable to DOM-based XSS.

### Impact

If the victim visited a specific website, the More Links addon of the Scratch Addons extension used incorrect regular expression which caused the HTML-escaped values to be unescaped, leading to XSS.

CVSS v3.1 Score: 7.6(High) - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N

### Patches

Scratch Addons version 1.3.2 fixes the bug. The extension will be automatically updated by the browser.

### Workarounds

More Links addon can be disabled via the option of the extension.
