Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26213:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `errors.Exit` function in `teler` attempts to terminate the process by sending a `SIGTERM` signal. However, when running within a Docker container, the function fails to obtain the correct process ID and process group ID, leading to a segmentation fault (`SIGSEGV`) rather than a graceful termination.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of process IDs and group IDs within a Docker container environment when attempting to terminate the application, leading to a crash.
- Lack of proper error handling or fallback mechanism when `syscall.Getpgid` fails to get process group id.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) - The application crashes with `SIGSEGV` instead of exiting gracefully, making it unavailable. This occurs when the `errors.Exit` function is called within a Docker container due to an error or intentionally.

**Attack vectors:**
- By triggering the `errors.Exit` function within a Docker container environment. This could be done by causing an error in the application that calls this function or by making an intentional call.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to trigger a condition within `teler` that causes the `errors.Exit` function to be called. The attacker needs no specific position other than being able to interact with the application to trigger this condition, for instance by sending crafted requests that cause the application to enter an error state. The attacker does not need to have any system level access, as this is a vulnerability within the application itself that is triggered by sending normal requests.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is specifically triggered when `teler` is run inside a Docker container and calls the `errors.Exit` function. This issue was fixed by correcting how the process and group id's were obtained and handled before attempting a graceful shutdown.
- The fix implemented in commit `ec60820` addresses the issue by checking if the application is running inside a Docker container and directly calling `os.Exit` rather than using `syscall.Getpgid` which fails when run in docker and results in a segmentation fault due to a null pointer dereference when accessing `pgid` variable.
- The vulnerability is classified as having "Moderate" severity.
