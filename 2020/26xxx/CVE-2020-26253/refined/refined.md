{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of .dev domains and reverse proxy setups during the initial setup of the Kirby Panel. The system incorrectly assumes that .dev domains are local, which is not the case, and it can also fail to identify local installations behind a reverse proxy.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect assumption about the nature of .dev domains.",
      "Failure to properly identify local installations behind reverse proxies.",
	  "Insufficient security controls during initial setup."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially register the first admin account on a public server before the legitimate owner, thus gaining control of the Kirby Panel and the website.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker must discover a Kirby website using a .dev domain or hosted behind a reverse proxy.",
      "The attacker must access the `/panel` URL before the legitimate site owner registers the first admin account."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to find a vulnerable Kirby site with an unconfigured admin panel.",
      "Ability to access the `/panel` URL."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in Kirby versions before 3.3.6 and 2.5.14. The fix includes a better check for local environments, considering reverse proxy scenarios and the public nature of .dev domains. The CVSS score is 6.5 (Moderate), with specific metrics of AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N"
