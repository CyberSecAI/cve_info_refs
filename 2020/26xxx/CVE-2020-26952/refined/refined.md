Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26952:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect bookkeeping of functions inlined during JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation within the JavaScript engine. Specifically, during out-of-memory (OOM) conditions, the `inlinedChildren_` vector of the `ICScript` could be left with a bogus entry. If a second trial inlining was then performed, it could lead to a crash and memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to incorrect handling of inlined functions' data structures during OOM errors.
- A use-after-free condition could arise due to a bogus entry in the `inlinedChildren_` vector, leading to potential exploitation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A potentially exploitable crash due to memory corruption.
- The crash could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during JavaScript execution within the browser, specifically when inlining functions via the JIT compiler and encountering OOM errors.
- The provided test case shows that the `Function.call.bind()` method can be used to trigger this vulnerability when combined with `gc()` and `oomTest()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable application (Firefox).
- No specific user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability once the attacker's code is executed.

**Additional notes:**
- The bug report notes this as a `sec-high` issue.
- The issue was resolved by correctly handling OOM errors during inlining.
- The fix was included in Firefox 83.
- The bug was a regression introduced by changeset `cfb6ef22174c`.
