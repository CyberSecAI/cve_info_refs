Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26417:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the GitLab platform leaking certain user profile information even when the user has set their profile to private. This occurs due to insufficient access control checks when retrieving user data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Private user profile information, specifically group memberships, project memberships, and starred projects, is exposed to unauthorized users. This information should only be accessible to the user themselves or authorized personnel.
*   **Inconsistent API Behavior:** The issue mentions that the `starredProjects` data is leaked in both the GraphQL and REST APIs, indicating a systemic flaw in how private user data is handled across different API endpoints.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** Users who have set their profiles to private expect their information to be kept confidential. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to see details about their group and project affiliations, as well as their starred projects.
*   **Potential for Targeted Attacks:** Knowing a user's project and group memberships could enable attackers to tailor social engineering attacks or gather information about specific projects for malicious purposes.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **API Access:** The vulnerability is exploited by making requests to the GitLab GraphQL and REST APIs to retrieve user data. An attacker can query the API for information about a user, even if that user has set their profile to private.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **GitLab User Account:** An attacker needs a valid GitLab account to access the API and perform the requests that exploit this vulnerability. No special permissions or privileges are required.
*   **Knowledge of Username:** The attacker needs to know the username of the targeted user in order to query their data through the API.

**Additional Notes**

The provided content also mentions:
* A related issue  `#244275`  where a user's private email could be leaked via the graphql endpoint.
* The need to understand the impact on frontend components that rely on the leaked data points.

This vulnerability is related to privacy and information disclosure due to incorrect access control on private user data.
