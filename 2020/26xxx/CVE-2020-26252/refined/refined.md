{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to store an executable file on the server and load it via layout XML. This suggests an issue with how the system processes XML layout files, allowing for the inclusion of malicious code or references.",
    "Weaknesses": "The system allows an administrator with permissions to update product data to inject code through layout XML. There is a lack of sanitization or validation of the XML data, especially when processing blocks and methods.",
    "Impact": "An attacker could achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by injecting malicious code into layout XML. This allows for full control of the server, potentially enabling data theft, system disruption, and other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves manipulating product data, specifically injecting malicious code in the layout XML, which is processed by the system leading to the code execution.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have administrative privileges allowing them to update product data. This access is needed to inject the malicious payload into the layout XML."
