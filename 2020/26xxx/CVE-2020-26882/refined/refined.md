Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-26882

**Root Cause:** Carefully crafted JSON payloads sent as a form field can lead to Data Amplification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The vulnerability lies in how the Play Framework handles JSON payloads when they are submitted as part of a form (multipart/form-data). The framework is susceptible to a data amplification attack when processing such requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to data amplification. An attacker can send a relatively small malicious JSON payload, which will be processed by the server, leading to an excessive amount of processing, which can result in resource exhaustion and service disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based. Attackers can send malicious HTTP requests with crafted JSON payloads within a form field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable Play Framework application. No specific authentication or prior access to the application is necessary.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Play 2.8.0-2.8.2
*   Play 2.7.0-2.7.5
*   Play 2.6.x

**Fixes:**
*   This issue is fixed in Play 2.8.3 and 2.7.6. There will not be a fix for 2.6.x. Users of 2.6.x are advised to upgrade.

**CVSS Metrics:**
*   **Overall:** 6.7
