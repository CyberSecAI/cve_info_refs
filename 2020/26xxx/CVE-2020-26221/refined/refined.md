Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26221:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. This occurs because the application stores unsanitized user input that is later viewed by other users or administrators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored and executed within the context of other users' browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal user session tokens/cookies.
*   **Redirection:** Users can be redirected to malicious web pages.
*   **Arbitrary Browser Actions:** Attackers can perform unintended browser actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Can lead to remote code execution on victimâ€™s browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a field or area of the application where user-provided input is stored and later displayed.
*   Any user or administrator viewing the stored, malicious content will have the injected JavaScript executed within their browser session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to submit input to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not need to be in any special position with regards to the victim; they only need to be able to interact with the vulnerable application.
*   No special access to the victim's machine or network is necessary, as the exploit is performed within the user's browser session.
