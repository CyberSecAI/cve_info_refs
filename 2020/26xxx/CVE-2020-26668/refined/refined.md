Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1. Authenticated Remote Code Execution**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of user-supplied input when creating new settings, specifically within the `/core/admin/field-types/list/draw.php` component. The application allows the injection of malicious commands into the settings functionality.
*   **Vulnerability:**  Command Injection. The `parser` setting is set to `system`, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands through the `system()` function in PHP.
*   **Impact:** Remote arbitrary code execution. An attacker can execute system-level commands on the server, leading to a complete compromise of the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An authenticated user with developer privileges can create a new setting with a crafted request including a malicious command.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a valid user account with developer level access to the BigTree CMS instance.

**2. Authenticated SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:**  Lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-controlled input when creating new feeds within the `/core/feeds/custom.php` component. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL queries.
*  **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection. An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries via the `table` parameter when creating a new feed.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, which could lead to data leakage, modification, or complete database compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Authenticated user with developer privileges can create a new feed with a crafted request containing malicious SQL queries.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  Requires a valid user account with developer level access to the BigTree CMS instance.

**3. Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating or updating pages, specifically in the `site/index.php/admin/pages/update` component. This allows injecting malicious JavaScript into the page content.
*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via the page content during create or update operations and will be executed when the page is accessed.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities when the page is viewed by other users.
*  **Attack Vectors:** An authenticated user (with editor or publisher privileges) can inject malicious JavaScript into the page content when creating or updating a page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**  Requires a valid user account with editor or publisher level access to the BigTree CMS instance.
