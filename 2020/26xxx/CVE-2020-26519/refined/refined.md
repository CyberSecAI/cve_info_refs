Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-26519:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the MuPDF library when parsing JBIG2 files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** This occurs when the program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer on the heap. This can lead to memory corruption or other unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit could cause the application using MuPDF to crash or become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** While not explicitly stated in all sources, some sources suggest that the buffer overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution under certain conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted JBIG2 files:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious document that contains a malformed JBIG2 file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious JBIG2 file to a user who will then open it with an application using the vulnerable MuPDF library. This could be achieved through various methods such as:
    - Email attachments
    - Malicious websites
    - Delivery through other means

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in MuPDF versions prior to 1.18.0
- The issue is related to how MuPDF parses JBIG2 encoded data within PDF documents.
- Multiple distributions like Fedora and Debian were affected and released patches to address the issue.
- The vulnerability is considered to be exploitable locally and remotely
