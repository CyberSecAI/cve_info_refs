Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26879:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content directly references CVE-2020-26879 in the context of a security bulletin from Ruckus and in a detailed write-up from Adepts of 0xCC. The bulletin explicitly mentions "Ruckus IoT Controller Remote Command Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2020-26878, CVE-2020-26879)". The Adepts of 0xCC post further confirms that it is about a vulnerability in Ruckus vRIoT and details exploitation.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a combination of two issues:
    *   **Command Injection (CVE-2020-26878):** The `/service/v1/createUser` endpoint in the Ruckus IoT Controller web interface is vulnerable to command injection. User-supplied parameters (`username` and `password`) are directly concatenated into a string that is then executed via `os.system()`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands by using characters like `;`.
    *  **Authentication Bypass (CVE-2020-26879):** The vulnerability resides in how the `/service/v1/createUser` endpoint is accessed. While it is protected by an authentication mechanism, this mechanism can be circumvented via a "backdoor" that checks for the presence of an authorization token, but it is using a hardcoded value. If the request header "Authorization" does not have the prefix "Token ", the application attempts to decrypt the value of the header using a hardcoded key, compare the result with the value of `/VRIOT/ops/scripts/haN1/service_auth`. If this check is successful, the user has access to the endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input before using it in a command execution, leading to command injection.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** The secondary authentication logic can be bypassed because it uses a hardcoded key and value to decrypt and compare a token that can be easily generated.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** By chaining these vulnerabilities together, an unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands as root on the Ruckus IoT Controller.
    *   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control over the affected system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network-based attack:** The attack vector is through network requests to the Ruckus IoT Controller's web interface.
    *   **HTTP POST requests:** The vulnerabilities are exploited by sending specially crafted POST requests to the `/service/v1/createUser` endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Ruckus IoT Controller.
    *   **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to create and send custom HTTP requests to the controller.
    * **Knowledge of the hardcoded key and auth value:** The attacker needs to know the hardcoded key "serviceN1authent" and the value inside `/VRIOT/ops/scripts/haN1/service_auth`.

**3. Additional Notes:**

*   The Adepts of 0xCC blog provides a detailed walkthrough of the vulnerability discovery and exploitation process.
*   The Ruckus security bulletin mentions that the vulnerability affects Ruckus IoT Modules and recommends upgrading to RUCKUS IoT 2.2.0.0 (GA).
*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept exploit demonstrating the full chain RCE.
*   The `token_required` function is responsible for the authentication logic and contains the vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass it.

**Summary**

CVE-2020-26879, in conjunction with CVE-2020-26878, allows for unauthenticated remote command execution as root on Ruckus IoT Controllers. This is achieved through a combination of command injection vulnerability in the `/service/v1/createUser` endpoint and an authentication bypass via a hardcoded key and authorization value.
