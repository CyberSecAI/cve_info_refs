{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `shellCommand` property in LiveCode could be empty, leading to a malformed command line when trying to launch a process. This is particularly problematic on Windows systems where the shell command defaults to `command.com` or the `COMSPEC` environment variable.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `shell()` function didn't check if the `shellCommand` is empty before trying to use it. This could potentially lead to errors or unexpected behavior when the function tries to launch a process with a malformed command line.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "If the `shellCommand` is empty, the system might try to execute a malformed command, which could lead to the shell function failing or other undefined behavior.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability by setting the `shellCommand` property to an empty string.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to manipulate the `shellCommand` property within the LiveCode environment. This could be done by exploiting a related vulnerability, or by crafting a specific LiveCode script."
