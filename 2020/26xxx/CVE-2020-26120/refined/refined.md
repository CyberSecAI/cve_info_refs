Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the MobileFrontend extension in MediaWiki processes section headings on mobile devices. Specifically, the `PageGateway::getSectionsFromHTML` function extracts the HTML content of headings, and then attempts to strip `<a>` tags using a regular expression. This process does not correctly sanitize the content, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious HTML. The vulnerability is triggered by rendering the section title as part of the "edit section" link title attribute, which is later rendered in the browser without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is a stored XSS vulnerability. Malicious HTML injected into a section header is rendered unescaped on mobile view, allowing for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view a page on a mobile device. This can lead to:
  - Stealing user session cookies
  - Defacing the website
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Performing actions on the user's behalf without their knowledge
  - Other malicious activities within the scope of the userâ€™s session

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Section Headers:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious section heading that includes JavaScript within HTML tags, particularly within the title of an "edit" link.
- **Mobile View:** The vulnerability is specific to the mobile view of MediaWiki. The desktop view is not affected.
- **Edit links:** The vulnerability exists only on pages where there is an edit link for the section. Protected pages without edit links are not vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Content Modification:** An attacker needs the ability to modify content on a MediaWiki site. This would typically involve having editing permissions.
- **Target User:** The victim must access the page using the mobile interface to trigger the XSS.
- **JavaScript Enabled:** The user must have JavaScript enabled in their browser to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is introduced by the regular expression replace function in `PageGateway.js` :
   ```javascript
   section.line = section.line.replace( /<\/?a\b[^>]*>/g, '' );
   ```
- The code extracts the section heading HTML with `$( el ).html()` and then attempts to strip anchor tags, but this does not properly sanitize all potential attack vectors.
- The unescaped output in mobile view occurs because of how the section title is used to render the title attribute of the "edit section" link.
   ```html
   <a href="/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Sandbox/2020-09-07&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: <img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>"
   ```

- The fix involves removing the problematic regex, which is not essential, and ensuring proper escaping/sanitization in later stages.
- Patches were created and applied to different branches including: `REL1_31`, `REL1_34`, `REL1_35` and `master`.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability was present since 2014
- The issue was initially identified by a user "Paser24".
- The vulnerability was triggered via crafted section headings.
- The fix was deployed quickly by the developers.
