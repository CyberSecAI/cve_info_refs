| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1885947#c0)  Michael Kaplan    2020-10-07 10:51:32 UTC  ``` The Oberthur smart card software driver in OpenSC before 0.21.0-rc1 has a heap-based buffer overflow in sc_oberthur_read_file.  References: <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=24316> <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/commit/6903aebfddc466d966c7b865fae34572bf3ed23e>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1885947#c1)  Michael Kaplan    2020-10-07 10:52:19 UTC  ``` Created opensc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1885949](show_bug.cgi?id=1885949 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2020-26570 opensc: heap-based buffer overflow in sc_oberthur_read_file [epel-6]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1885948](show_bug.cgi?id=1885948 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-26570 opensc: heap-based buffer overflow in sc_oberthur_read_file [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1885947#c2)  Todd Cullum    2020-10-08 19:35:29 UTC  ``` Flaw summary: sc_oberthur_read_file() in src/libopensc/pkcs15-oberthur.c attempts to read an invalid record from the card reader APDU interface by reading a record greater than file->record_count, causing an out-of-bounds write.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1885947#c5)  Todd Cullum    2020-10-12 18:25:48 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  This flaw can be mitigated in cases where you can use opensc without the Oberthur driver enabled. In such cases, the vulnerable driver can be disabled by specifying them in /etc/opensc.conf card_drivers field in allowlist fashion. One such example:  ``` app default {    card_drivers = cac, cac1, PIV-II; } ```  This would only enable the cac, cac1, and PIV-II smart card drivers, and all others would be disabled, including the Oberthur driver. With the Oberthur driver disabled, this flaw is mitigated. It is important to list all drivers that you need in the card_drivers field so that they are not disabled too.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1885947#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-05-18 13:35:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2021:1600 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1600](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A1600)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1885947#c8)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-05-18 20:36:33 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-26570>   ``` |  |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-7c80831ffe
2020-12-12 01:03:49.584409
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : opensc
Product : Fedora 33
Version : 0.21.0
Release : 1.fc33
URL : <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki>
Summary : Smart card library and applications
Description :
OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart cards. Its
main focus is on cards that support cryptographic operations, and facilitate
their use in security applications such as authentication, mail encryption and
digital signatures. OpenSC implements the PKCS#11 API so applications
supporting this API (such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird) can use it. On
the card OpenSC implements the PKCS#15 standard and aims to be compatible with
every software/card that does so, too.

Subject: OpenSC 0.21.0 released

Hi all!

I'm happy to finally announce the new release 0.21.0 of OpenSC
<<https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/releases/tag/0.21.0>>. You can read a full
summary of the changes and get the release binaries on GitHub. We recommend
upgrading your installation, most notably for fixing CVE-2020-26570,
CVE-2020-26571 and CVE-2020-26572.

We've not only focused on fixing many bugs with different cards and
environments from a variety of vendors. This release also adds support for
two new types of tokens, Gemalto IDPrime and Polish eID card (e-dowód, eDO).

Regards,
Frank Morgner.
