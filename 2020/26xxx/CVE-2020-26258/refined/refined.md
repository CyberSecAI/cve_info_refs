Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26258:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from XStream's unmarshalling process. During unmarshalling (converting XML/JSON back into Java objects), XStream uses type information present in the input stream to recreate objects. An attacker can manipulate this input stream to inject or replace objects that trigger a server-side request forgery.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** By injecting malicious objects through the manipulated input stream, an attacker can force the application to make requests to internal or external resources that are normally not accessible.
*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** The core issue is the insecure deserialization of untrusted data, which can lead to arbitrary object instantiation and subsequent side-effects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially retrieve sensitive data from internal resources that are not publicly available by directing the server to request specific URLs.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The ability to make requests to arbitrary URLs may be used to bypass access controls or interact with internal APIs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated Input Stream:** The primary attack vector is the manipulation of the input stream (e.g., XML or JSON) during the unmarshalling process.
*   **Remote:** An attacker can remotely trigger this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input to a vulnerable application that uses XStream for deserialization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input to XStream:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the manipulated XML/JSON data to the vulnerable application's XStream deserialization process. This might be via a web service endpoint, a file upload, or any other means by which the application receives data.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without prior authentication, provided the attacker can supply the malicious input stream to XStream.
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the service that processes the malicious input using XStream.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided example demonstrates the vulnerability using XML as the input format, however the attack can also be performed with any supported format (e.g. JSON).
*   The attack uses specific Java classes to trigger a data source from a URL: `jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString` combined with `javax.activation.URLDataSource`.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the crafted XML is unmarshalled, resulting in an arbitrary URL request.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Whitelist:** The primary recommendation is to configure XStream's security framework with a whitelist of allowed types, rather than relying on the default blacklist. This will only allow XStream to instantiate objects of specified classes, preventing the injection of malicious types.
*   **Deny Types:** For users who insist on using a blacklist, the advisories suggest explicitly denying specific types known to be vulnerable (like `jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString`, `javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter`, and others).
*   **Upgrade:** Upgrade to XStream version 1.4.15 or higher, which includes fixes for the vulnerability.
