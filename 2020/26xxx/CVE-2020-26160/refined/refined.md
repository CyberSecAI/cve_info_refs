  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2020-26160",
    "description": "jwt-go before 4.0.0-preview1 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in situations with []string{} for m[\"aud\"] (which is allowed by the specification). Because the type assertion fails, \"\" is the value of aud. This is a security problem if the JWT token is presented to a service that lacks its own audience check.",
    "affected_component": "github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go",
    "affected_versions": "< 4.0.0-preview1",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a type assertion failure when the 'aud' (audience) claim in a JWT is an empty string array ([]string{}).  The code fails to properly handle the empty array, resulting in an empty string being used for audience validation. ",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Authentication (CWE-287)",
      "Missing Authorization (CWE-862)",
      "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions (CWE-755)"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can bypass intended access restrictions if a service relying on the vulnerable library does not perform its own audience check. This means that a token issued for one audience could be accepted by a service intended for a different audience, leading to unauthorized access.",
     "attack_vector": "Network",
    "attacker_capabilities": "No privileges are required. The attacker only needs to provide a maliciously crafted JWT with the empty array for the 'aud' claim.",
