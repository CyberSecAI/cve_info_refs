Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-26976:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that a service worker could intercept requests for HTTPS pages embedded in an HTTP page, even though the iframe was not considered a secure context due to the insecure framing. This was happening because the check for secure context was missing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Context Handling**: The primary weakness is the failure to properly enforce the secure context requirement for service worker interception. This allows a service worker registered for a secure page to be triggered within an insecure context (an HTTP page).
*   **Missing Security Check:** A check for a secure context was missing when a service worker was deciding whether or not to intercept a request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **HTTPS Resource Interception:** An attacker could potentially intercept requests for resources expected to be secure, even when loaded within a non-secure page. This means a service worker associated with a secure resource could be triggered and given control of the secure resource within the insecure HTTP page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Embedding in HTTP Pages:** The attack vector involves embedding a secure (HTTPS) page or iframe within an insecure (HTTP) page.
*   **Service Worker Registration:** The secure page must have a service worker registered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host an HTTP Page:** The attacker needs to be able to host or control an HTTP page.
*   **Embed HTTPS Content:** They need to be able to embed an HTTPS resource that has a service worker registered.

**Additional details from Bugzilla:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Andrew Sutherland.
*   The fix was implemented by Yaron Tausky.
*   The issue was initially classified as a moderate severity security vulnerability.
*   The fix was included in Firefox 84 and backported to Firefox ESR 78.7.
*   The vulnerability is related to the service worker implementation in Gecko.
*   The fix involved adding a check for secure context when deciding to intercept a request.
*   The fix was also added to web platform tests.
*   The issue was made public.
