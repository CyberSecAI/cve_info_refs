Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-26991:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing ASM files. Specifically, the application fails to validate a value before using it as a pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Untrusted Pointer Dereference:** The core weakness is that the application dereferences a pointer obtained from an untrusted source (the ASM file) without prior validation. This allows an attacker to control the memory location being accessed. (CWE-822)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through a malicious ASM file.
*   The user must open the malicious ASM file using the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to craft a malicious ASM file.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into opening the file with the vulnerable application (JT2Go or Teamcenter Visualization). User interaction is required.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability was assigned ZDI-CAN-11899 by the Zero Day Initiative
*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization prior to V13.1.0.2.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in the Siemens advisory SSA-695540.
*   The vulnerability was originally listed in SSA-622830, but was later moved to SSA-695540.
