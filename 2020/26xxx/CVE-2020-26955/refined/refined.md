Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26955:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Firefox for Android handles cookies during file downloads when in private browsing mode. Specifically, when a file is downloaded in private mode and a cookie is set, that cookie could be shared with subsequent file download operations on the same domain, even if those operations occurred in a normal browsing session.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core weakness lies in the improper handling of private browsing mode cookies during file downloads. The application was not correctly isolating cookies created during private browsing sessions, causing them to "leak" into normal browsing sessions. The `FETCH_FLAGS_ANONYMOUS` flag was not being correctly set when downloading files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact is the potential leakage of private browsing data to websites visited in normal browsing mode. An attacker could leverage this to track users across browsing modes. A site could set a unique identifier cookie in a private browsing session and then identify that user when they subsequently visit the same site in a normal browsing session through the leaked cookie.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves a user downloading a file from a website in private browsing mode, which results in a cookie being set. Subsequently, the same user would then visit the same website in normal browsing mode and initiate a file download. The previously set cookie from the private browsing session would be sent with the new request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to control a website and have the ability to serve files for download, setting cookies. They wouldn't need access to the user's device, but would need to entice the user to perform downloads in both normal and private browsing modes. The attacker would need to observe the requests being sent from the user.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was specific to Firefox for Android.
- The fix involved ensuring the `FETCH_FLAGS_ANONYMOUS` flag is set when performing downloads from private browsing mode.
-  The bug report also mentions the intention to fix the naming of `Request.CookiePolicy.OMIT`, as it implies no cookies, not the correct "use cookies from the PRIVATE cookie jar" functionality.
-  The issue was fixed in Firefox 83.
