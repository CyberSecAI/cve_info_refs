Arturo, do you know if we're sending a private mode cookie (?) when downloading?

I guess this means we'd be leaking PB mode to the site, not sure what impact that has though.

On ac, we don't manage cookies when downloading, GeckoView owns the cookies. I'm not sure how it manages cookies internally :owlish could help us to clarify. What I'm aware of it's that [we are not indicating](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/200fcd74905eff3f9b1672e96b1b0216634d9fe7/components/browser/engine-gecko-nightly/src/main/java/mozilla/components/browser/engine/gecko/fetch/GeckoViewFetchClient.kt#L57) to the `GeckoWebExecutor` (the piece that does the download) that we are on a private mode. I can see a flag [FETCH\_FLAGS\_PRIVATE](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/geckoview/src/main/java/org/mozilla/geckoview/GeckoWebExecutor.java#97) but it's package private.

Another thing is that we are on the middle of moving away from this api see [AC #8312](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/8312). I'm not aware either how cookies are manage with this new api.

I'm not familiar with the internal architecture but the HTTP request of `<a href download>` from Fenix has `MozacFetch` in `User-Agent` header (see the attached gif image in detail).

It seems the request is sent from the downloads feature of android-component.

Yes, it's initiated from `android-component` but the underneath api that it is performing the download it's part of GeckoView [see](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/200fcd74905eff3f9b1672e96b1b0216634d9fe7/components/browser/engine-gecko-nightly/src/main/java/mozilla/components/browser/engine/gecko/fetch/GeckoViewFetchClient.kt#L64) and [GeckoWebExecutor](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/geckoview/src/main/java/org/mozilla/geckoview/GeckoWebExecutor.java).

Re: cookies. I am not clear what the question is exactly, Arturo, can you clarify? Also, I'd need some explanation on "private mode cookies", as I am not aware what they are. Is that how browsing mode works in Fenix?

Also, and this is a bit unrelated, but since this bug is about cookies, it would be nice to see the actual cookie exchange for the requests (I only see the requests' method, URIs and response status on the attached gif, and I don't see any other information) - like a HAR file, for example. At the moment, it's not clear to me what is going on.

Oh, I just accidentally scrolled down on the gif and saw the rest of the info in the gif. Apparently, we're talking about `user=priv` cookie? I am still not clear what that cookie or what sets it.

The way GV API works, the API users are supposed to set the `FETCH_FLAGS_ANONYMOUS` flag on the download. With that flag, the cookies are not supposed to be passed. Am I understanding the bug correctly that the flag is set but the cookies are still being passed?

Looking at the source code, I see the flag is set [of CookiePolicy.OMIT flag is set](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/200fcd74905eff3f9b1672e96b1b0216634d9fe7/components/browser/engine-gecko-nightly/src/main/java/mozilla/components/browser/engine/gecko/fetch/GeckoViewFetchClient.kt#L64) but I can't trace where `CookiePolicy.OMIT` is set. Where is it being set, Arturo?

Also, Arturo, does the bug reproduce in the latest GVE? Does it reproduce in GVE at all? And clarification on the question and the browsing mode cookies is still needed :)

The issue is that the user is navigating in private session, and as a result of downloading a file, a cookie get written (`user=priv`). This cookie must be only available on private browsing but it's getting shared with normal sessions. As if the download were performed on a normal session.

Ok, that is the issue, we are not passing this flag, when downloading that is causing the issue. We have to fix that.

> Also, Arturo, does the bug reproduce in the latest GVE? Does it reproduce in GVE at all? And clarification on the question and the browsing mode cookies is still needed :)

I'm no sure we have to tests on it. Do you know if with the new GV API is aware of the type of session (private/nomal) where download is performed? Or from ac we have to do something special?

On the new API you wouldn't have to do anything special, it should work automatically. You have to set these WebExecutor flags now because now you have to perform a separate request for the downloads. With the new API, the need in the second request is eliminated, and the info on the browsing mode should already be in the channel by the time the download starts.

I agree with the `sec-moderate` rating Andrew gave it earlier.

> The way GV API works, the API users are supposed to set the FETCH\_FLAGS\_ANONYMOUS flag on the download. With that flag, the cookies are not supposed to be passed. Am I understanding the bug correctly that the flag is set but the cookies are still being passed?

That doesn't sound right. A download might require a cookie to work and ANONYMOUS would break that. Private Browsing isn't about not having cookies at all (web sites break!), it's about *not saving* the cookies to disk and *not mixing* them with your "normal" cookies. There are a *lot* of things tied up in Private Browsing that you won't be able to emulate from the front end. It's a "mode" that has to be supported in APIs (usually hung off a browsing context) from GeckoView through Android Components to the front end.

Private Browsing is implemented similarly to "Containers" in Gecko [kinda, for some things] so if you have to change APIs keep that in mind because it would be killer to be able to support Containers in a mobile browser.

That is exactly why we have just replaced that API with the new one, that doesn't require the second request.

Sorry, I overlooked that it was already rated. Thanks for the additional information!

Sebastian, I attached a patch for review. The commit messages is not entirely related to the issue to not reveal the security issue until it's patched.

So we are passing the `private` flag from the session to `DownloadState` so that we can control out fetch flags, which will set `FETCH\_FLAGS\_ANONYMOUS` for requests on behalf of a private tab when using `GeckoWebExecutor`. That sounds good to me. r+
But I do wonder if we have a related (for a new bug to file) problem here: If I am in a private tab and perform a download request, that we didn't get via the new API (e.g. for "save as", or when retrying a download) then we have no way of linking it to an existing, private `GeckoSession` to make use of the cookies available to that session. Is this something we would want to make possible or should at least discuss further in a separate bug?

nit: ContentState uses `private`. Maybe let's use the same name here.

```
        val cookiePolicy = if (download.private) {
            Request.CookiePolicy.OMIT
        } else {
            Request.CookiePolicy.INCLUDE
        }

```

I don't know the Fenix code, but "OMIT" sounds like no cookies at all rather than "use cookies from the PRIVATE cookie jar". That's certainly better than leaking the non-private cookies! But I'm pretty sure that's not web-compatible with some sites.

I agree, we should improve the name, I filed the issue [#8430](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/issues/8430) on AC for it. On ac `Request.CookiePolicy.OMIT` [gets translated](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/a1a5c582c28386a55f9dcc50f10f4a3011dd3742/components/browser/engine-gecko-nightly/src/main/java/mozilla/components/browser/engine/gecko/fetch/GeckoViewFetchClient.kt#L59) to GV as [GeckoWebExecutor.FETCH\_FLAGS\_ANONYMOUS](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/geckoview/src/main/java/org/mozilla/geckoview/GeckoWebExecutor.java#76), I think ideally we should be using something like [GeckoWebExecutor.FETCH\_FLAGS\_PRIVATE](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/geckoview/src/main/java/org/mozilla/geckoview/GeckoWebExecutor.java#97) but we don't have access from AC as it's package private on GV.

Sorina would the Mobile testing team check to see if this is fixed on Fenix 83. It should be broken on 82 as that has AC 60.

Verified this by comparing Beta 83.0 with RC 82.1.1:

After downloading the test file in private mode there is a "user: priv" cookie set.

Going to normal mode, just by loading the test page on RC 82 you can see that cookie already set, while on Beta 83 the cookie is not showing up on the page request in normal mode.

When you download the file in normal mode (with or without having set cookies in private mode), the cookie created has the same name so it is hard to tell if it's being transferred or is a different one, but I suppose that is expected. @Arturo, can you confirm?

Otherwise, this looks like it is fixed on Fenix 83.0 Beta.

Yes, it could be a bit confusing. As the site is not aware in which mode we are it just writes the cookie when the file is downloaded.

I tested on [Fenix 83 Beta](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/releases/tag/v83.0.0-beta.1) and I wasn't able to simulated the issue. If you would like to retest, one way to know that you are starting in clean state is by **Deleting the browsing data** or **Clearing the app storage** both should have the same effect as both clean all the data of Fenix.

If you need any additional help just let me know, happy to help :)

Attached file
[dummy\_manifest.json](attachment.cgi?id=9167785)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9167785&action=edit)

Fenix has a public interface that allows any apps to inject arbitrary PWA manifest for any origin.

That can be used for installing malicious PWAs on victim's device silently.

The installed PWA runs in fullscreen so spoofing address bar is possible by their contents.

Also through the malicious PWA's manifest, fake `share_target` (tries to steal victim's shared contents) can be registered (below).

<https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/blob/ba0d00e94b15bb5ad1383c726a66340b80d6fe14/components/concept/engine/src/main/java/mozilla/components/concept/engine/manifest/WebAppManifestParser.kt#L79>

The root cause is that `LauncherActivity` in Fenix is publicly accessible (below).

<https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L64>

That activity receives MANIFEST\_PATH key from incoming intent and store the specified manifest file to internal manifest database (below).

<https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/blob/16b677693832d54c64f2ab1f67f0a881a704889d/app/src/main/java/org/mozilla/fenix/customtabs/FennecWebAppIntentProcessor.kt#L93>

Here is the demo.

1. Save attached `dummy_manifest.json` file to your PC and send it to the connected Android device through ADB.

```
adb push dummy_manifest.json /data/local/tmp/dummy_manifest.json

```

2. Inject the manifest for example.com via `org.mozilla.gecko.WEBAPP` intent.

```
adb shell am start -a org.mozilla.gecko.WEBAPP -d 'https://example.com/' -n org.mozilla.fenix/org.mozilla.gecko.LauncherActivity --es MANIFEST_PATH /data/local/tmp/dummy_manifest.json

```

3. Then, example.com is shown in fullscreen (without address bar). That means PWA for example.com is injected.
4. Once inject the PWA, you can invoke through `mozilla.components.feature.pwa.VIEW_PWA` intent. Then, it runs again in fullsreen.

```
adb shell am start -a mozilla.components.feature.pwa.VIEW_PWA -d 'https://example.com/'

```

5. If you choose `Delete browsing data` from `Setting` menu, injected PWA can not be cleared.

   You need to remove all storage data of Fenix or re-install.

I've got a PR ready in Fenix to validate the manifest location inside the app files before reading it. Is something like "validates manifest folder" obscure enough for a Fenix bug/PR title?

Sebastian would you have a look? I was not able to see any behavior difference between 80.x and Nightly 83. Using the steps in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1657026#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Any websites can run with PWA privileges on Fenix") crashes with the display already required. If I kill the app between the two `adb shell` commands then it works.

In 80 I see us pick up the manifest and save it to disk for later and using the values from the manifest. In 83 the manifest gets rejected (since it is not in the expected location) and we launch in a "custom tab fallback mode" just loading the URL. So this looks good and as intended.

Along the way I found a possible crash (I used some invalid manifest) and opened a PR to catch parsing errors.

> Using the steps in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1657026#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Any websites can run with PWA privileges on Fenix") crashes with the display already required.

I didn't run into this one. Maybe we can look at this outside of this bug. If we can extract some STRs for the "display already acquired" bug then this would be helpful for something else. :)

It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 83

Announced
November 17, 2020
Impact
high
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 83

#### [#CVE-2020-26951: Parsing mismatches could confuse and bypass security sanitizer for chrome privileged code](#CVE-2020-26951)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
high
##### Description

A parsing and event loading mismatch in Firefox's SVG code could have allowed load events to fire, even after sanitization. An attacker already capable of exploiting an XSS vulnerability in privileged internal pages could have used this attack to bypass our built-in sanitizer.

##### References

* [Bug 1667113](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667113)

#### [#CVE-2020-26952: Out of memory handling of JITed, inlined functions could lead to a memory corruption](#CVE-2020-26952)

Reporter
Gary Kwong
Impact
high
##### Description

Incorrect bookkeeping of functions inlined during JIT compilation could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash when handling out-of-memory errors.

##### References

* [Bug 1667685](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667685)

#### [#CVE-2020-16012: Variable time processing of cross-origin images during drawImage calls](#CVE-2020-16012)

Reporter
Aleksejs Popovs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When drawing a transparent image on top of an unknown cross-origin image, the Skia library `drawImage` function took a variable amount of time depending on the content of the underlying image. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of image content through timing side-channel attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1642028](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1642028)

#### [#CVE-2020-26953: Fullscreen could be enabled without displaying the security UI](#CVE-2020-26953)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi of Microsoft Browser Vulnerability Research
Impact
moderate
##### Description

It was possible to cause the browser to enter fullscreen mode without displaying the security UI; thus making it possible to attempt a phishing attack or otherwise confuse the user.

##### References

* [Bug 1656741](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1656741)

#### [#CVE-2020-26954: Local spoofing of web manifests for arbitrary pages in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26954)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When accepting a malicious intent from other installed apps, Firefox for Android accepted manifests from arbitrary file paths and allowed declaring webapp manifests for other origins. This could be used to gain fullscreen access for UI spoofing and could also lead to cross-origin attacks on targeted websites.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1657026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1657026)

#### [#CVE-2020-26955: Cookies set during file downloads are shared between normal and Private Browsing Mode in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26955)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When a user downloaded a file in Firefox for Android, if a cookie is set, it would have been re-sent during a subsequent file download operation on the same domain, regardless of whether the original and subsequent request were in private and non-private browsing modes.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1663261](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663261)

#### [#CVE-2020-26956: XSS through paste (manual and clipboard API)](#CVE-2020-26956)

Reporter
Irvan Kurniawan (@sourc7)
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In some cases, removing HTML elements during sanitization would keep existing SVG event handlers and therefore lead to XSS.

##### References

* [Bug 1666300](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1666300)

#### [#CVE-2020-26957: OneCRL was not working in Firefox for Android](#CVE-2020-26957)

Reporter
Kevin Brosnan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

OneCRL was non-functional in the new Firefox for Android due to a missing service initialization. This could result in a failure to enforce some certificate revocations.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1667179](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1667179)

#### [#CVE-2020-26958: Requests intercepted through ServiceWorkers lacked MIME type restrictions](#CVE-2020-26958)

Reporter
Moti Harmats
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox did not block execution of scripts with incorrect MIME types when the response was intercepted and cached through a ServiceWorker. This could lead to a cross-site script inclusion vulnerability, or a Content Security Policy bypass.

##### References

* [Bug 1669355](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669355)

#### [#CVE-2020-26959: Use-after-free in WebRequestService](#CVE-2020-26959)

Reporter
Bharadwaj Machiraju
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During browser shutdown, reference decrementing could have occured on a previously freed object, resulting in a use-after-free, memory corruption, and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1669466](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1669466)

#### [#CVE-2020-26960: Potential use-after-free in uses of nsTArray](#CVE-2020-26960)

Reporter
Zijie Zhao
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `Compact()` method was called on an nsTArray, the array could have been reallocated without updating other pointers, leading to a potential use-after-free and exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1670358](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1670358)

#### [#CVE-2020-15999: Heap buffer overflow in freetype](#CVE-2020-15999)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Freetype, if PNG images were embedded into fonts, the `Load_SBit_Png` function contained an integer overflow that led to a heap buffer overflow, memory corruption, and an exploitable crash.
*Note: While Project Zero did discover instances of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild against Chrome, in Firefox this vulnerability is only triggerable if a rarely-used, hidden preference is toggled, and only affected Linux and Android operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected; and Linux and Android are unaffected in the default configuration.*

##### References

* [Bug 1672223](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672223)

#### [#CVE-2020-26961: DoH did not filter IPv4 mapped IP Addresses](#CVE-2020-26961)

Reporter
Gabriel Corona
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When DNS over HTTPS is in use, it intentionally filters RFC1918 and related IP ranges from the responses as these do not make sense coming from a DoH resolver. However when an IPv4 address was mapped through IPv6, these addresses were erroneously let through, leading to a potential DNS Rebinding attack.

##### References

* [Bug 1672528](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1672528)

#### [#CVE-2020-26962: Cross-origin iframes supported login autofill](#CVE-2020-26962)

Reporter
Paul Stone
Impact
low
##### Description

Cross-origin iframes that contained a login form could have been recognized by the login autofill service, and populated. This could have been used in clickjacking attacks, as well as be read across partitions in dynamic first party isolation.

##### References

* [Bug 610997](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=610997)

#### [#CVE-2020-26963: History and Location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser](#CVE-2020-26963)

Reporter
Sachin Raste
Impact
low
##### Description

Repeated calls to the history and location interfaces could have been used to hang the browser. This was addressed by introducing rate-limiting to these API calls.

##### References

* [Bug 1314912](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1314912)

#### [#CVE-2020-26964: Firefox for Android's Remote Debugging via USB could have been abused by untrusted apps on older versions of Android](#CVE-2020-26964)

Reporter
Muneaki Nishimura
Impact
low
##### Description

If the Remote Debugging via USB feature was enabled in Firefox for Android on an Android version prior to Android 6.0, untrusted apps could have connected to the feature and operated with the privileges of the browser to read and interact with web content. The feature was implemented as a unix domain socket, protected by the Android SELinux policy; however, SELinux was not enforced for versions prior to 6.0. This was fixed by removing the Remote Debugging via USB feature from affected devices.
*Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1658865](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1658865)

#### [#CVE-2020-26965: Software keyboards may have remembered typed passwords](#CVE-2020-26965)

Reporter
Makoto Kato
Impact
low
##### Description

Some websites have a feature "Show Password" where clicking a button will change a password field into a textbook field, revealing the typed password. If, when using a software keyboard that remembers user input, a user typed their password and used that feature, the type of the password field was changed, resulting in a keyboard layout change and the possibility for the software keyboard to remember the typed password.

##### References

* [Bug 1661617](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661617)

#### [#CVE-2020-26966: Single-word search queries were also broadcast to local network](#CVE-2020-26966)

Reporter
tiebuchen
Impact
low
##### Description

Searching for a single word from the address bar caused an mDNS request to be sent on the local network searching for a hostname consisting of that string; resulting in an information leak.
*Note: This issue only affected Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1663571](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663571)

#### [#CVE-2020-26967: Mutation Observers could break or confuse Firefox Screenshots feature](#CVE-2020-26967)

Reporter
Kaizer Soze
Impact
low
##### Description

When listening for page changes with a Mutation Observer, a malicious web page could confuse Firefox Screenshots into interacting with elements other than those that it injected into the page. This would lead to internal errors and unexpected behavior in the Screenshots code.

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Christian Holler, Jason Kratzer, Byron Campen, and Steve Fink reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
