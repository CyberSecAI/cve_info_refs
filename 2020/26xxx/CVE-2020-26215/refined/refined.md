Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26215:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is an open redirect in the jupyter-notebook application. A maliciously crafted link to a notebook server could redirect the browser to a different website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The application does not properly validate or sanitize URLs, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.
- The application redirects the user to a URL specified in the request without checking if the target URL is within the application or is a valid resource for the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious link that, when clicked, will redirect a user to a spoofed or malicious website. This can be used for phishing attacks or to trick users into visiting malicious sites.
- The impact is that a user might believe they are on a legitimate jupyter-notebook site, when in fact they're on a malicious site controlled by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious link.
- The attacker needs to get the victim to click on a crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to generate a malicious link to a jupyter notebook server.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network or have any other specific access to the vulnerable notebook server.
- The attacker needs to know or guess the hostname or URL of the target's notebook server

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in `notebook` version 6.1.5.
- The fix involves changes to how the application handles redirects, specifically trimming leading and trailing slashes in the path.
- The advisory mentions that a link may *appear* safe but redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. This implies that the open redirect might not be immediately obvious to the user.
- The fix modifies the `TrailingSlashHandler` in `notebook/base/handlers.py` to correctly sanitize the URL before redirecting.
- Tests were added to ensure proper handling of trailing slashes and redirects.
