The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Hoosk v1.8.0, specifically during the installation process. Here's a breakdown:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **0x01 install rce (Remote Code Execution)**
    *   **Root Cause:** User-supplied input from the `siteURL` parameter is directly written into the `config.php` file without proper sanitization.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/validation allows arbitrary PHP code injection.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by injecting malicious code into `config.php`.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `install/index.php` with malicious PHP code in the `siteURL` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Hoosk application.

*   **0x02 install SQLI (SQL Injection)**
    *   **Root Cause:** User-supplied input from the `siteName` parameter is concatenated directly into an SQL query string.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization/parameterization in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `install/index.php` with malicious SQL code in the `siteName` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Hoosk application.

*  **0x03 install xss (Cross-Site Scripting)**
    *   **Root Cause:** User-supplied input from the `siteName` parameter is reflected in the application without proper sanitization, making it vulnerable to XSS.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding or sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `install/index.php` with malicious JavaScript code in the `siteName` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Hoosk application and any victim who views the affected pages.

*   **0x04 install xss (Cross-Site Scripting)**
    *   **Root Cause:** User-supplied input from the `siteURL` parameter is reflected in the application without proper sanitization, making it vulnerable to XSS.
    *  **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding or sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `install/index.php` with malicious JavaScript code in the `siteURL` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Hoosk application and any victim who views the affected pages.

**Summary:**

The vulnerabilities exist in the `install/index.php` file due to improper handling of user-supplied inputs during the installation process. Specifically, the lack of sanitization/validation for the `siteURL` and `siteName` parameters leads to Remote Code Execution, SQL Injection, and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.
