  "CVE-2020-26262": {
    "analysis": "The provided content is related to CVE-2020-26262. It describes a loopback access control bypass vulnerability in coturn, a TURN/STUN server. The vulnerability allows an attacker to relay packets to the loopback interface by using specific peer addresses. The content includes details about the vulnerability, its impact, how it can be exploited, and the fix.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is an insufficient check for loopback addresses. The coturn server failed to properly block connections to loopback addresses when using `0.0.0.0` (IPv4), `[::1]`, or `[::]` (IPv6) as the peer address in a CONNECT request. The code responsible for validating peer addresses was not correctly handling these special cases, allowing them to bypass the intended loopback restrictions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation of peer addresses",
        "Insufficient access control mechanisms for loopback interfaces",
         "Failure to normalize IPv6 addresses leading to bypass"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can bypass the intended loopback restrictions of the coturn server, allowing them to relay packets to local network services. This can lead to unauthorized access to internal resources, potentially causing data breaches or allowing for further attacks against the server's environment.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Send a TURN CONNECT request with XOR-PEER-ADDRESS set to `0.0.0.0`, `[::1]`, or `[::]`."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send TURN requests to the coturn server, which can be achieved by being a client of the server or by impersonating a client. No prior authentication or complex setup is required since the vulnerability exists in the default configuration. An attacker could be located on the same network as the coturn server, or remotely if the coturn server is exposed."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The provided content includes detailed steps to reproduce the issue, including specific curl commands and expected log outputs. It also includes a timeline of the vulnerability discovery and fix, as well as credits to the researchers who identified the flaw. The fix involves adding an additional check to deny the use of `0.0.0.0/8` and `::/128` as peer addresses in allocation requests, along with fixing the IPv6 loopback check. It also notes that the previous logic was checking only the 8th byte for IPv6 loopback, instead of the correct 16th."
