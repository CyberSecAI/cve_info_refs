Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-26141:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to verify the Message Integrity Check (MIC) of fragmented TKIP frames.  The Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) is a data confidentiality protocol used in WPA and WPA2 networks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing MIC Verification:** Vulnerable Wi-Fi implementations do not perform a MIC check on fragmented TKIP frames. This is a deviation from the expected security procedures where the MIC is used to verify the authenticity and integrity of data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Packet Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary network packets into a WPA/WPA2 network using TKIP.
*    **Possible Decryption:** In addition to packet injection, it may also be possible to decrypt packets in the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wireless:** The attack occurs over a wireless network connection.
*   **Fragment Manipulation:** The attack involves crafting and sending fragmented frames where the MIC verification is skipped or bypassed by the vulnerable device

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within the wireless range of the target network to intercept and transmit Wi-Fi signals.
*   **Knowledge of TKIP:** The attacker needs to target a WPA/WPA2 network using TKIP and manipulate fragmented data
*   **Packet Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to craft and inject malicious fragmented data frames.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to TKIP, not CCMP or GCMP.
*   Some implementations incorrectly accept A-MSDUs encrypted with TKIP.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as an implementation flaw, and not a design flaw of the 802.11 standard itself.
