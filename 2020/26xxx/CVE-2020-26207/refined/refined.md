Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization within the DatabaseSchemaViewer application. The application was using BinaryFormatter, which is known to be susceptible to arbitrary code execution when processing untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsafe deserialization using `BinaryFormatter` which allows an attacker to embed malicious code within a `.dbschema` file, and have it executed when loaded by the vulnerable application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially gain complete control over the system running the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted `.dbschema` file. A user must be tricked into opening such a file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious `.dbschema` file.
- The attacker must convince a user to open the crafted file with the vulnerable DatabaseSchemaViewer application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes a patch that updates the application to use `XmlSerializer` instead of `BinaryFormatter`
- The commit log also shows a new `EscapeNames` property that provides the ability to disable escaping of table and column names in generated SQL, but this is not directly related to the deserialization vulnerability itself.
