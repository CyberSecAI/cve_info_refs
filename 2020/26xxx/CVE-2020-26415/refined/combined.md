# REST API & GraphQL API exposes starred projects of a user who has a private profile

While working on [#33563 (closed)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/33563 "View the Starred Projects in a Private Profile"), I noticed that both the

* REST API: <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#list-projects-starred-by-a-user>
* GraphQL API: <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#user> - `starredProjects`

exposes the details of projects starred by a user who has enabled a private profile.

Steps:

* As a user `A`, star at least 1 project.
* As user `A`, turn on private profile in Profile settings (in `/profile` - `Don't display activity-related personal information on your profiles`)
* Access details of user `A` as a user `B` via REST/GraphQL API
* The details of starred projects of user `A` are visible to user `B` (Please note that the starred project should also be visible to `B`, if not, the project is not shown. In short: Project visibility levels are honoured here.)

I am not sure if this is intended behaviour because <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/#private-profile> states that Starred projects of users with private profiles are not shown in their profile page.

However, the above page does mention that this behaviour is related to `profile page`.

But it still feels odd that starred projects of a user with private profile is not shown in their profile page, but if you use the API, you can still see this information.
