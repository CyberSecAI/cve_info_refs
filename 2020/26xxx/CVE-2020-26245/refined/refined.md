Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26245:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a prototype pollution issue in the `systeminformation` npm package. The code did not properly sanitize input strings, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of JavaScript objects. This could then be exploited to achieve command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The primary vulnerability is prototype pollution. By manipulating specific input strings, an attacker could add or modify properties of the `Object.prototype` which affects all objects. This was achieved due to a flaw in how input was sanitized before being processed in shell commands.
- **Command Injection:** The ability to pollute the prototype led to a secondary weakness where crafted inputs could be used to inject malicious commands when the sanitized input is used in shell commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system running the vulnerable application, potentially leading to:
- Data breaches
- System compromise
- Denial of service
- Privilege escalation

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through manipulation of input strings passed to the `si.inetChecksite()` function, and potentially other functions. These strings are used internally in the package and their processing was vulnerable to prototype pollution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to control or influence the input strings used by the `systeminformation` library, particularly those passed to vulnerable functions like `si.inetChecksite()`.
- The attacker needs to be able to pass the crafted input to a program that uses the vulnerable `systeminformation` library.
- No specific user privileges are explicitly mentioned but would depend on the context in which the vulnerable application runs.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.30.5 of the `systeminformation` package by rewriting shell sanitizations to prevent prototype pollution.
- A workaround was suggested, which involves sanitizing service parameter strings passed to `si.inetChecksite()` if upgrading to the patched version was not possible.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
