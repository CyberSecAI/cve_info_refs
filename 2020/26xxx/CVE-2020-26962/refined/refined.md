  "CVE-2020-26962": {
    "description": "Cross-origin iframes that contained a login form could have been recognized by the login autofill service, and populated. This could have been used in clickjacking attacks, as well as be read across partitions in dynamic first party isolation.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The password manager autofills credentials in iframes without checking if the iframe is same-origin with the top-level page.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Origin Credential Autofill",
        "Clickjacking"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could use a clickjacking attack to force a user to log into a particular site, and then perform some other attack that required the user to be authenticated.",
      "attack_vectors": "A malicious website loads a vulnerable site in a hidden iframe and gets the user to click, thereby auto-filling the credentials.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to lure a user to their malicious site."
