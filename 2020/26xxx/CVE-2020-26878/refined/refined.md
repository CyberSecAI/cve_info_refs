Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2020-26878 & CVE-2020-26879**

* **Root Cause:**
    *   **CVE-2020-26878**: Command injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input being passed to the `os.system()` function within the Ruckus vRIoT web service. Specifically, the `/service/v1/createUser` endpoint takes user-provided username and password parameters from the POST request and directly uses them in a system command.
    *   **CVE-2020-26879**: Authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the Ruckus vRIoT web service. The `token_required` function checks the "Authorization" header, but a specific code path for N+1 authentication allows for decryption of a specific value. This is compared against a hardcoded value in `/VRIOT/ops/scripts/haN1/service_auth`. A crafted header can therefore bypass authentication.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Command injection vulnerability in the web interface allowing execution of arbitrary OS commands.
    *   Authentication bypass vulnerability allowing access to restricted API endpoints without proper authentication.
    *   Use of hardcoded encryption key in `enc_dec.py` that can be used to generate valid authorization tokens.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Remote Command Execution (RCE) as root on the Ruckus vRIoT appliance. Attackers can gain full control of the system, potentially leading to data breaches, network compromise, and other malicious activities.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **CVE-2020-26878**: Sending a crafted POST request to the `/service/v1/createUser` endpoint with malicious commands injected into the username parameter.
    *   **CVE-2020-26879**: Sending a crafted `Authorization` header containing a value based on a hardcoded key.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Network access to the vulnerable Ruckus vRIoT instance.
    *   Knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoint (`/service/v1/createUser`).
    *   Ability to craft HTTP requests.
    *   For unauthenticated exploitation, knowledge of the hardcoded key for `n1_token` and the decryption process is required.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**

*   The blog post provides a detailed walkthrough of how the vulnerabilities were discovered, including steps for extracting the filesystem from the OVA, analyzing the web service code, and creating the exploit.
*   It identifies specific files involved, including python scripts (`web.py`, `enc_dec.py`) and configuration files (`/VRIOT/ops/scripts/haN1/service_auth`).
*   It provides the hardcoded `n1_token` value ("serviceN1authent") and how to generate a valid authorization header.
*   The post also demonstrates a working proof-of-concept exploit that combines the authentication bypass and command injection to achieve unauthenticated root RCE.
*   The vulnerable software is Ruckus vRIoT.
