Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-26223:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient check in the `ensure_order_token` function within the `OrderStatusController`. This function was checking for a truthy value of the order token instead of checking if it was actually present, using the `present?` method.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The `ensure_order_token` method considered an empty string (`''`) as a valid token.
- **Bypass of Token Verification:** The `by_token` method in `find_complete.rb` skips filtering by token when the token is not present. Since an empty string is truthy, the token filter was bypassed entirely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could query any complete order's status by sending an empty string as the order token. This bypasses the token-based access control and allows unauthorized access to order details.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **API Endpoint:** The attacker sends a request to the `/api/v2/storefront/order_status/<order_number>` endpoint.
- **Header Manipulation:** The attacker includes the `X-Spree-Order-Token` header with an empty string as the value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to know an order number.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests with a custom header (`X-Spree-Order-Token`).
- No authentication is required beyond access to the API endpoint.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in Spree versions 3.7.0 and later.
- The fix involves changing the token check to use `present?` instead of just checking truthiness in the `ensure_order_token` method, ensuring that an empty string is not treated as a valid token.
- Patched versions are 3.7.13, 4.0.5, and 4.1.12.
- Users of Spree < 3.7 are not affected.
