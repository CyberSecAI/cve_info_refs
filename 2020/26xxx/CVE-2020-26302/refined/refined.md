{
  "CVE-2020-26302": {
    "Root cause": "The `is.js` library uses a regular expression (copy-pasted from a gist) to validate URLs that is vulnerable to ReDoS.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The regex has ambiguity and overlapping clauses, leading to exponential backtracking."
    ],
    "Impact": "A specially crafted, malicious URL string can cause the regex engine to loop indefinitely, leading to a denial of service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can control the input to the vulnerable regular expression by providing a specially crafted string to be validated.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide an input string to the URL validation function in the `is.js` library."
  }
}
