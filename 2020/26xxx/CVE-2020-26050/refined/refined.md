Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the second document, which corresponds to CVE-2020-26050:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The SaferVPN for Windows application spawns `openvpn.exe` as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
*   `openvpn.exe` attempts to load an OpenSSL configuration file (`openssl.cnf`) from `C:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf`.
*   This directory does not exist by default, but low-privileged users can create directories and files under `C:\`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Configuration Loading:** The application attempts to load a configuration file from a user-writable location without proper validation or sandboxing.
*   **Privileged Process Execution:**  `openvpn.exe` runs with `SYSTEM` privileges, making it a prime target for privilege escalation.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate the content of the `openssl.cnf` file, allowing for the inclusion of malicious directives.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By creating a malicious `openssl.cnf` file that loads a custom OpenSSL engine (a malicious DLL), an attacker can execute arbitrary code with `SYSTEM` privileges.
*   **Full System Compromise:**  Successful exploitation leads to complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack is performed by a local, authenticated user.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker must create a specific directory structure (`C:\etc\ssl`) and place malicious files (`openssl.cnf` and a malicious DLL) within that structure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have a user account on the target Windows system.
*   **File System Permissions:** The attacker must have the ability to create directories and files under the `C:\` drive.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also references CVE-2019-12572 which is a similar vulnerability found in the PIA VPN client.
*   The vendor did not provide a fix even after the 90-day disclosure deadline.
*   The vulnerability affects SaferVPN for Windows versions 5.0.3.3 to 5.0.4.15
