Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26664:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow occurs in the `EbmlTypeDispatcher::send` function when processing a crafted MKV file. This is due to how VLC handles elements within the MKV file format during demuxing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability.
- Improper handling of malformed MKV files within the libmatroska and libebml libraries used by VLC.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running VLC.
- **Denial of service (DoS):** The vulnerability can also lead to a crash of the VLC media player.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious media file:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted MKV file. An attacker would need to entice a user to open this file using VLC.
- **Remote:** The attack is considered remote as the malicious file can be delivered through various means like websites, email attachments, or other file sharing methods.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious MKV file.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the crafted MKV file with a vulnerable version of VLC.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is located in `EbmlTypeDispatcher::send` in the `Ebml_dispatcher.hpp` file.
- The crash occurs due to a read of size 8 bytes outside of allocated memory.
- The fix involves updating to VLC version 3.0.12 or newer.
- Debian has addressed this vulnerability with security updates for both stable (buster) and LTS versions.
- Gentoo also issued a GLSA (GLSA 202101-37) to address the issue in their distribution.
- The vulnerability was reported by Zhen Zhou of NSFOCUS Security Team.
- The vendor (VideoLAN) responded quickly, confirmed the issue, and provided a fix soon after being notified.
