{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Zammad application's Create User functionality responds differently depending on whether the provided email is associated with an existing user account or not.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information disclosure vulnerability. The application's behavior allows an attacker to distinguish between valid and invalid user email addresses.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can enumerate valid user email addresses, which can be used for further attacks like password guessing or targeted phishing.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through the application's 'Create User' functionality. An attacker can send requests with different email addresses and analyze the responses.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the 'Create User' functionality. No prior authentication is required, making it accessible to anonymous users."
