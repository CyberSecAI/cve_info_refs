Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- User session identifiers were stored in cleartext, without any additional cryptographic hashing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage:** Session identifiers were stored in a manner that they could be easily read if the storage mechanism were compromised. This is a violation of the principle of secure storage of sensitive data.
- **Lack of Cryptographic Hashing:** The absence of hashing algorithms meant that the session identifiers were not protected against disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Chained Attack:** This vulnerability cannot be exploited directly. It requires a chained attack, such as an SQL injection or other vulnerability within the system. If an attacker can compromise another part of the system and gain access to the storage location of session identifiers, they can then steal and reuse the session identifiers.
- **Session Hijacking:** By stealing the cleartext session identifiers, an attacker could potentially impersonate a legitimate user, gaining access to the userâ€™s account and data. This can lead to significant compromise of sensitive user information and potentially allow unauthorized actions on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Indirect Exploitation:** The attack vector is not direct. An attacker must first exploit another vulnerability within the TYPO3 system (such as SQL injection) to gain access to the location where session identifiers are stored.
- **Access to Storage Location:** After exploiting a different vulnerability, the attacker needs access to the storage mechanism of the session identifiers. This could be a file system, database, or other storage mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Exploit another vulnerability**: Requires the attacker to be capable of exploiting another vulnerability within the system (e.g., SQL Injection).
- **Access to Storage**: Ability to access the storage location of session identifiers, whether this is file system access, or access to a compromised database.
- **Knowledge of System:** Basic knowledge of how user sessions and their identifiers are handled by TYPO3.
