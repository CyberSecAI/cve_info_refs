Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26071:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the command-line interface (CLI) of Cisco SD-WAN Software. Specifically, certain CLI commands do not properly sanitize user-supplied arguments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**: While not explicitly stated as "Path Traversal", the vulnerability allows writing to arbitrary files, implying the ability to bypass intended directory restrictions.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The core issue is the lack of proper checks on the arguments provided to certain CLI commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to create or overwrite files at any location on the affected device's file system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The ability to write to arbitrary files can be leveraged to cause a denial-of-service condition by overwriting critical system files or filling up disk space.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be authenticated to the system.
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute commands locally on the device's CLI.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-26071 is an arbitrary file creation vulnerability in Cisco SD-WAN software. An authenticated local attacker can leverage insufficient input validation in specific CLI commands to create or overwrite arbitrary files, leading to a potential denial-of-service. The vulnerability exists due to improper handling of user-supplied arguments to certain CLI commands.
