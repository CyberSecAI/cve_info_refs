Introduction:
-------------
codeBeamer Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) provides Project-, Task-,
Requirement-, Test- Change-, Configuration-, Build-, Knowledge- and Document
management in a single, secure environment. It enables software and hardware
development to be more collaborative, transparent and productive. [2]
ReqIF XML data is parsed by insecurely configured software components, which
can be abused for XML External Entity Attacks. [3]
Affected:
---------
Vulnerable:
10.0.0-final
10.1.0-final
10.1.SP4
Not Vulnerable:
20.11-lts
No other version was tested, but it is believed for the older versions to be
vulnerable as well.
Technical Description
---------------------
The XML parser used to read the ReqIF file content is not configured to deny
the resolution of external entities.
Special crafted ReqIF files, which trigger the deserializaiton of entities,
can be used to trigger XXE attacks.
In order to find a valid ReqIF file, it is possible to use the Export feature
accessible by clicking on the following
links:
"Projects" -> select one project where the logged-in user has admin rights
-> "Admin" -> "Export"
Here the modified ReqIF file used to read the content of the
C:\Windows\win.ini file:
```
xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?

## What is application lifecycle management (ALM)?

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is the strategic process of managing a software or product lifecycle from initial idea through design, development, testing, deployment, and end of life. ALM enables software engineering teams to efficiently collaborate on projects using proven Agile practices and trusted, up-to-date information. It is a foundational discipline for successful products, teams, and companies.

![overlaycontent](https://ptc-p-001.sitecorecontenthub.cloud/api/public/content/9aa319f5c2534a63b303f7e26d7b4dcd)

## Why is ALM important?

Application lifecycle management helps teams manage the inherent complexity of modern software development. Today, product value is increasingly delivered through software. For example, the average automobile is composed of microprocessors running over 100 million lines of code. ALM connects people, processes, and tools to align teams around common goals, speed software delivery, and simplify regulatory compliance.

## Key areas of ALM

### Governance

Establish a transparent, well-documented governance framework for software development. ALM enables organizations to establish transparent processes for decision-making and improve oversight and accountability of projects and software systems.

### Application Development

Navigate the inherent complexity of modern, Agile software development. Today's software engineers are vastly more productive than their predecessors of even a few years ago. This remarkable efficiency is delivered in the context of added complexity. By providing a single source of truth and end-to-end traceability for software development, covering requirements management, test management and project management, ALM makes modern software development possible.

### Maintenance

It's estimated that maintenance consumes 40-70% of the costs of the software lifecycle. Ongoing software maintenance is necessary to fix errors, maintain competitive parity, and respond to evolving customer needs. Application lifecycle management enables teams to efficiently track and manage changes and scheduled product releases over the lifetime of the product, enabling organizations to fulfill the promise of their product long after initial deployment.

## Six stages of application lifecycle management (ALM)

ALM stages vary from organization to organization, but typically include the following:

### Requirements Definition

Stakeholders analyze the problem and define the high-level scope of the solution. Over many iterations, requirements are refined and detailed.

### Design

Software architects and design engineers iteratively define the structure of the solution, identifying solution components, behavior, and relationships.

### Software Development

Software engineering teams composed of analysts, designers, developers, testers, and leaders work collaboratively to develop successive versions of the software.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

Everyone is responsible for quality. QA and risk management are part of every iteration, using tests that ensure the delivered software meets the original needs.

### Deployment

This phase covers the tasks of preparing, installing, and operationalizing software deliveries.

### Maintenance

Once released, support teams capture enhancements requests and defects. New releases provide an opportunity to fix errors and make software updates.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is ALM used for?

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is a discipline that is applicable to any software product or project that requires the orchestration of people, tools, and processes. ALM supports the development of software, components, or libraries, and much more.

### How does ALM support regulated industries?

Regulated industries, including aerospace and defense, [medical and pharmaceutical](/en/technologies/application-lifecycle-management/medical-device-development), and [transportation and automotive](/en/technologies/application-lifecycle-management/automotive-embedded-software), impose specialized requirements for building safety-critical products. These requirements govern both the safety and quality of the end products, as well as the rigor and auditability of the software development process itself. Because it provides a comprehensive governance framework, ALM excels at supporting software development in regulated industries. Specialized ALM capabilities can support IEC 82304-1, IEC 62304, [ISO 14971](/en/blogs/alm/iso-14971-and-medical-device-risk-management), FDA 21 CFR Parts 11 & 820, [ISO 26262](/en/resources/application-lifecycle-management/report/top-iso-26262-blunders), [ISO 13485](/en/resources/application-lifecycle-management/report/essential-iso-13485-qms-medical-devices), Automotive SPICE, CMMI, and other standards and regulations.

### What is the difference between ALM and PLM software?

ALM and PLM software work together to enable digital transformation. ALM excels at managing software requirements, test assets, and software releases throughout the software lifecycle. PLM excels at managing products, design documents, product platforms, and variants. [Together, ALM and PLM](/en/resources/application-lifecycle-management/ebook/top-five-use-cases-of-alm-plm-integration) empower organizations to manage their complete product portfolio.

### What software development processes does ALM support?

Application Lifecycle Management as a discipline is process-agnostic and can be used to implement any software development process. Specific ALM tools, however, may limit your choice of process. That's why it's important to select an ALM platform that supports and helps automate your preferred way of working, whether it's Scrum, SAFe, V-Model, or another Agile or hybrid process.

### What is the difference between SDLC and ALM?

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is the governance of software development throughout its lifecycle, whereas software development lifecycle (SDLC) is more precisely the initial development phase of the software itself, or the process used to define and execute a software build and implementation. While SDLC focuses on the technical aspects of development, ALM covers all activities from planning to retirement. SDLC is under the larger ALM canopy.

### What is the difference between ALM and DevOps?

ALM encompasses the entire lifecycle from inception through retirement, including requirements management, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance, to provide a centralized platform for managing these processes and enable collaboration among different teams and stakeholders.
DevOps is a software delivery approach to eliminate barriers between existing development and operations teams that evolved from agile practices requiring more harmony between development and operations teams. DevOps practices emphasize continuous integration and delivery, automation of infrastructure, and monitoring with the goal of increasing software delivery speed, reliability, and quality.

### Is ALM only for waterfall teams?

While ALM methodologies were originally developed to support traditional waterfall development processes, they are adaptable to various development methodologies, including agile, iterative, and hybrid approaches. Codebeamer is custom-built to help teams go agile. Teams that prefer waterfall can continue to use that methodology, or if they seek to mix both methodologies on their road to agile adoption, they can leverage the [agile-waterfall hybrid features](/en/blogs/alm/sdlc-risk-management-in-agile-and-waterfall-environments) in Codebeamer. ALM’s primary goal is to provide a centralized platform for managing the entire lifecycle of an application, regardless of the specific development methodology being used.
