| [Description](#c0)  PJ    2002-09-07 05:41:52 UTC  ``` Since 3.1 BETA is now out and in the package.mask file, and as far as I can  tell 3.1 ALPHA is no longer in the portage tree, you might want to remove this.  From the package.mask file:  =kde-base/arts-1.0.6 =kde-base/kdelibs-3.1_alpha1 =kde-base/kde-3.1_alpha1 =kde-base/kdeaddons-3.1_alpha1 =kde-base/kdeadmin-3.1_alpha1 =kde-base/kdeartwork-3.1_alpha1 =kde-base/kdebase-3.1_alpha1 =kde-base/kdebindings-3.1_alpha1 =kde-base/kdeedu-3.1_alpha1 =kde-base/kdegames-3.1_alpha1 =kde-base/kdegraphics-3.1_alpha1 =kde-base/kdemultimedia-3.1_alpha1 =kde-base/kdenetwork-3.1_alpha1 =kde-base/kdepim-3.1_alpha1 =kde-base/kdesdk-3.1_alpha1 =kde-base/kdetoys-3.1_alpha1 =kde-base/kdeutils-3.1_alpha1  There is an author note attached to it, but I am unsure if it still applies.  -PJ ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-09-07 07:11:48 UTC  ``` Let's give it a little more time. I already tried doing that once and got lots  of bugreports from people who didn't use emerge rsync --clean, still had the  alpha1 ebuilds and suddenly saw them as unmasked. Keeping the extra mask hurts  no one.  ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Bart Verwilst    2002-09-07 13:38:33 UTC  ``` Just a note, emerge sync uses --clean automatically now eh :o)  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Bart Verwilst    2002-09-07 13:38:52 UTC  ``` Just a note, emerge sync uses --clean automatically now eh :o)  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-09-07 15:20:11 UTC  ``` I know, we're talking about users with old systems here.  ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-10-05 08:43:59 UTC  ``` OK, should be safe enough now.

# Motion: Denial of service — GLSA **202208-18**

A vulnerability in Motion allows a remote attacker to cause denial of service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/motion** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.3.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.3.2** |

### Background

Motion is a program that monitors the video signal from one or more cameras and is able to detect motions.

### Description

The Motion HTTP server does not correctly perform URL decoding. If the HTTP server receives a request for a URL containing an incomplete percent-encoded character, a flaw in parsing results in an infinite loop trying to parse the rest of the character, which eventually results in a denial of service condition when reading out-of-bounds.

### Impact

A remote attacker can trigger a denial of service condition in Motion.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Motion users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/motion-4.3.2"

```
### References

**Release date**
