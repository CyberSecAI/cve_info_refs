Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26566:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Motion HTTP server does not correctly perform URL decoding. Specifically, it has a flaw in parsing incomplete percent-encoded characters within a URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper URL decoding leading to an infinite loop.
- Out-of-bounds read due to the infinite loop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) condition. The server becomes unresponsive due to the infinite loop, which eventually leads to reading out of bounds and crashing.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attacker sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing a URL with an incomplete percent-encoded character.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Motion server.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of Motion prior to 4.3.2.
- Gentoo users are advised to upgrade to version 4.3.2 or later to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The provided Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 202208-18) confirms and details this vulnerability.
- The GitHub issue #1227 is related, however, it refers to inability to use "%" sign as a parameter value, which may be related to the same code flaw but doesn't directly describe the vulnerability.
