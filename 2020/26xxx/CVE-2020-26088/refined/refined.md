  "CVE-2020-26088": {
    "description": "A missing CAP_NET_RAW check in NFC socket creation in net/nfc/rawsock.c in the Linux kernel before 5.8.2 could be used by local attackers to create raw sockets, bypassing security mechanisms, aka CID-26896f01467a.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the absence of a capability check (CAP_NET_RAW) before allowing the creation of a raw AF_NFC socket in the Linux kernel. ",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing privilege check (CAP_NET_RAW)"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could bypass intended security restrictions by creating raw AF_NFC sockets without proper authorization, which could be used to eavesdrop or inject NFC traffic.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
