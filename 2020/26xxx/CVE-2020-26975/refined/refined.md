Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26975:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content directly relates to CVE-2020-26975. The bug report ([Bug 1661071](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1661071)) is explicitly associated with the CVE ID.
*   The security advisory from mozilla.org lists CVE-2020-26975 with the description matching the vulnerability found in the bug report

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper validation of HTTP headers passed through `Browser.EXTRA_HEADERS` in Firefox for Android when an intent is received from a third-party application.
*   Specifically, the application did not check if the headers being set were in the list of forbidden headers, which can lead to session fixation or other malicious activities.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of input validation on the headers received from the intent.
*   **Use of `Browser.EXTRA_HEADERS`:** The vulnerability stems from allowing external applications to inject arbitrary headers into a request through the `Browser.EXTRA_HEADERS` bundle.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Fixation:** An attacker can modify the `Cookie` header, leading to session fixation. This could allow an attacker to potentially hijack a user's session.
*   **Abuse of Ambient Authority**: An attacker can inject headers to abuse the user's stored credentials for a website.
*   **Spoofing**: An attacker may be able to use a crafted header to cause unexpected behavior in the application and/or server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Android App:** The attack vector is a malicious Android application installed on the user's device.
*   **Intent Injection:** The attacker uses a crafted intent with `Browser.EXTRA_HEADERS` to inject malicious headers when launching a URL in Firefox for Android.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Android App Installation:** The attacker needs the capability to get a malicious application installed on the victim's Android device.
*   **Android Intent Expertise**:  The attacker needs knowledge of how to use Android Intents and include extra parameters that will be used by Firefox.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially rated as "sec-low" but was later upgraded to "sec-moderate"
*   The fix involves adding a header filtering mechanism that aligns with the CORS safelisted headers.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-26975 is a security vulnerability in Firefox for Android where a malicious application could inject arbitrary HTTP headers, leading to session fixation and other potential issues. This was possible because Firefox for Android was not validating headers passed through the `Browser.EXTRA_HEADERS` intent extra. The fix involved filtering headers to prevent the injection of forbidden headers.
