Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-26121:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the MediaWiki's `FileImporter` extension.  Specifically, the extension was not properly checking if a target page was protected against creation before importing a file. This allowed users to import a file, effectively creating a new page, even when the target page was protected against creation for the importing user. The upload protection was not recorded for pages that don't exist, assuming a page needs to be created before a file can be uploaded

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The `FileImporter` extension failed to enforce the access control restrictions defined by page protection settings. Specifically, it didn't check if the importing user had the rights to *create* a page when importing a file.
*   **Missing/Flawed Validation:** The `FileImporter` extension had checks to see if a user was allowed to upload files, but failed to also check if the user was allowed to create the page the file was being uploaded to.
*   **Incorrect Order of Checks:** The order of checks in `Special:Upload` for upload and create permissions were in an incorrect order. The upload permissions had a higher priority, and the create permissions were treated as optional.
    
**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Page Protection:** An attacker, without the necessary page creation rights, could import a file and create a page, even if that page was explicitly protected against creation. This bypasses intended security measures and allows for unauthorized content to be introduced into the system.
*   **Potential for Abuse:** This could be used by malicious actors to introduce unwanted content, deface pages that should be protected, or potentially use it as a jumping point for other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Import Functionality**: An attacker can exploit the `FileImporter` extension's file import feature.
*   **Inter-wiki imports**: An attacker can import a file from another wiki to a protected page on a target wiki, bypassing protection on the target wiki.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the source wiki to initiate the file import.
*   **No Page Creation Rights:** The attacker does not need to have page creation rights on the target wiki where they are importing the file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was identified by a user on Wikimedia Commons (CptViraj).
*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding an explicit check for create permissions in the `FileImporter` extension, alongside existing checks for upload permissions.
*   The fix was deployed to production and backported to relevant release branches.
*   A CVE identifier (CVE-2020-26121) was assigned to this vulnerability.
*   The fix involves changes in the `FileImporter` extension.
