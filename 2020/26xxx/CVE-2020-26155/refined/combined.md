# Utimaco – CVE-2020-26155

By [![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/462a60668e300e714892975cd4fb5dcc?s=35&d=mm&r=g)](https://secureyourit.co.uk/wp/author/rmdavy-uk/)

Last updated on [13th March 202117th April 2021](https://secureyourit.co.uk/wp/2021/03/13/utimaco-cve-2020-26155/)

During a pentest last year I found an issue which affected the Windows installation product packages for the following products from Utimaco

SecurityServer 3.x, 4.x up to version 4.31.1
PaymentServer 3.x, 4.x up to version 4.33.0
PaymentServer Hybrid 3.x, 4.x up to version 4.33.0
Block-safe 2.0.0, 3.0.0
CryptoServer CP5 5.0.0.0, 5.1.0.0, incl. CryptoServer CP5 Supporting CD and CryptoServer CP5 SDK CD
CryptoServer CP5 VS-NfD 5.1.0.0
CryptoServer SDK 3.x, 4.x up to version 4.31.1

The issue related to weak folder permissions which allowed for an escalation of privileges

The HSM Firmware was not affected by this issue.

Utimaco were very responsive when I reported this to them and kept me informed throughout their remediation process.

A security advisory document was produced for their clients which can be viewed using the Download button below.

# HSMs for General Purpose Use Cases

[Contact us](https://utimaco.com/service/consultancy/contact-sales)

Providing security for a wide range of cryptographic use cases

Cryptography is becoming increasingly crucial in infrastructures and organizations across various industries for numerous business use cases such as [Public Key Infrastructure](/solutions/applications/public-key-infrastructure "Public Key Infrastructure") requirements, key generation, storage, and processing, digital signing services, securing blockchain systems, subscriber authentication in mobile networks, and so on. As a result, there is a range of new obligations and responsibilities related to how these secrets are processed, stored, and used, even based on country-specific regulations.

[Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)](/service/knowledge-base/hardware-security-modules/what-hardware-security-module-hsm "What is a Hardware Security Module (HSM)?") are not only the most proven secure method for cryptographic use cases, but they have also fulfilled new market obligations and responsibilities for decades. HSMs are physical devices that perform cryptographic operations such as key generation and storage, identities and database management, key exchange and [encryption](/service/knowledge-base/technology-encryption "Encryption"), and decryption to ensure the safety of business secrets.

## Utimaco’s General Purpose HSMs for securing your most sensitive assets

## [Siemens – CVE-2020-25245, CVE-2020-28392](https://secureyourit.co.uk/wp/2021/03/13/siemens-cves/)

After reviewing some Siemens software, I found a couple of issues which related to Insecure Folder Permissions which I reported to their security team. The Siemens team was very responsive and kept me informed throughout their review process. The issues which I reported were remediated and Siemens released two CVE’s and bulletins for which I[Continue reading Siemens – CVE-2020-25245, CVE-2020-28392](https://secureyourit.co.uk/wp/2021/03/13/siemens-cves/)

## [VBA and Function Pointers](https://secureyourit.co.uk/wp/2020/11/28/vbafunctionpointers/)

Having written a few posts and demonstrated some different methods of bypassing AMSI using VBA, here’s another small post demonstrating another technique which I found is possible as a result of some Advanced Googling… I was studying the courses by Sektor7 (all of which I recommend) and one of the topics covered is run time[Continue reading VBA and Function Pointers](https://secureyourit.co.uk/wp/2020/11/28/vbafunctionpointers/)

## [Enumerating Process Modules in VBA](https://secureyourit.co.uk/wp/2020/04/18/enumerating-process-modules-in-vba/)

I’ve written a few posts which are all about AMSI and VBA recently and have hopefully shown that bypassing it is pretty trivial and can be done in a number of different ways. I just wanted to document one more combination of techniques that can be used to get the address of AMSIScanString and AmsiScanBuffer[Continue reading Enumerating Process Modules in VBA](https://secureyourit.co.uk/wp/2020/04/18/enumerating-process-modules-in-vba/)
