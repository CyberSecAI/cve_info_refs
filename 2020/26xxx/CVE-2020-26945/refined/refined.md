Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-26945:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the unsafe deserialization of object streams within MyBatis's 2nd-level cache implementation. Specifically, if a user enables the built-in 2nd-level cache without setting up a JEP-290 filter, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the private `Map` field (`org.apache.ibatis.cache.impl.PerpetualCache.cache`) with a crafted, malicious serialized object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The core vulnerability lies in the deserialization of Java objects without proper filtering or validation. This allows for arbitrary code execution by injecting malicious serialized objects.
- **Lack of JEP-290 Filter:** The absence of a JEP-290 filter, which is designed to control the classes that can be deserialized, exacerbates the issue.
- **Modifiable Cache Entries:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by finding a way to modify entries of the private `Map` field in the cache.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation can lead to RCE, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the MyBatis application. This could enable complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cache Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves finding a way to modify the contents of the MyBatis cache. This could be done via:
    - Modifying the entries within the `org.apache.ibatis.cache.impl.PerpetualCache.cache` Map via an intermediary.
    - Other vulnerabilities that could be exploited in conjunction with this vulnerability to manipulate cached objects.
- **Abuse of Object Deserialization:** The attacker crafts a malicious serialized Java object that, upon deserialization, triggers the execution of arbitrary code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Modify Cache:** The attacker needs to find a way to modify the cache entries, which may require:
    - Network access to intercept cache updates.
    - Local file system access if the cache is persisted.
    - Another vulnerability that allows for the manipulation of cache entries.
- **Knowledge of Target Application:** A certain level of knowledge of the target application's use of MyBatis' caching mechanisms is required to successfully exploit this vulnerability.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker must be able to craft malicious serialized Java objects that, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this issue involves adding a warning message when deserialization is performed without a JEP-290 filter and recommends setting up a whitelist approach to protect the application.
- The suggested mitigation is to define a JEP-290 serial filter with a whitelist to control the classes allowed for deserialization.
- The vulnerability affects MyBatis versions prior to 3.5.6.
