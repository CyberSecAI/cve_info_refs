  "CVE-2020-26870": {
    "Description": "Two issues have been found in dompurify.js, an XSS sanitizer for HTML, MathML and SVG. Both issues are related to mXSS issues in SVG- or MATH-elements.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a mutation XSS (mXSS) issue that arises from the way DOMPurify handles nested form elements combined with specific MathML elements.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of nested HTML form elements.",
      "Incorrect namespace handling for mglyph elements within MathML text integration points.",
      "DOM mutation due to re-parsing serialized HTML."
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. An attacker can inject malicious code that bypasses the sanitization and executes in the victim's browser.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects a crafted HTML payload containing nested form elements, MathML elements (`<math>`, `<mtext>`), a `<mglyph>` element, a `<style>` tag, and an HTML element with an event handler such as `<img>` with `onerror`. ",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious payload into a location that is processed by the vulnerable DOMPurify instance. This typically involves user-supplied content being sanitized and rendered on a webpage."
