Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-26166:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of file descriptions within the qdPM project management software. Specifically, the application fails to validate the `attachments info` parameter during file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is a stored XSS vulnerability. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the file description field. This code is then stored and executed when other users view the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a user's browser session when they view the injected content.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive user data, including cookies and session tokens.
*   **Account Takeover:** With stolen credentials, attackers can perform actions on behalf of the victimized user.
*   **Malware Delivery:** It is also possible for attackers to redirect users to malicious sites or install malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attack is performed remotely, needing no local system access.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the qdPM application, possessing standard user rights.
*   **File Upload:** The attack is triggered during the file upload process. Specifically, an attacker uploads a file.
*   **Malicious File Description:** The attacker modifies the file's description field to include malicious JavaScript or HTML code (e.g., `<svg/onload=alert("Attachment info XSS")>`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid account on the qdPM application.
*   The attacker must be able to upload files within the application (specifically, when creating a ticket, project, or task).
*   The attacker must be able to modify the file description.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in version 9.1 of qdPM.
*   The vulnerability affects the file upload functionality when creating tickets, projects, or tasks.
*   The provided content indicates that qdPM version 9.3 addresses an issue with PHP 8.1, but it does not mention a specific fix for this vulnerability.
