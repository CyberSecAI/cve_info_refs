{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Path traversal vulnerability in nuget metadata extraction.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `UpdatePackageFromMetadataService` extracts package and file names based on metadata from the `nuspec` file without proper validation.",
      "The extracted 'id' and 'version' fields are not checked for path traversal sequences."
    ],
    "impact": "Allows an attacker to move the `package.nupkg` file to any location accessible to the `git` user on the server. This can potentially overwrite existing files or create new ones in arbitrary locations. Also parent directories are created if they don't exist.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Craft a malicious `nuspec` file with path traversal sequences in the 'id' and 'version' fields.",
       "Zip this `nuspec` file into a valid nuget package.",
       "Upload the crafted package to the GitLab API."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to upload packages to a GitLab instance and have knowledge of the GitLab API."
