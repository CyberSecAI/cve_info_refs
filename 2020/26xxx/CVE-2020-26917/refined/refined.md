This document describes a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router and extender models.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they access the administrative interface of the affected device. This can lead to session hijacking, information theft, or defacement of the device's management interface.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious script into a field that is stored on the device and later displayed to other users accessing the device's web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to modify a field in the device's configuration that is later displayed without sanitization. This typically requires administrative access to the device, at least initially. The CVSS vector shows that high privileges (PR:H) are required for the initial attack. User interaction (UI:R) is also needed.

The document also provides a list of affected devices and firmware versions, and instructions for updating the firmware to remediate the vulnerability. The affected models are:
* EX7000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.78
* R6250, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.34
* R6400, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.46
* R6400v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.66
* R7100LG, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.50
* R7300DST, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.70
* R7900, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.8
* R8300, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.128
* R8500, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.128

The CVSS v3 score is 4.1 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L indicating:

- Attack Vector (AV): Adjacent Network
- Attack Complexity (AC): Low
- Privileges Required (PR): High
- User Interaction (UI): Required
- Scope (S): Unchanged
- Confidentiality Impact (C): Low
- Integrity Impact (I): Low
- Availability Impact (A): Low
