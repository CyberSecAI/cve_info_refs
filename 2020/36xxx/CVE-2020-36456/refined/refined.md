- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `CopyCell<T>` type in the `toolshed` crate implements the `Send` trait without requiring the contained type `T` to be `Send`. This allows non-thread-safe types to be shared across threads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a missing bound on the `Send` trait for `CopyCell<T>`.  Specifically, the `CopyCell` allows any `Copy` type to be used with `Send`, even though some `Copy` types are not `Send` (e.g. references to types with interior mutability like `Cell`).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Data races can occur when non-thread-safe `Copy` types, such as references to `Cell` are sent to other threads via `CopyCell`. This can lead to memory corruption and unpredictable program behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the use of the `CopyCell` type to send non-thread-safe types (e.g. references to `Cell`) across thread boundaries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to control the types used with `CopyCell` and be able to execute code in multiple threads to exploit the race condition. No special privileges or user interaction are needed.
