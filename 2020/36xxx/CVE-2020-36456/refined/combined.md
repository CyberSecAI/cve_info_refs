### Description

`CopyCell<T>` is a `Cell`-like type that is implemented for any type `T` that
is `Copy`able. It's `Send` trait has no bounds on the contained type.

As not all `Copy`able types are thread safe, for example non-mutable references
implement the `Copy` trait, it is possible to send references to types with
interior mutability such as `Cell` across threads and cause data races.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Nov 15, 2020](https://github.com/ratel-rust/toolshed/issues/12#issue-743200397)

Hi there, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are scanning crates on crates.io for potential soundness bugs. We noticed that the `CopyCell` object implements `Send` as long as the underlying type implements `Copy`.

However, one potential problem with this is that (non-mutable) references actually implement the `Copy` trait: <https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html#impl-Copy-71>

This makes it possible, for example, to share `Cell`s across threads by wrapping them in a `CopyCell`:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use toolshed::CopyCell;

use std::cell::Cell;
use crossbeam_utils::thread;

fn main() {
    let cell = Cell::new(42);
    let copy_cell = CopyCell::new(&cell);

    thread::scope(|s| {
        s.spawn(move |_| {
            let smuggled_cell_ref = copy_cell.get();
            println!("Other Thread: {:p}", smuggled_cell_ref);
        });

        println!("Main Thread:  {:p}", &cell);
    });
}
```

Output:

```
Main Thread:  0x7ffe19babd1c
Other Thread: 0x7ffe19babd1c

```

Indicating that the same `Cell` is now usable across threads, potentially allowing for data races.
