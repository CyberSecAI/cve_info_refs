Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36560:

**Vulnerability:** Path Traversal (Zip Slip)

**Root Cause:** Improper path sanitization when extracting files from a ZIP archive. The `go-unzip` library failed to validate file paths within the archive, allowing specially crafted archives to write files to arbitrary locations outside the intended destination directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Directory Traversal:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of file paths extracted from the zip archive. This allows an attacker to include ".." sequences in the filenames, causing the extraction process to write files outside the intended target directory.
*   **Insufficient Sanitization:** The library did not sanitize the file paths before joining them with the destination directory, thus failing to prevent directory traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:**  An attacker can overwrite existing files on the system by creating malicious zip files with paths containing directory traversal sequences.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By overwriting executable files, attackers can potentially achieve remote command execution when these files are later executed by the system or a user.
*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Overwriting configuration or other sensitive files could cause application malfunction or compromise system integrity.
*   **Client and Server impact:** The vulnerability affects both client machines and servers.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious ZIP Archive:** An attacker creates a crafted ZIP archive containing files with pathnames that include directory traversal sequences like `../`.
*   **Extraction Process:** The vulnerable `go-unzip` library extracts files without properly validating the file paths, allowing files to be written to arbitrary locations based on the malicious paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted ZIP archive to an application that uses the vulnerable `go-unzip` library.
*   The attacker doesn't require any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is also known as "Zip Slip".
*   The fix for the vulnerability involves sanitizing the file paths before writing them to the file system. The fix implemented in commit `4975cbe` checks if the extracted path starts with the cleaned destination path.
*   The vulnerability was present in versions of `go-unzip` prior to 2.0.0
*   CVSS score of 9.1 indicates a critical severity due to high impact on integrity and availability.
