Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-36198

**Vulnerability:** Command Injection Privilege Escalation

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Malware Remover application of QNAP NAS devices.
- A crafted TAR file, placed in the file system, can trigger the execution of a system call.
- This system call is composed using a string provided by the user, allowing for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unsanitized user input: The Malware Remover application does not properly sanitize the user-provided string, leading to the ability to inject arbitrary commands.
- Command injection: The application directly uses a user-controlled string to construct a system call, a classic command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate their privileges to that of the admin user.
- Arbitrary code execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary code with admin privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: Attackers require local access to the QNAP NAS device.
- Crafted TAR file: A specially crafted TAR file needs to be present within the file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the QNAP NAS. This is noted as requiring "Authentication...to exploit this vulnerability".
- File system access: The attacker needs to be able to place the crafted TAR file on the NAS file system.
