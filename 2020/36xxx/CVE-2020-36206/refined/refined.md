Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36206:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `rusb` crate's `Device` and `DeviceHandle` structs implemented `Send` and `Sync` traits for all types `T` that implement the `UsbContext` trait. However, the `UsbContext` trait itself did not have `Send` or `Sync` bounds. This allowed users to implement `UsbContext` with a non-thread-safe type, which could then be used concurrently through `Device` or `DeviceHandle`, leading to data races and memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing `Send` and `Sync` bounds:** The core issue was the absence of `Send` and `Sync` trait bounds on the `UsbContext` trait. This allowed for the possibility of non-thread-safe implementations to be used where thread safety was expected.
*   **Unsafe `Send` and `Sync` implementations:**  The `unsafe impl Send for Device<T> {}` and `unsafe impl Sync for Device<T> {}` declarations, along with similar declarations for `DeviceHandle`, incorrectly assumed that all types implementing `UsbContext` would also be thread-safe, which is not the case.
*   **Data Races:** Using a non-thread-safe `UsbContext` in a multi-threaded context through `Device` or `DeviceHandle` could lead to data races.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The primary impact of the vulnerability is potential memory corruption due to data races. This can lead to unpredictable program behavior, including crashes and potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Unpredictable Behavior:** Data races can cause unexpected and hard-to-debug behavior in applications using `rusb`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the same machine where the vulnerable application runs. This is because `rusb` typically interfaces directly with hardware.
*  **Multi-threading:** The vulnerability requires that the `Device` or `DeviceHandle` is used across threads concurrently with a non-thread safe `UsbContext` implementation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges on the target machine.
*   **Code Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to run their own code that interacts with the `rusb` library.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to understand that the program is using a custom `UsbContext` that isn't thread-safe, and that the `rusb` code allows this.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is categorized as "Unsound" rather than a typical security vulnerability because it is a flaw in the type system which can cause undefined behavior, rather than an exploitable vulnerability in the classic sense.
*   The fix involves adding `Send` and `Sync` bounds to the `UsbContext` trait, ensuring only thread-safe implementations of `UsbContext` can be used with `Device` and `DeviceHandle`.
* The issue was fixed in version `0.7.0`

The CVSS score of 7.0/HIGH reflects the potential for serious consequences including data corruption, and a risk of confidentiality, integrity, and availability being compromised due to the memory corruption. The high attack complexity is related to the fact that the user needs to provide a custom implementation of UsbContext that is not thread-safe.
