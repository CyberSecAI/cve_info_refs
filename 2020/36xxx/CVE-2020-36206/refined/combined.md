Hello fellow Rustacean,

we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) found a memory-safety/soundness issue in this crate while scanning Rust code on crates.io for potential vulnerabilities.

## Issue Description

[rusb/src/device.rs](https://github.com/a1ien/rusb/blob/12ee91dd081428c610d3ccb5bba422198beee084/src/device.rs#L34-L35)

Lines 34 to 35
in
[12ee91d](/a1ien/rusb/commit/12ee91dd081428c610d3ccb5bba422198beee084)

|  | unsafe impl<T: UsbContext> Send for Device<T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<T: UsbContext> Sync for Device<T> {} |

[rusb/src/device\_handle.rs](https://github.com/a1ien/rusb/blob/12ee91dd081428c610d3ccb5bba422198beee084/src/device_handle.rs#L127-L128)

Lines 127 to 128
in
[12ee91d](/a1ien/rusb/commit/12ee91dd081428c610d3ccb5bba422198beee084)

|  | unsafe impl<T: UsbContext> Send for DeviceHandle<T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<T: UsbContext> Sync for DeviceHandle<T> {} |

`Device` and `DeviceHandle` implement `Send` and `Sync` trait for all `T` types that implement `UsbContext`. `UsbContext` trait has neither `Send` nor `Sync` bound and can be implemented from the user side. This permits writing a custom non-thread safe `UsbContext` implementation in safe Rust code, which can cause a data race when used with `Device` or `DeviceHandle`.

If `UsbContext` is not expected to be implemented by users, making `UsbContext` [a sealed trait](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/future-proofing.html#sealed-traits-protect-against-downstream-implementations-c-sealed) can solve this problem. Otherwise, a proper bound should be added to Send/Sync implementations of `Device` and `DeviceHandle` (`<T: Send/Sync + UsbContext>`) or to the definition of `UsbContext` (`UsbContext: Send + Sync`).

### Description

Affected versions of `rusb` did not require `UsbContext` to implement `Send`
and `Sync`. However, through `Device` and `DeviceHandle` it is possible to use
`UsbContext`s across threads.

This issue allows non-thread safe `UsbContext` types to be used concurrently
leading to data races and memory corruption.

The issue was fixed by adding `Send` and `Sync` bounds to `UsbContext`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
