Screenshot proving that injection has occurred:

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51540538/102945707-4bf78900-449d-11eb-8e55-1aed28c07db0.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51540538/102945707-4bf78900-449d-11eb-8e55-1aed28c07db0.png)

Note that port 43 in error and port in prototype are same

This pull request is to prevent tentatives of prototype pollution

## How to reproduce:

```
whois.lookup("__proto__", (err, data) => console.log(data))
const obj = {}
console.log(obj.__proto__)
// [Object: null prototype] { port: 43, query: '$addr\r\n' }
```

Sorry, something went wrong.
