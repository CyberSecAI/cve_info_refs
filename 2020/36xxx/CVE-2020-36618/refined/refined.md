Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a prototype pollution issue in the `node-whois` library.  The `lookup` function was vulnerable to property injection when the input `addr` was `__proto__`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Prototype Pollution: The code did not properly sanitize or validate the input `addr` in the `lookup` function, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the `__proto__` object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By injecting properties into the prototype, an attacker could potentially alter the behavior of all objects created using the affected prototype. This could lead to various security issues, including but not limited to: denial of service, code execution, or modification of application logic.
- The provided code shows that the attacker was able to inject a `port` and `query` property to the prototype of the `obj` object.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing the string `__proto__` as the address in the `whois.lookup()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `whois.lookup()` function. This is likely a client-side attack since the `node-whois` library is primarily used on the server side. However, this library is used to fetch the WHOIS information, so a server-side attack is still a possibility if the library is used to process user input.
