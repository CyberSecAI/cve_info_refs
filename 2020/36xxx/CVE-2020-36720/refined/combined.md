# WordPress Kali Forms plugin fixed multiple vulnerabilities.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [August 21, 2020 - 4:57pm [+0700]January 21, 2021 - 6:16pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-kali-forms-plugin-fixed-multiple-vulnerabilities/)

The WordPress [Kali Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/kali-forms/) plugin (30,000+ active installations) fixed multiple vulnerabilities. Affected versions are 2.1.0 and below and, to some extend, version 2.1.1 (see [Timeline](#timeline) below for more details).

### Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post Deletion

In the “kali-forms/Inc/Frontend/class-form-processor.php” script L91-92, the plugin registers the `kaliforms_form_delete_uploaded_file` AJAX action to call the “delete\_file” function, and makes it accessible to all users, authenticated or not:

```

add_action('wp_ajax_kaliforms_form_delete_uploaded_file', [$this, 'delete_file']);
add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_kaliforms_form_delete_uploaded_file', [$this, 'delete_file']);

```

The function is located in the “kali-forms/Inc/Utils/class-filemanager.php” L138:

```

public function delete_file()
{
   $_POST['id'] = absint(wp_unslash($_POST['id']));
   return wp_delete_post($_POST['id'], true);
}

```

It takes the value of `$_POST['id']` and calls the wp\_delete\_post function.

An unauthenticated user can delete every page and post on the blog.

### Authenticated Options Change

In the “/kali-forms/Inc/Backend/class-hooks.php” script L63, the plugin registers the `kaliforms_update_option_ajax` AJAX action to call the “update\_option” function and makes it accessible to authenticated users:

```

add_action('wp_ajax_kaliforms_update_option_ajax',
   [$this, 'update_option']
);

```

The “update\_option” function is located in the same script L125:

```

public function update_option()
{
   if (isset($_POST['args'], $_POST['args']['nonce'])
      && !wp_verify_nonce(sanitize_key(wp_unslash($_POST['args']['nonce'])), $this->slug . '_nonce')) {
   	wp_die(wp_json_encode([
   	   'success' => false,
   	   'message' => esc_html__('Denied', 'kaliforms'),
   	]));
   }

   $args = stripslashes_deep($_POST['args']);
   $args['method'] === 'delete'
   ? delete_option($this->slug . '_' . $args['option']['key'])
   : update_option($this->slug . '_' . $args['option']['key'], sanitize_text_field($args['option']['value']));

   wp_die(wp_json_encode([
      'success' => true,
      'message' => 'ok - updated option: ' . $args['option']['key'] . ' with the value: ' . $args['option']['value'],
   ]));
}

```

It lacks a capability check and the security nonce can be bypassed because the `$_POST['args']['nonce']` input is only checked if it is set.

An authenticated user can change (or delete) the plugin’s settings. For instance, by modifying the SMTP server credentials settings (e.g., `kaliforms_smtp_provider`, `kaliforms_smtp_host`, `kaliforms_smtp_username`, `kaliforms_smtp_password` etc), all submitted form data will be redirected to the attacker’s mailbox/SMTP server.

### CSRF

Throughout the plugin’s code, security nonces can be bypassed because they are only checked if they are set:

-https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/kali-forms/tags/2.1.0/Inc/Frontend/class-form-processor.php#L242

-https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/kali-forms/tags/2.1.0/Inc/Frontend/class-form-processor.php#L655

-https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/kali-forms/tags/2.1.0/Inc/Backend/class-form-styles.php#L75

-https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/kali-forms/tags/2.1.0/Inc/Backend/class-plugin-health-checks.php#L216

-https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/kali-forms/tags/2.1.0/Inc/Backend/class-plugin-review.php#L156

-https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/kali-forms/tags/2.1.0/Inc/Backend/class-hooks.php#L152

-https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/kali-forms/tags/2.1.0/Inc/Backend/class-predefined-forms.php#L44

-https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/kali-forms/tags/2.1.0/Inc/Backend/class-plugin-deactivation.php#L96

-https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/kali-forms/tags/2.1.0/Inc/Backend/class-notifications.php#L107

### Additional Issues

In the “kali-forms/Inc/Backend/class-hooks.php”, the “clear\_mail\_log” function L150 is loaded by the `kaliforms_clear_log` AJAX action L66. There’s no capability check, any authenticated user can delete the plugin’s log.

### Timeline

The vulnerabilities were reported to the wordpress.org plugins team on August 7th, 2020 and a new version 2.1.1 was released on August 15th. However, because that version introduced two new vulnerabilities, version 2.1.2 was released on August 17th, 2020.

### Recommendations

Upgrade immediately if you have version 2.1.1 or below. If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.

I’ve been testing Kali Forms for a few months now and it works great. It’s easy to set up. My experience is based on the free version.

I use it on a lot of sites. Creation is very intuitive, and it has some cool features in the ProVersion, some others might miss (signature field)Special mention: the solid honeypot option is very good. I never needed a captcha here.
