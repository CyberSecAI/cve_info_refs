Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability fixed by commit `bb33d4325fba80e7ea68b79121dba025caf6f45f`:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application was setting a cookie (`newudid`) without the `httpOnly` and `secure` flags, and was also vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the `/enrollment` route.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Missing `httpOnly` flag on cookie:**  The `newudid` cookie was being set without the `httpOnly` flag. This makes the cookie accessible to client-side JavaScript, allowing potential attackers to steal it through XSS attacks.
2.  **Missing `secure` flag on cookie:** The `newudid` cookie was also not set with the `secure` flag.  This means that the cookie could be sent over unencrypted HTTP connections, making it vulnerable to interception.
3.  **XSS Vulnerability in `/enrollment`:** The `/enrollment` route was vulnerable to XSS attacks. It would render the cookie value directly on the page, allowing malicious code to be injected through the cookie.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **Cookie theft:** An attacker could potentially steal the `newudid` cookie through client-side JavaScript if they manage to inject malicious code on the vulnerable page.
2.  **Session Hijacking:** If the cookie is used for authentication or authorization, an attacker could use the stolen cookie to impersonate a legitimate user.
3.  **XSS Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page when a user views the `/enrollment` route with a crafted `newudid` cookie.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **XSS Attack:** An attacker could inject malicious Javascript into the `newudid` cookie, which would then be executed when the `/enrollment` page is rendered.
2.  **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker could intercept the cookie when transmitted over an unencrypted HTTP connection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  For XSS, the attacker would need to find a way to set the `newudid` cookie to a malicious value, which is then displayed on the page
2.  For cookie theft via MITM, the attacker would need to be in a position to intercept the unencrypted HTTP traffic of a user visiting the site.

**Fix:**

The commit addresses these issues with the following fixes:
1.  The `httpOnly` flag is added to the `newudid` cookie, preventing client-side JavaScript access.
2.  The `secure` flag is added to the `newudid` cookie to ensure the cookie is only sent over HTTPS in production.
3.  The code now renders the cookie value safely in the HTML, preventing XSS vulnerabilities.
