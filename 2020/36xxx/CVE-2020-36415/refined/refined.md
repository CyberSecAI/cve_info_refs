The provided content describes multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in CMS Made Simple version 2.2.14.

**Root Cause:** The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input before rendering it in the web interface. Specifically, the application fails to properly encode HTML entities, allowing malicious users to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored XSS:** In several instances, user input is stored in the database and later displayed without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed each time a user views the affected content or setting. Specific locations include:
    *   "Manage Shortcuts" feature
    *   "Categories" via "Settings - New Module"
    *   "Options" via "Settings - New Module"
    *   "Content Editing Settings" via "Settings - Global Settings"
    *   "Admin Search" via "Extensions"
    *   "Maintenance Mode" via "Settings - Global Settings"
    *   "News" via "Content" (specifically the "Extra" field).
*   **Reflected XSS:** In two instances within the "Design Manager" via "Layout" feature, the vulnerability is reflected, meaning the malicious script is executed due to the unsanitized input in the current request.
    *   Creating a new stylesheet
    *   Creating a new design

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking by stealing cookies or other session information.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An authenticated malicious user is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker crafts malicious payloads containing JavaScript code and injects it into specific input fields in the admin panel. These input fields vary based on the vulnerability:
    *   "Title" in "Manage Shortcuts"
    *   "Name" or "Parent" in "Categories"
    *   "Email address to receive notification of news submission:" or "The Subject of the outgoing email:" in "Options"
    *   "Path for the {page_image} tag:", "Path for thumbnail field:", or "Path for {content_image} tag:" in "Content Editing Settings"
    *   "Search Text" in "Admin Search"
    *   "Exclude these IP addresses from the 'Site Down' status" in "Maintenance Mode"
    *    "URL (slug)" or "Extra" in "News" (only "Extra" is fixed)
    *   "*Name" in "Create a new Stylesheet"
    *  "*Name" in "Create a new Design"

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the administrative panel of the CMS Made Simple instance. This means they need valid login credentials for the CMS.

**Additional Notes:**
* The report indicates that some of the reported vulnerabilities were fixed in later versions, specifically items 2, 3, 4, 6, and the "Extra" field in item 7.
* The "URL (slug)" field in item 7, and items 1, 8, and 9 are marked as "won't fix," as the maintainers determined they primarily affect the user who exploits them. However, it is important to note that even self-XSS can be used for malicious purposes.
* The maintainers also stated that item 5 could not be reproduced.
