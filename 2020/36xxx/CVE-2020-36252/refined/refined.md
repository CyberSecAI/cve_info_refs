- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect use of privileged APIs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An authenticated attacker can access all versions of all files (even unshared) as soon as the owner of said files has at least one outgoing share with the attacker. The attacker needs to guess a file-id which is numeric and sequential.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to all file versions, including unshared files of a user.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated user with at least one outgoing share with the targeted user can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user within the ownCloud system and must have at least one share with the target user. The attacker also needs to guess file IDs, which are numeric and sequential.
