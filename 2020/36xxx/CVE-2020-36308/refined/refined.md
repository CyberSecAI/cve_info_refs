Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-36308

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Redmine handles time entries when exporting them to a CSV file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows the export of time entries via CSV to disclose subjects of issues that the user performing the export does not have the necessary permissions to view. This means a user could potentially learn about issues that are otherwise hidden from them based on their roles and permissions in Redmine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** Attackers could use this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information about issues that they are not supposed to see.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with the ability to export time entries could trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be a Redmine user with the permission to export time entries. This is usually a privilege granted to specific user roles within the system. The attacker does not need any special permissions beyond the export of time entries.
