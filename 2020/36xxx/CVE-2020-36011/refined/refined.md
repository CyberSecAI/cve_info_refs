Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** The provided content does not mention CVE-2020-36011. This information is about a stored XSS vulnerability in Smart Hospital 3.1, which has no CVE ID assigned.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "Add Patient" functionality of the Smart Hospital 3.1 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user input in several fields including "Name", "Guardian Name", "Email", "Address", "Remarks" and "Any Known Allergies" when adding a new patient. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored in the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- When a user views the patient's profile, the stored JavaScript payload will execute in the user's browser.
- This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking: attacker could steal user cookies/session IDs.
    - Account takeover: attacker could modify the patient data.
    - Defacement: attacker could alter the content of the page.
    - Phishing: attacker could redirect the user to a malicious page.
    - Stealing of sensitive information.
    - Further malicious activity within the application on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Add Patient" feature in the application.
- The attacker injects a malicious script within the various text fields while adding a new patient record.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid login credentials as a Super Admin to access the vulnerable "Add Patient" functionality.
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious JavaScript payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit details provide a clear step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the vulnerability using the provided payload.
- The vulnerable fields include name, guardian name, email, address, remarks, and any known allergies.
- The application does not sanitize input before storing it in the database, thus enabling stored XSS.

**Summary:**
The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in Smart Hospital 3.1 application. The application fails to properly sanitize user input allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, which is later executed in the browser of other users when they view the affected records. This leads to a variety of potential attacks such as account takeover or stealing sensitive information.
