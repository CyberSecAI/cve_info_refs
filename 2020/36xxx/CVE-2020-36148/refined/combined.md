## Description

![@cve-reporting](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36542150?v=4&size=48)[cve-reporting](https://github.com/cve-reporting)opened [on Aug 26, 2020](https://github.com/hoene/libmysofa/issues/138#issue-686437740)

Opening maliciously crafted file with mysofa\_open leads to crash of the application.

NULL pointer dereference in verifyAttribute (tools.c:26) on variable attr->value causes segmentation fault.

Message from gdb:

> Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
