Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36148:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of input data within the `verifyAttribute` function of the `libmysofa` library. Specifically, the code attempts to access `attr->value` without ensuring that `attr` and its members are valid. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference when processing a maliciously crafted SOFA file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is a NULL pointer dereference in `tools.c:26` due to improper validation of the attribute pointer (`attr`) and its `value` member before dereferencing it.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted file, indicating a weakness in input validation. The software doesn't properly check if required pointers are valid or not-null before accessing their members.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Application Crash:** Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault and subsequent crash of the application using `libmysofa`.
- **Denial of Service:** Repeated crashes can result in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously Crafted SOFA Files:** The primary attack vector is through the use of specially crafted SOFA files, which are then processed by the vulnerable `libmysofa` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted SOFA file to an application that uses the vulnerable `libmysofa` library.
- **No Specific Privilege:** No elevated privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability by providing a malicious input file, however, the impact is limited to the application using the vulnerable library, therefore, the attacker is limited to the permissions of the user running the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SOFA File Format:** The attacker needs to have a degree of understanding of the SOFA file format to be able to craft files that trigger the vulnerability, although the linked github issue provides an example file to trigger this.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided GitHub issue ([https://github.com/hoene/libmysofa/issues/138](https://github.com/hoene/libmysofa/issues/138)) includes a crash dump, the relevant code snippet that causes the crash and a zipped file demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by a call to `mysofa_open` in the sample code when provided with a crafted SOFA file, which then calls `verifyAttribute` internally.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves upgrading to `libmysofa` version 1.2.
*   The Red Hat bugzilla entries ([https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1928833](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1928833), [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1928834](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1928834)) confirms the vulnerability and tracks the fix in Fedora and EPEL distributions.
*  The fedora mailing list confirms that the vulnerability was fixed in libmysofa version 1.2-4.fc32 and was backported to libmysofa-1.2-4.el7 and libmysofa-1.2-4.el8.
