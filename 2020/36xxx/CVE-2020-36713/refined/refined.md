Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The MStore API plugin for WordPress exposed two REST API endpoints, `register` and `update_user_profile`, without proper authentication checks. These endpoints were accessible to any user, regardless of their login status.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unauthenticated Account Creation:** The `register` endpoint allowed any user to create a new account on the WordPress site, and also permitted them to specify the user role, including 'administrator'.
*   **Unauthenticated User Profile Modification:** The `update_user_profile` endpoint allowed any user to modify the profile of any other user on the site, without authentication or authorization checks, such as changing the administrator's password.
*   **Missing Access Controls:**  The plugin failed to check if the user was authenticated and authorized to perform these operations.
*   **Use of Deprecated JSON API Plugin:** The plugin also registered custom endpoints via the deprecated JSON API plugin, which has known security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could create a new administrator account on the WordPress site, gaining full control.
*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker could modify existing user accounts, including the administrator account, potentially changing the password and locking out legitimate users.
*   **Complete Site Compromise:** With administrator access, an attacker can do anything on the WordPress site, like install malicious plugins, upload backdoors, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via HTTP requests to the vulnerable REST API endpoints.
*   **REST API:** The plugin's custom REST API endpoints were the direct attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid user account. They can be completely unauthenticated.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to send POST requests to the specified API endpoints with required parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in version 2.1.5 and below of the MStore API plugin.
*   The `register` method generates and returns authentication cookies for the newly created administrator account, facilitating immediate access without needing to log in.
*   The blog post mentions that the plugin was also vulnerable through endpoints exposed via the deprecated JSON API plugin, if that plugin is enabled, with the only difference being that the `register` function requires that the `user_can_register` option be enabled.
*   The vulnerability was reported on February 19, 2020, and a fix (version 2.1.6) was released on February 21, 2020.
