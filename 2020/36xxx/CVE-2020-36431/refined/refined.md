Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36431:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is described as an "UNKNOWN WRITE" in `helper_wfe_arm`. The provided information doesn't specify the exact cause, but it highlights a memory corruption issue due to an unknown write operation. The crash occurred within the `helper_wfe_arm` function in the Unicorn emulator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unknown Write:** A memory corruption vulnerability occurs when an unknown or invalid memory write is performed in the `helper_wfe_arm` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The primary impact is a crash of the application using the vulnerable Unicorn emulator, specifically triggered during a call to the `helper_wfe_arm` function
- **Potential Memory Corruption**: The "unknown write" suggests a more severe issue than a mere crash, as it could lead to arbitrary memory corruption if the location of the write is controllable or deterministic. The impact can extend to code execution or other forms of exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering the `helper_wfe_arm` function within a program using the vulnerable version of the Unicorn emulator. This likely involves crafting a specific input or program state to cause the problematic write.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to control input or execution flow of the program being executed by the Unicorn emulator to reach the code path where `helper_wfe_arm` function is called with conditions triggering the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found by OSS-Fuzz and reported on the Chromium bug tracker (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=20245).
