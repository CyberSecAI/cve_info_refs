The provided content describes multiple non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in DedeCMS v5.7 SP2 (UTF8), not v7.5 as indicated by the document title.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding for several parameters in different PHP files. This allows injection of malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in the `filename`, `mid`, `userid`, and `templet` parameters of the following files:
    - `tpl.php`
    - `mychannel_edit.php`
    - `file_manage_view.php`
    - `sys_admin_user_edit.php`
    - `makehtml_homepage.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Non-persistent phishing attacks
- Non-persistent external redirects to malicious sources
- Non-persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is non-persistent and client-side.
- Attackers can inject malicious script code through GET requests to the vulnerable parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability.
- No privileges or session are required to exploit it.
- Low user interaction is required (the user needs to click a crafted link).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by injecting code into the URL parameters. For example: `https://test23.localhost:8080/dede/tpl.php?acdir=default&action=edit&filename="><script>alert(1)</script>`
- The vulnerability is present in DedeCMS v5.7 SP2 (UTF8).
- The provided examples use simple payloads to demonstrate the vulnerability.

**Note:**
The document mentions DedeCMS v5.7 SP2 while the document title states v7.5 SP2. The content of the document specifically discusses vulnerabilities in version 5.7, making it inconsistent with the document title. Since the CVE description is a placeholder, it cannot be verified for accuracy. However, based on the content, the described vulnerabilities are not related to DedeCMS v7.5 SP2.
