The provided content relates to CVE-2020-36371.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stack overflow caused by excessive recursion in the mjs JavaScript engine's parser. The parser's recursive functions for handling expressions can call each other repeatedly, consuming stack space until a stack overflow occurs. Specifically, functions like `parse_unary`, `parse_mul_div_rem`, `parse_plus_minus`, and others in the expression parsing hierarchy are involved in the recursion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - **Unbounded Recursion:** The parser does not have sufficient safeguards or limits on the depth of recursion when handling complex expressions.
  - **Stack Overflow:**  The recursive nature of the parser allows it to exceed the stack's available memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The stack overflow will crash the application or process running the vulnerable mjs engine, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **Crafted JavaScript Input:** A malicious actor can provide specially crafted JavaScript code that triggers the deep recursion in the parser. This code would consist of nested expressions that force the parser to call the vulnerable functions repeatedly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Ability to provide JavaScript code:** The attacker needs to be able to supply JavaScript code to the mjs engine, either directly or indirectly through an application that uses it.
