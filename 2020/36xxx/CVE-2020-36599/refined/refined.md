{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper request method validation in the OmniAuth library. Specifically, the library's default behavior allowed both GET and POST requests to access the `/auth/:provider/callback` endpoint. This becomes a problem when a strategy POSTs during the callback, as this action requires skipping the authenticity token check. Since GET requests are not checked for the token, they could be used to bypass authenticity token protection if they are used in a callback.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of request method validation",
      "Inadequate authenticity token protection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could bypass authenticity token protection, potentially leading to unauthorized actions if the application relies solely on this protection.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a GET request to the callback URL (`/auth/:provider/callback`), an attacker could bypass authenticity token checks that are expected for POST requests, potentially compromising the user's session or performing unauthorized actions.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted GET request to a vulnerable `/auth/:provider/callback` endpoint of an application that uses the OmniAuth library, and knowledge of how the callback mechanism works."
  },
  "affected_component": "omniauth gem",
    "fixed_version": "The commit `43a396f181ef7d0ed2ec8291c939c95e3ed3ff00` addresses this issue by limiting allowed request methods to POST by default. It also introduces an authenticity check for GET request"
