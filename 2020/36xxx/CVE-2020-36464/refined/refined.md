Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36464:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `Clone` implementation of the `IntoIter` for the `heapless::Vec` in versions prior to 0.6.1.  When a `Vec`'s iterator is cloned, the entire underlying `Vec` is cloned, not just the remaining elements. This leads to a use-after-free condition if the original iterator has already consumed some of the elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-after-free:** Cloning a partially consumed iterator results in cloning already-dropped items, leading to a use-after-free condition when the cloned iterator is used.
- **Incorrect `Clone` implementation:**  The `IntoIter::clone` implementation does not consider the current position of the iterator and clones all underlying elements regardless of whether they have been consumed or not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory corruption:**  Accessing freed memory can corrupt the heap or lead to crashes.
- **Denial of service:**  The use-after-free can lead to a program crash, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by creating a `heapless::Vec`, converting it into an iterator, partially consuming the iterator, and then cloning the partially consumed iterator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the program flow and create a scenario where a partially consumed iterator is cloned.
- No specific privileges or user interaction are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.6.1 of the `heapless` crate.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "memory-corruption" and "memory-exposure".
- The CVSS score is 7.5, classified as HIGH, indicating that this is a serious issue.
- The vulnerability is reachable via network with low complexity and no user interaction required.
- The affected function is `heapless::vec::IntoIter::clone`.
- The provided code snippet in the github issue #181 demonstrates the use after free vulnerability and how it can be triggered by using clone on partially consumed iterator.
