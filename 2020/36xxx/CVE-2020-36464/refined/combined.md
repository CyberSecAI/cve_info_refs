# Unsoundness in vec::IntoIter::clone() #181

## Description

![@Dirbaio](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1247578?u=dc2f5410c755cdc2a7e45a8a95b5e78b71e81f81&v=4&size=48)[Dirbaio](https://github.com/Dirbaio)opened [on Nov 2, 2020](https://github.com/rust-embedded/heapless/issues/181#issue-734702341)

`IntoIter`'s Clone implementation clones the entire inner Vec. If the iterator has been partially consumed, only the non-consumed items should be cloned.

The following code demonstrates the issue:

```
use heapless::consts::*;
use heapless::Vec;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Foo {
    n: u32,
}

impl Foo {
    fn new(n: u32) -> Self {
        Self { n }
    }
}

impl Clone for Foo {
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        println!("cloning {:?}", self);
        Self {
            n: self.n,
        }
    }
}

impl Drop for Foo {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Dropping {:?}", self);
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    let mut v: Vec<Foo, U16> = Vec::new();
    v.push(Foo::new(1)).unwrap();
    v.push(Foo::new(2)).unwrap();
    v.push(Foo::new(3)).unwrap();

    let mut i = v.into_iter();

    let item = i.next();
    println!("popped {:?}", item);
    core::mem::drop(item);

    println!("cloning iter");

    let mut j = i.clone();
}
```

This outputs

```
Hello, world!
popped Some(Foo { n: 1 })
Dropping Foo { n: 1 }
cloning iter
cloning Foo { n: 1 }
cloning Foo { n: 2 }
cloning Foo { n: 3 }
Dropping Foo { n: 2 }
Dropping Foo { n: 3 }
Dropping Foo { n: 2 }
Dropping Foo { n: 3 }

```

After `Foo 1` is popped from the iterator, cloning the iterator will still clone the "dead" `Foo 1`. Only `Foo 2` and `Foo 3` should be cloned.

### Description

The `IntoIter` `Clone` implementation clones the whole underlying `Vec`.
If the iterator is partially consumed the consumed items will be copied, thus creating a use-after-free access.

It seems like each `unsafe` block in this crate could be replaced with safe code indexing or slicing the result of `as_ref` or `as_mut`. Is there a reason to prefer the unsafe way?

More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Use-after-free when cloning a partially consumed `Vec` iterator
The `IntoIter` `Clone` implementation clones the whole underlying `Vec`.
If the iterator is partially consumed the consumed items will be copied, thus creating a use-after-free access.
A proof of concept is available in the original bug report.
