  "content": "The provided content primarily discusses security patches for multiple Oracle products and acknowledges security researchers for their contributions. Specifically, the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36183 is mentioned in the context of FasterXML jackson-databind library, affecting multiple Oracle products. However, the technical root cause, impact, and attack vectors for CVE-2020-36183 are not detailed here. There is a reference to an external medium.com link that might contain some detail.\n\nBased on the github.com content, it appears the vulnerability is related to a \"gadget type\" regarding a class of `org.docx4j.org.apache:xalan-interpretive` library. It is fixed in Jackson 2.9.10.8 and 2.6.7.5, but not considered a vulnerability in 2.10.0 or later. It appears that this CVE may be related to insecure deserialization when specific library classes are used with polymorphic type handling in Jackson.\n\nBased on this limited information, and with reference to known vulnerable deserialization issues, we can extract the following:\n\n- Root cause of vulnerability: Insecure deserialization due to mishandling of serialization gadgets and typing in FasterXML jackson-databind library, when using the class `org.docx4j.org.apache:xalan-interpretive` library.\n- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unsafe handling of polymorphic type handling allowing for attacker-controlled class instantiation and method invocation, leveraging a known \"gadget\" class.\n- Impact of exploitation: Information disclosure, data modification, or denial of service. (based on the oracle advisory language - the github page does not provide specific impacts beyond confirming it is a \"gadget\").\n- Attack vectors: Maliciously crafted JSON payloads sent by an attacker to a service that uses jackson-databind and has this specific library dependency on its classpath.\n- Required attacker capabilities/position: Attacker needs to be able to send malicious JSON data to a vulnerable application using Jackson with insecure polymorphic typing configuration and the vulnerable library on the classpath.",
