***Tip:** You can search by CVE ID, software name or slug, or the researcher name. Expand to read about more advanced search options.*

If you want to perform more advanced lookups, you can use **keywords** to further refine your search.

For example, `woocommerce researcher:"chloe chamberland"` would search for any vulnerabilities discovered by Chloe Chamberland in software that has WooCommerce in the title.

Keywords are added in `keyword:value` format. If the value contains spaces, you must enclose it in quotation marks.

You can use the following keywords to add criteria to your search:

title
Searches through the title of each vulnerability for matches.

date
Returns vulnerabilities by publication date. Use `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY` format.

cvss-rating
Use `low`, `medium`, `high` or `critical` to limit the search to vulnerabilities with the specified rating.

researcher
Returns vulnerabilities credited to researchers containing the given text.

software
Returns vulnerabilities discovered in software containing the given text.

software-slug
Returns vulnerabilities discovered in software exactly matching the given slug.

software-type
Use `plugin`, `theme` or `core` to limit the search to the specified type of software.

By selecting “Search” you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the Wordfence Intelligence Terms and Conditions.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Multiple Plugins/Themes - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### Description

NinTechNet discovered multiple WordPress plugins and themes vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

The items only check the CSRF nonce if it has been provided, making them vulnerable to CSRF attacks if the nonce is removed. This is due to the confusing use of logic operators when verifying the nonces.

### Description

The Coming Soon & Maintenance Mode Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.57. This is due to confusing logic functions missing or having incorrect nonce validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to gain and perform otherwise unauthorized access and actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
