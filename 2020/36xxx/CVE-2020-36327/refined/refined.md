{
  "CVE-2020-36327": {
    "Description": "Bundler 1.16.0 through 2.2.9 and 2.2.11 through 2.2.16 sometimes chooses a dependency source based on the highest gem version number, which means that a rogue gem found at a public source may be chosen, even if the intended choice was a private gem that is a dependency of another private gem that is explicitly depended on by the application.",
    "Root cause": "Bundler prioritizes gem versions based on the highest version number, without correctly prioritizing private sources for dependencies of gems explicitly defined in a private source block.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Dependency Confusion",
      "Incorrect source priority resolution"
    ],
    "Impact": "Installation of a malicious gem version and arbitrary code execution if a higher version of a gem with the same name exists in a public repository.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Pushing a gem with the same name but higher version to a public repository."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create and publish a gem to a public repository, and knowledge of private gem names."
  }
