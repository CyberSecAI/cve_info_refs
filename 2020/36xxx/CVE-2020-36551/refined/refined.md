Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the Multi Restaurant Table Reservation System. Specifically, the application does not sanitize user-controlled fields like "Item Name", "Made by" and "food_type" before displaying it on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to persistent XSS attacks, meaning the injected malicious script is stored in the database and executed every time the vulnerable page is loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that can steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information from users who view the affected pages.
- **Account Hijacking:** By stealing session cookies, an attacker can potentially hijack user accounts, including administrator accounts.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker can perform actions on behalf of the victim user, such as making unauthorized changes, deleting data, or redirecting the user to malicious websites.
- **Defacement:** The attacker can alter the content of the vulnerable pages, potentially defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves submitting crafted HTTP POST requests to the `manage-insert.php` endpoint. These requests include malicious JavaScript payloads within the `itemname`, `madeby`, or `food_type` form fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the application.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters/fields.
- No specific authentication is mentioned as being required to submit the form, which suggests the attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, or that any user can trigger the vulnerability.

**Specific Details:**
The provided content details the following persistent XSS vulnerabilities, specifically for CVE-2020-36551:
- **CVE-2020-36551:** Persistent XSS vulnerability at `/dashboard/menu-list.php` triggered by adding a payload in the "Item Name" field in `menu-add.php`. The payload `<script>alert("XSS1")</script>` is used as an example, demonstrating a successful XSS injection.
