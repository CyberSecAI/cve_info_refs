# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Hi there, we (the Rust group at [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are auditing crates on crates.io for safety issues and noticed that the `Shared` object seems to not have bounds on its `Send`/`Sync` traits:

[model/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/spacejam/model/blob/b50d9eef17a80297a45772af4aa8a7413aa66c2c/src/lib.rs#L110-L112)

Lines 110 to 112
in
[b50d9ee](/spacejam/model/commit/b50d9eef17a80297a45772af4aa8a7413aa66c2c)

|  | unsafe impl<T> Sync for Shared<T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | unsafe impl<T> Send for Shared<T> {} |

We weren't sure if this was intentional since this is a testing library but this can be used to create data races from safe Rust by sharing types like `Cell`:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use model::Shared;

use std::cell::Cell;
use crossbeam_utils::thread;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum RefOrInt<'a> { Ref(&'a u64), Int(u64) }

static SOME_INT: u64 = 123;

fn main() {
    let cell = Cell::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
    let shared = Shared::new(&cell);

    thread::scope(|s| {
        s.spawn(move |_| {
            loop {
                // Repeatedly write Ref(&addr) and Int(0xdeadbeef) into the cell.
                shared.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
                shared.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
            }
        });

        loop {
            if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = cell.get() {
                // Hope that between the time we pattern match the object as a
                // `Ref`, it gets written to by the other thread.
                if addr as *const u64 == &SOME_INT as *const u64 {
                    continue;
                }

                // Due to the data race, obtaining Ref(0xdeadbeef) is possible
                println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
                println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
            }
        }
    });
}
```

which outputs:

```
Pointer is now: 0xdeadbeef

Return Code: -11 (SIGSEGV)

```
