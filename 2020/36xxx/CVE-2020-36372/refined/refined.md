{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by excessive recursion in the parser functions of the mjs JavaScript engine.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled recursion",
      "Stack overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A stack overflow occurs when parsing a crafted JavaScript payload, leading to a crash of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted JavaScript payload",
       "Specifically designed to trigger deep recursion during parsing"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to provide crafted input to the mjs JavaScript engine"
    ],
     "additional_information": "The stack trace indicates that the `parse_unary`, `parse_mul_div_rem`, `parse_plus_minus` functions are called recursively, eventually leading to a stack overflow. The provided POC file confirms this issue."
