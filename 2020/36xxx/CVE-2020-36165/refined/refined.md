- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Veritas Desktop and Laptop Option (DLO) attempts to load a non-existent OpenSSL configuration file `openssl.cnf` from `/ReleaseX64/ssl`. Because users can create directories under `C:\` by default on Windows, a low-privileged user can create the directory structure `C:/ReleaseX64/ssl/` and the `openssl.cnf` file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure default file loading, lack of proper file path validation, and insufficient permission checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM, leading to full administrator access on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attack, exploiting the DLO service's attempt to load a configuration file from a user-writable location.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged user account on the Windows system where DLO is installed. No DLO specific privileges are needed.
