Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36246:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Amaze File Manager's improper handling of symbolic links when checking if they point to a file or directory, particularly within directories that require root access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Command Construction:** The application constructs commands by concatenating the parent directory of a symbolic link with the command `ls -l`. This allows injection of arbitrary commands through the symbolic link.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't sanitize the name of the directory or the symbolic link when using them in the `ls -l` command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A non-root application can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges by crafting a malicious symbolic link.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the root user.
- **Data Manipulation/Theft:** The attacker could use the escalated privileges to modify files, steal sensitive information or cause other damage to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Symbolic Links:** The primary attack vector is a malicious symbolic link created by another application without root privileges.
- **File System Manipulation:** An attacker must have the ability to create arbitrary symbolic links within their application's directory.
- **Target Application Interaction:** The attacker relies on the vulnerable application (Amaze File Manager) being used by a user to browse a directory containing the malicious symbolic link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Symbolic Links:** The attacker needs to be able to create symbolic links in their own application directory.
- **No Root Privileges Required Initially:** The attacker does not need root privileges to create the malicious symlink, but they can escalate to root once the user interacts with the vulnerable app.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user of the Amaze File Manager to browse a directory that contains the malicious symbolic link while the application has root access.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory provides a specific example (`ln -s '/`log $(whoami)`/x' evil`) of a malicious symlink that can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
- The advisory explicitly mentions that the vulnerability is locally exploitable and affects versions 3.1.1 to 3.5.0 of Amaze File Manager.
- A patched version (3.5.1) was released to address this issue.
