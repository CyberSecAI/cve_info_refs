#############################################################
Introduction:
-------------
Amaze File Manager is a popular open source, light and smooth file manager for
Android. It also features root explorer for advanced users.
However, the application does not always properly handle files on the file
system. A vulnerability was found that would enable other applications without
root privileges to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the root user.
Affected:
---------
The following Amaze File Manager versions are vulnerable:
- 3.1.1 - 3.5.0
Technical Description:
----------------------
Amaze File Manager checks whether symbolic links found on the file system point
to a file or to a directory. While performing this check within directories
browsable only with root rights, the name of the parent directory of the object
pointed by the link is simply concatenated with 'ls -l' command.
Since another application running on the same Android device without root
privileges can create arbitrary symbolic links in its own application's
directory, this careless handling of symbolic links by Amaze may be abused to
execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. For example, a malicious
application could create an evil symbolic link: ln -s '/`log $(whoami)`/x' evil
Once the directory containing this evil link is opened in Amaze, the 'whoami'
command is executed in the root context and the output can be seen in the logs.
Workaround / Fix:
-----------------
Do not grant root access to Amaze File Manager if a vulnerable version is used.
