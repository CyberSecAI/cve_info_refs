Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36463:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `multiqueue` crate incorrectly implemented the `Send` trait for its queue types (`InnerSend<RW, T>`, `InnerRecv<RW, T>`, `FutInnerSend<RW, T>`, `FutInnerRecv<RW, T>`). This was done unconditionally, regardless of whether the type `T` was actually safe to send between threads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect implementation of the `Send` trait.
- Allowing non-`Send` types to be sent between threads.
- Potential for data races and undefined behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data races can occur when non-Send types are shared between threads.
- Undefined behavior can result from data races. This could lead to crashes, memory corruption, or other unpredictable outcomes.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by any code that utilizes the `multiqueue` crate to send non-`Send` types to another thread.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to influence the type of data being sent through the queue using the vulnerable `multiqueue` crate.
- No special privileges are required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the `multiqueue` crate up to and including 0.3.2.
- No patched versions are available.
- The vulnerability is categorized as both memory corruption and thread-safety issues.
- The CVSS score is 8.1 (High) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating a network-based attack with high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact, though with high complexity.
- The vulnerability is also tracked under aliases: `GHSA-jf43-3v8j-qwwr`, `GHSA-r2x6-vrxx-jgv4`.
- There are references to the issue in the `multiqueue` GitHub repository:  [schets/multiqueue#31](https://github.com/schets/multiqueue/issues/31)
