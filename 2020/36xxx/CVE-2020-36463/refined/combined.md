### Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send` for types used in queue implementations (`InnerSend<RW, T>`, `InnerRecv<RW, T>`, `FutInnerSend<RW, T>`, `FutInnerRecv<RW, T>`).

This allows users to send non-Send types to other threads, which can lead to data race bugs or other undefined behavior.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Hello 🦀 ,

I recently submitted a bug report to the [`multiqueue2`](https://crates.io/crates/multiqueue2/0.1.7) crate which is maintained from a fork of this crate.

The bug was fixed a few days ago in version 0.1.7 of the `mulltiqueue2` crate.

The exact same bug exists for the `multiqueue` crate as well.

FYI, I'll leave a link to the bug report that I submitted for the `multiqueue2` crate: [abbychau#10](https://github.com/abbychau/multiqueue2/issues/10)

Thank you for checking out this issue 👍
