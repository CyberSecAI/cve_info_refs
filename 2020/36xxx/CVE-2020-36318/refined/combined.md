## Description

![@ayourtch](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68104?u=b87288076ad4e97db65c67661f73e003695235ab&v=4&size=48)[ayourtch](https://github.com/ayourtch)opened [on Dec 7, 2020](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79808#issue-758851810)

This is my first bug report, so please correct me s if I miss anything :-)

I use VecDeque in a toy application (<https://github.com/ayourtch/flex-sftp-server>) which is handling external reads in a loop, and does possible partial handling of the input.

My pattern is I call reserve(N) before push\_back() N times, then make\_contiguous(), then doing some pop\_front(). I noticed the app was behaving badly, and was able to generate a stand-alone test case which shows the bug.

The code is pretty boring and repetitive, so I put it at <https://github.com/ayourtch/deq-bug/> to avoid spamming here.

Just issue "cargo run" after cloning out that code, and look for the word "BUG" within the terminal output:

According to the docs, pop\_front() on an empty VecDeque should return None.

Instead, this happens:

```
pop: Some(75)
pop: Some(6e)
pop: Some(74)
pop: Some(75)
deq len: 0
pop: Some(2f)
BUG ^^^
deq len: 31
pop: Some(75)
pop: Some(62)
pop: Some(75)
pop: Some(6e)

```

If I set the boolean "do\_reserve" to be false, thus getting rid of all the reserve() calls, I get the expected behavior:

```
pop: Some(75)
pop: Some(6e)
pop: Some(74)
pop: Some(75)
deq len: 0
pop: None
BUG ^^^
deq len: 0
pop: None
pop: None
pop: None
pop: None
pop: None

```

The same happens if I set "do\_make\_contiguous" to false as well - so calling both functions is a prerequisite to trigger the bug.

The same thing happens in debug and release builds.

### Meta

The below is the version I found it in, but thanks a lot to Steve Klabnik for also testing it on nightly and getting the same buggy behavior.

`rustc --version --verbose`:

this was only a perfomance issue because `is_contiguous` returns false if the `head` is 0

Sorry, something went wrong.

Do you want to write a version of this that uses `Box`es so that we ensure it doesn't segfault?

that shouldn't matter i think. The reason this could segfault is if the result is wrong. But as the used algorithm doesn't depend on `T` asserting that it is correct for `i32` also means that it would be correct for `Box` and therefore can't segfault.
