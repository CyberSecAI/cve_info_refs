Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-36640:

**Vulnerability:** The core issue is related to XXE (XML External Entity) attacks. The provided code diff shows the fix for this vulnerability in the `SecureWSConnector.java` file.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability existed because the `DocumentBuilderFactory` and `TransformerFactory` were not properly configured to prevent the processing of external entities. Specifically, the `ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD` and `ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA` attributes were not set to prevent external access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE vulnerability:** The code was vulnerable to XXE attacks due to the insecure configuration of XML processing factories. An attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious XML payload that includes external entity references, leading to potential information disclosure or denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read local files on the server.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could craft a malicious XML payload to cause the server to consume excessive resources, leading to a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `ENVELOPE` input parameter of the `SecureWSConnector`.
- An attacker would provide a crafted XML string within this parameter, which contains an external entity reference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control the `ENVELOPE` input parameter of the `SecureWSConnector`. This suggests that an authenticated attacker who has the ability to use the connector is required, or possibly an unauthenticated user if the connector was exposed in a way that did not require auth.

**Technical Details from Code Diff:**
- The fix involves setting `XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD` and `XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA` attributes to `""` in the following locations, preventing the processing of external DTDs and schemas:
  - When creating `DocumentBuilderFactory`:
    ```java
    documentBuilderFactory.setAttribute(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "");
    documentBuilderFactory.setAttribute(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_SCHEMA, "");
    ```
  - When creating `TransformerFactory`:
    ```java
    transformerFactory.setAttribute(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "");
    transformerFactory.setAttribute(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_STYLESHEET, "");
   ```

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message `fix(vulnerabilities): fix XXE attacks vulnerabilities and other code smell` and the pull request title `#17 fix(vulnerabilities): fix XXE attacks vulnerabilities and other code smell` explicitly mention the fix for XXE vulnerabilities.
- The pull request discussion confirms that "Access to external entities and network access should always be disable to avoid XXS attacks vulnerabilities."
- The fix is included in release `1.3.1`.

This information confirms that the provided content is related to CVE-2020-36640 and provides details about the vulnerability and its fix.
