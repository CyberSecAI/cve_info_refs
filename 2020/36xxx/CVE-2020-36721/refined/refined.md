Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-36721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Unauthenticated Function Injection:** Several WordPress themes using the Epsilon Framework have vulnerable AJAX actions (`epsilon_framework_ajax_action`, `epsilon_dashboard_ajax_callback`, `welcome_screen_ajax_callback`). These actions directly call class methods based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization, capability checks, or security nonces. This allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary functions.
*   **Unauthenticated Plugin Activation/Deactivation:** Some themes, like Activello, Brilliance, and Newspaper X, have functions (`activello_activate_plugin`, `activello_deactivate_plugin`) that activate or deactivate plugins without any capability checks or security nonces. These functions are hooked into `admin_init`, which can be triggered by unauthenticated users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Function Injection:** Arbitrary class and method calls can be executed by an attacker by controlling the `$class`, `$method` and `$args` parameters.
*   **Missing Capability Checks:** AJAX actions and plugin activation/deactivation functions lack checks to ensure that only authorized users (administrators) can perform these actions.
*   **Missing Security Nonces:** The lack of nonce verification allows unauthenticated users to trigger the vulnerable code.
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize user-supplied input, allowing arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Through the function injection vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Plugin Manipulation:** Unauthenticated users can activate or deactivate any plugin on the WordPress site, which can lead to a variety of outcomes, including disabling security plugins.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The function injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by sending crafted POST requests to the WordPress AJAX endpoint.
*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The plugin activation/deactivation vulnerabilities can be exploited by sending crafted GET requests that include the vulnerable action, plugin to be modified and tab parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be logged in to exploit either of these vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the WordPress site.

*   Shapely <= 1.2.7
