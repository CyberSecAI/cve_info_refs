### Unauthenticated Function Injection

Depending on the theme and the version, the vulnerability can affect different scripts and three different WordPress AJAX actions:

* `epsilon_framework_ajax_action`
* `epsilon_dashboard_ajax_callback`
* `welcome_screen_ajax_callback`

Some themes include up to two vulnerable actions. They are all almost identical, with just a few differences. In this advisory we’ll see the `epsilon_framework_ajax_action` action found in the “[inc/libraries/epsilon-framework/class-epsilon-framework.php](https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/browser/newsmag/2.4.1/inc/libraries/epsilon-framework/class-epsilon-framework.php)” script from the NewsMag theme v2.4.1 and a slightly different version from the Allegiant theme v1.2.2 found in the “[includes/libraries/epsilon-framework/classes/class-epsilon-ajax-controller.php](https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/browser/allegiant/1.2.2/includes/libraries/epsilon-framework/classes/class-epsilon-ajax-controller.php)” script.

The plugin registers the `epsilon_framework_ajax_action` AJAX action and makes it accessible to all users, authenticated or not, with the WordPress `wp_ajax_*` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_*` hooks:

```
    add_action( 'wp_ajax_epsilon_framework_ajax_action', array(
       $this,
         'epsilon_framework_ajax_action',
      ) );
      add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_epsilon_framework_ajax_action', array(
       $this,
       'epsilon_framework_ajax_action',
    ) );

```

The function takes three POST user input, assigns them to the `$class`, `$method` and `$args` variables and calls the corresponding class and method with optional arguments:

```
  public function epsilon_framework_ajax_action() {
      if ( 'epsilon_framework_ajax_action' !== $_POST['action'] ) {
         wp_die(
            json_encode(
               array(
                  'status' => false,
                  'error'  => 'Not allowed',
               )
            )
         );
      }

      if ( count( $_POST['args']['action'] ) !== 2 ) {
         wp_die(
            json_encode(
               array(
                  'status' => false,
                  'error'  => 'Not allowed',
               )
            )
         );
      }

      if ( ! class_exists( $_POST['args']['action'][0] ) ) {
         wp_die(
            json_encode(
               array(
                  'status' => false,
                  'error'  => 'Class does not exist',
               )
            )
         );
      }

      $class  = $_POST['args']['action'][0];
      $method = $_POST['args']['action'][1];
      $args   = $_POST['args']['args'];

      $response = $class::$method( $args );

```

Although it should be accessible to an administrator only, it lacks a capability check and a security nonce and thus could lead to a critical unauthenticated function injection attack.

A variant of this code can be found in a few other themes such as Allegiant: a security nonce was added to the `epsilon_framework_ajax_action` method:

```
public function epsilon_framework_ajax_action() {
   if ( isset( $_POST['args'], $_POST['args']['nonce'] ) && ! wp_verify_nonce( sanitize_key( $_POST['args']['nonce'] ), 'epsilon_nonce' ) ) {
      wp_die(
         wp_json_encode(
            array(
               'status' => false,
               'error'  => esc_html__( 'Not allowed', 'epsilon-framework' ),
            )
         )
       );
   }
   ...
   ...

```

However, the nonce is checked only if it is set. If it isn’t, the request will not be rejected.

### Unauthenticated Plugin Activation/Deactivation

Brilliance, Activello and Newspaper X are affected by this vulnerability. Although they use different function names, the vulnerability and the way to exploit it are identical. In this advisory, we’ll see [Activello v1.4.0](https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/browser/activello/1.4.0/inc/welcome-screen/class-activello-welcome.php).

In the “inc/welcome-screen/class-activello-welcome.php” script, the `activello_activate_plugin` and `activello_deactivate_plugin` functions are registered via the `admin_init` hook in the `__construct` method:

```
add_action( 'admin_init', array( $this, 'activello_activate_plugin' ) );
add_action( 'admin_init', array( $this, 'activello_deactivate_plugin' ) );

```

The functions are used to activate or deactive WordPress plugins:

```
public function activello_activate_plugin() {
   if ( ! empty( $_GET ) ) {
      /**
       * Check action
       */
      if ( ! empty( $_GET['action'] ) && ! empty( $_GET['plugin'] ) && 'activate_plugin' === $_GET['action'] ) {
         $active_tab = $_GET['tab'];
         $url        = self_admin_url( 'themes.php?page=activello-welcome&tab=' . $active_tab );
         activate_plugin( $_GET['plugin'], $url );
      }
   }
}

public function activello_deactivate_plugin() {
   if ( ! empty( $_GET ) ) {
      /**
       * Check action
       */
      if ( ! empty( $_GET['action'] ) && ! empty( $_GET['plugin'] ) && 'deactivate_plugin' === $_GET['action'] ) {
         $active_tab = $_GET['tab'];
         $url        = self_admin_url( 'themes.php?page=activello-welcome&tab=' . $active_tab );
         $current    = get_option( 'active_plugins', array() );
         $search     = array_search( $_GET['plugin'], $current );
         if ( array_key_exists( $search, $current ) ) {
            unset( $current[ $search ] );
         }
         update_option( 'active_plugins', $current );
      }
   }
}

```

They lack capability checks and security nonces. Because the `admin_init` hook can be triggered by anyone, an unauthenticated user can activate or deactivate any plugin on the blog. An attacker would likely exploit this vulnerability to deactivate a security or antispam plugin, for instance.

### Recommendations

Update any of the above themes to the latest available version.

If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability since October 2019.

### Timeline

The vulnerabilities were discovered and reported to the authors between October and December 2019, and then escalated to the wordpress.org themes team on March and August 2020.

Search

***Tip:** You can search by CVE ID, software name or slug, or the researcher name. Expand to read about more advanced search options.*

If you want to perform more advanced lookups, you can use **keywords** to further refine your search.

For example, `woocommerce researcher:"chloe chamberland"` would search for any vulnerabilities discovered by Chloe Chamberland in software that has WooCommerce in the title.

Keywords are added in `keyword:value` format. If the value contains spaces, you must enclose it in quotation marks.

You can use the following keywords to add criteria to your search:

title
Searches through the title of each vulnerability for matches.

date
Returns vulnerabilities by publication date. Use `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY` format.

cvss-rating
Use `low`, `medium`, `high` or `critical` to limit the search to vulnerabilities with the specified rating.

researcher
Returns vulnerabilities credited to researchers containing the given text.

software
Returns vulnerabilities discovered in software containing the given text.

software-slug
Returns vulnerabilities discovered in software exactly matching the given slug.

software-type
Use `plugin`, `theme` or `core` to limit the search to the specified type of software.

By selecting “Search” you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the Wordfence Intelligence Terms and Conditions.

### Description

The Brilliance <= 1.2.7, Activello <= 1.4.0, and Newspaper X <= 1.3.1 themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Plugin Activation/Deactivation. This is due to the 'activello\_activate\_plugin' and 'activello\_deactivate\_plugin' functions in the 'inc/welcome-screen/class-activello-welcome.php' file missing capability and security checks/nonces. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to activate and deactivate arbitrary plugins installed on a vulnerable site.
