The provided content does not describe a specific CVE, but rather details multiple security vulnerabilities found in the Klapp application. Here's a breakdown of the identified issues:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Authorization Code Exposure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application transmits the authorization codes of other parents to each user, enabling them to impersonate other users.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper access control and data handling. Authorization codes, which act as unique identifiers, are exposed to unauthorized parties.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to other users' accounts, impersonation, and potential misuse of data or functionalities associated with those accounts.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  A user logged into the app can access the authorization codes of other users through API responses.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** A user with a valid Klapp account.

2.  **Unexpiring JSON Web Tokens (JWT):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application uses JWTs for authentication that lack an expiration time.
    *   **Weakness:**  Persistent authentication tokens that do not expire.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker who obtains a JWT can impersonate the corresponding user indefinitely, without needing a username or password, even if the original user has changed their password.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Token can be obtained by intercepting network traffic or from backups.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker who can gain access to the token.

3. **Unencrypted Local Data Storage:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Sensitive information, including tokens, are stored in a local SQLite database without encryption.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of data protection mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker with access to the device can easily access the stored information, including user authentication tokens, and can impersonate a valid user.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Physical access to the device, access through device backups.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker who has physical access to the device or access to a device backup.

4.  **Message Sending to Unauthorized Users:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application allows users to send messages to other users, including parents, by manually modifying the recipient's user ID.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper authorization and input validation.
    *  **Impact:** Users can send messages to other parents by modifying the recipient's user ID, bypassing intended communication restrictions.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  A user logged in the app can modify the recipient identifier in the API request.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** A user with a valid Klapp account.

5.  **Data Transmission via Third-Party Services:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Klapp uses external services (OneSignal and Mailgun) for push notifications and emails.
    *  **Weakness:** Relies on third-party services that might not adhere to the same privacy and security standards.
    *   **Impact:** User data is transmitted and potentially stored by third-party services (OneSignal and Mailgun).
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Data is sent to third-party servers during the normal functioning of the app.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Third-party services have access to transmitted data; also,  a breach at the third-party service could expose this data.

6. **Lack of Certificate Pinning and Jailbreak Detection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The app doesn't implement certificate pinning or jailbreak detection.
    *   **Weakness:**  No protection against man-in-the-middle attacks and increased exposure on jailbroken devices
    *  **Impact:** Increased risk of data interception by malicious actors via man-in-the-middle attacks and other security risks related to jailbroken devices.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, exploits on jailbroken devices.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** A network attacker capable of man-in-the-middle attacks, an attacker with access to a jailbroken device.

7. **Lack of App Access Restrictions:**
    *  **Root Cause:**  The app does not have options to restrict access through pass codes or biometric authentication
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of security measures.
     *  **Impact:** In case the device is left unattended, unauthorized individuals can easily access and misuse the app and its functionalities.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Physical access to an unlocked device.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Physical access to an unlocked device.

8. **Unencrypted data storage on server:**
    * **Root Cause:** Data is stored unencrypted on the server, only transmitted over encrypted channels.
    * **Weakness:** Lack of encryption for data at rest
    * **Impact:** The platform operator and anyone processing the data can read or manipulate it.
    * **Attack Vector:** Internal or external compromise of the server
    * **Attacker Capabilities:** Access to the Klapp server or systems

The article highlights a general lack of security awareness and implementation of basic security principles in the development of the Klapp application. While not directly linked to a CVE, these findings are significant and indicate systemic vulnerabilities.
