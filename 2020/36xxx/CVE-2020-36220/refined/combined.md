### Description

In the affected versions of this crate, `Demuxer<T>` unconditionally implemented `Send` with no trait bounds on `T`.

This allows sending a non-Send type `T` across thread boundaries, which can cause undefined behavior like unlocking a mutex from a thread that didn't lock the mutex, or memory corruption from data race.

The flaw was corrected in commit 0562cbf by adding a `T: Send` bound to the `Send` impl for `Demuxer<T>`.

## Description

![@JOE1994](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10286488?u=b10074df08a0e21e9483938c26612ad8e9dfec4b&v=4&size=48)[JOE1994](https://github.com/JOE1994)opened [on Dec 23, 2020](https://github.com/video-audio/va-ts/issues/4#issue-773481295)

Hello 🦀 , we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) found an undefined-behavior issue in this crate while scanning Rust code on crates.io for potential vulnerabilities.

## Issue

`Send` is unconditionally implemented for `Demuxer`, so that it is possible for a non-Send implementor of `DemuxerEvents` trait to be sent across thread boundaries.

```
unsafe impl<T> Send for Demuxer<T> where T: DemuxerEvents {}
```
## Proof of Concept

Here is a simple program where `Demuxer` is used to move a `MutexGuard`(`!Send` object) to another thread.

It is also possible to create data races by inserting non-Send types like `Rc` or `Cell` into `Demuxer`

(which is not demonstrated in the example code below).

```
use va_ts::{Demuxer, DemuxerEvents, SubtableID, DemuxedPacket, DemuxedTable};
use std::sync::{Mutex, MutexGuard};
use std::thread::{self, ThreadId};
use std::ops::Drop;

struct X(MutexGuard<'static, u64>, ThreadId);
impl DemuxerEvents for X {
    fn on_table(&mut self, _: SubtableID, _: &DemuxedTable) { }
    fn on_packet(&mut self, _: &DemuxedPacket) { }
}
impl Drop for X {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // `MutexGuard` must not be dropped from a thread that didn't lock the `Mutex`.
        //
        // If a thread attempts to unlock a Mutex that it has not locked, it can result in undefined behavior.
        // (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/23465#issuecomment-82730326)
        assert_eq!(self.1, thread::current().id());
    }
}

fn main() {
    let static_mutex = Box::leak(Box::new(Mutex::new(0xbeefbeef_u64)));
    // MutexGuard is `!Send`
    let mutex_guard = static_mutex.lock().unwrap();
    let tid = thread::current().id();

    let demuxer = Demuxer::new(X(mutex_guard, tid));
    std::thread::spawn(move || {
        let demuxer = demuxer;

        // demuxer is dropped here, along with `MutexGuard`.
    }).join().unwrap();
}
```
## Suggested Fix

Adding a trait bound `T: Send` as below will allow the compiler to prevent `Demuxer` from moving `!Send` types across thread boundaries.

```
unsafe impl<T> Send for Demuxer<T> where T: DemuxerEvents + Send {}
```
