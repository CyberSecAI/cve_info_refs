The provided content contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2020-36077.

**CVE-2020-36077**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses an unsafe way to insert data from requests without any validation in the `orderadd.php` file. Specifically, the `customer` parameter from POST request is directly used in an SQL query without sanitization or using prepared statements.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
*  **Impact of exploitation:**  A successful SQL injection attack can lead to unauthorized viewing of user lists, deletion of tables, and potentially gaining administrative rights to the database.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessed via the `orderadd.php` page after authentication. The `customer` parameter in a POST request is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable page. They also need to be able to intercept the HTTP request (e.g., using Burp Suite) and manipulate the `customer` parameter.
