Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36513:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `acc_reader` crate in Rust passing an uninitialized buffer to a user-provided `Read` implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use of Uninitialized Memory:** The core issue is that the `fill_buf()` and `read_up_to()` functions in the `acc_reader` crate provide an uninitialized buffer to a user-provided `Read` implementation.
*   **Memory Exposure:** A malicious or poorly implemented `Read` implementation can read from this uninitialized memory, potentially exposing sensitive data.
*   **Incorrect Byte Counts:** A malicious `Read` implementation can also return an incorrect number of bytes written to the buffer.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** Reading from uninitialized memory leads to undefined behavior, potentially resulting in crashes, data corruption, or other unexpected issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in uninitialized memory.
*   **Data Corruption:** Incorrect byte counts returned by a malicious `Read` implementation could lead to data corruption.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** Reading from uninitialized memory could result in unexpected and potentially harmful program behavior, including crashes.
*   **Denial of Service:** In some cases, reading uninitialized memory can cause crashes, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is through the use of a malicious or flawed implementation of the `Read` trait when using the `acc_reader` crate, which can be provided by a user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a custom implementation of the `Read` trait, which will be used by the vulnerable `acc_reader` crate.
*   The attacker does not need any specific privileges.
*   No user interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `acc_reader` crate versions up to and including 2.0.0.
*   There are currently no patched versions available.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a critical severity rating with a CVSS score of 9.8.
*   The attack vector is network-based with low complexity.

**CWE:**

The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-908: Use of Uninitialized Resource.
