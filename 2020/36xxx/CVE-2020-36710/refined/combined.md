You can use the following keywords to add criteria to your search:

title
Searches through the title of each vulnerability for matches.

date
Returns vulnerabilities by publication date. Use `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY` format.

cvss-rating
Use `low`, `medium`, `high` or `critical` to limit the search to vulnerabilities with the specified rating.

researcher
Returns vulnerabilities credited to researchers containing the given text.

software
Returns vulnerabilities discovered in software containing the given text.

software-slug
Returns vulnerabilities discovered in software exactly matching the given slug.

software-type
Use `plugin`, `theme` or `core` to limit the search to the specified type of software.

# WordPress WPS Hide Login fixed security issue.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [January 27, 2020 - 10:34am [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-wps-hide-login-fixed-security-issue/)

The WordPress [WPS Hide Login](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wps-hide-login/) plugin, which has 500,000+ active installations, is a popular plugin used to hide the WordPress default login page (wp-login.php). It fixed a vulnerability in version 1.5.4.2 and below that could allow an attacker to find and access the secret login page.

In the `plugins_loaded` function, the plugin searches for different substrings in the `REQUEST_URI` environment variable using the `strpos` function:

```

public function plugins_loaded() {

   global $pagenow;

   if ( ! is_multisite()
        && ( strpos( $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 'wp-signup' ) !== false
             || strpos( $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 'wp-activate' ) !== false ) && apply_filters( 'wps_hide_login_signup_enable', false ) === false ) {

      wp_die( __( 'This feature is not enabled.', 'wpserveur-hide-login' ) );

   }
   ...
   ...

```

Because some `REQUEST_URI` occurrences aren’t decoded using the `rawurldecode` function, an attacker could encode those substrings in the URL in order to evade the detection. The plugin would then redirect the user to the hidden login page:

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
X-Redirect-By: WordPress
Location: https://www.example.com/foo/?action=register
Content-Length: 0

```
### Timeline

The vulnerability was reported to the author on January 20, 2020 and a new version 1.5.5 was released the same day.

### Recommendations

Update WPS Hide Login if you have version 1.5.4.2 or below installed.
