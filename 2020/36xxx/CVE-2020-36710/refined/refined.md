Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `WPS Hide Login` plugin's failure to properly decode URL-encoded characters in the `REQUEST_URI` environment variable before checking for specific substrings related to the WordPress login page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Input Validation:** The plugin uses `strpos` to search for specific substrings within the `REQUEST_URI` but does not use `rawurldecode` on the `REQUEST_URI` before this check.
*   **Login Page Disclosure:** By encoding parts of the login URL, attackers could bypass the plugin's intended hiding mechanism for the WordPress login page, revealing the custom login URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposed Login Page:** Attackers could gain access to the custom login page, which was meant to be hidden by the plugin.
*   **Brute Force Attacks:**  With the login page disclosed, unauthenticated attackers could attempt to brute-force user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** Attackers could manipulate the URL by encoding specific substrings that the plugin uses to identify login-related requests. For example encoding `wp-signup` or `wp-activate` in the `REQUEST_URI`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Special Access:** The attacker needs no prior authentication or access to the target site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported on January 20, 2020, and a fix was released on the same day (version 1.5.5).
*   The vulnerable versions are those at or below 1.5.4.2.
