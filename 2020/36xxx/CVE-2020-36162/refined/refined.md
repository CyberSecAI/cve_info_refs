- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Veritas CloudPoint Windows agent uses the OpenSSL library, which attempts to load a configuration file from a path `\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf` that does not exist by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that low-privileged users on Windows systems can create directories under `<drive>:\`. This allows an attacker to create the non-existent configuration file path and place a malicious OpenSSL engine within `openssl.cnf`, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain administrator-level privileges on the system. This access enables the attacker to access all data, applications, etc., on the compromised system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local. A low-privileged user creates a specific directory structure and file, which then is used to execute arbitrary code when the CloudPoint Windows agent attempts to load the OpenSSL configuration file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user on the Windows system where the vulnerable CloudPoint Windows Agent is installed. No prior access to CloudPoint is needed.
