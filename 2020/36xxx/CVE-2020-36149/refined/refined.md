Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36149:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of input data within the `changeAttribute` function in the `libmysofa` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  A NULL pointer dereference occurs within the `changeAttribute` function. Specifically, the code attempts to access `attr->value` without proper validation, leading to a crash if `attr` or `attr->value` is NULL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit leads to a segmentation fault, causing the application using `libmysofa` to crash. This constitutes a denial-of-service vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by opening a maliciously crafted SOFA file. The malformed file contains crafted data that causes `changeAttribute` to dereference a NULL pointer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to craft a malicious SOFA file.
- The attacker must then trick a user or application into opening this file.

**Technical Details:**
- The crash occurs in `tools.c` at line 37.
- The vulnerability was discovered using AddressSanitizer, which reported a SEGV (segmentation violation) at address 0x000000000000.
- A sample crash file (`crash_002_changeAttribute.zip`) was provided to reproduce the crash.
- The `mysofa_open` function, which is used to open SOFA files, triggers the vulnerability.

The provided information details how the vulnerability is triggered and its impact, including code snippets and a crash file, which is significantly more detailed than the official CVE description.
