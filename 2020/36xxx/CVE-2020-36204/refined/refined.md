Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36204:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `TreeFocus` struct in the `im` crate for Rust lacked necessary `Send` and `Sync` trait bounds. The `TreeFocus` is an implementation detail of the `Focus` type and is used with RRB-tree backed vectors. The unsafe implementation of the `Send` and `Sync` traits made it possible for data races to occur, because it is not actually safe to send or share between threads

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing trait bounds:** `TreeFocus` lacked `Send` and `Sync` bounds, which are necessary for safe concurrent access in Rust.
*   **Unsafe implementation**: The `Send` and `Sync` traits were implemented with `unsafe impl` which bypasses normal rust safety checks.
*   **Data race:**  The lack of proper synchronization allows multiple threads to access and modify shared data concurrently, leading to data races

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data corruption:** Concurrent access without proper synchronization can lead to data corruption.
*   **Undefined behavior:** Data races cause undefined behavior, which could lead to crashes, incorrect program behavior, or other unexpected issues.
*   **Memory safety violation:** In the provided example, dereferencing a corrupted address leads to a segmentation fault.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local exploitation**: The vulnerability is triggered by using a `TreeFocus` extracted from a `Focus`, which can be done within the same program.
*   **Concurrent access:**  The attack requires creating multiple threads that simultaneously access and modify a `TreeFocus` object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to use the `im` crate:** The attacker needs to be able to use the `im` crate and create code to trigger a `TreeFocus` object, extract it from the `Focus` enum, and share it between threads.
*   **Knowledge of Rust concurrency:** Understanding how to create and manage threads is necessary to trigger the data race.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability occurs in versions of the `im` crate before 15.1.0 and does not exist in versions before 12.0.0, which is where the `Focus` API was added.
* The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 4.7.
* The exploit involves extracting a `TreeFocus` from a `Focus` and sharing it between threads.
* The `im` library maintainers addressed the issue by adding the proper Send and Sync bounds to TreeFocus, releasing version 15.1.0 which resolved the issue.

**Code Example:**
The provided code example in the github issue shows how to cause a data race by extracting and sharing the `TreeFocus` between threads. The code creates a vector of references to a `Cell` and shares it between two threads. The first thread modifies the content of the cell, and the second thread reads it concurrently which can cause a crash.
