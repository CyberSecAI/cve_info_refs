## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Nov 9, 2020](https://github.com/bodil/im-rs/issues/157#issue-738759511)

It looks like the version of `Focus` for RRB-tree backed vectors, `TreeFocus` lacks bounds for `Sync` and `Send`:

[im-rs/src/vector/focus.rs](https://github.com/bodil/im-rs/blob/22f6907e89cb7d895c3ef729635fcf6483d12fab/src/vector/focus.rs#L280-L285)

Lines 280 to 285
in
[22f6907](/bodil/im-rs/commit/22f6907e89cb7d895c3ef729635fcf6483d12fab)

|  | #[allow(unsafe\_code)] |
| --- | --- |
|  | #[cfg(threadsafe)] |
|  | unsafe impl<A> Send for TreeFocus<A> {} |
|  | #[allow(unsafe\_code)] |
|  | #[cfg(threadsafe)] |
|  | unsafe impl<A> Sync for TreeFocus<A> {} |

I realize `TreeFocus` is an implementation detail and not really meant to be used by end-users of the library but I think this opens up the possibility of causing data-races through safe Rust code like this:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use im::vector;
use im::vector::{Vector, Focus};

use std::{iter, iter::FromIterator, cell::Cell};

use crossbeam_utils::thread;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum RefOrInt<'a> {
    Ref(&'a u64),
    Int(u64),
}
static SOME_INT: u64 = 123;

fn main() {
    let cell = Cell::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
    // Make the Vector big enough so that it gets promoted to a RRB tree.
    let mut vec: Vector<&Cell<RefOrInt>> = Vector::from_iter(
        iter::repeat(&cell).take(1024*5));

    let focus = vec.focus();
    if let Focus::Full(tree_focus) = focus {
        thread::scope(|s| {
            s.spawn(move |_| {
                let mut sent_focus = tree_focus;

                let smuggled_cell = sent_focus.get(0).unwrap();
                loop {
                    // Repeatedly write Ref(&addr) and Int(0xdeadbeef) into the cell.
                    smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
                    smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
                }
            });

            loop {
                if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = cell.get() {
                    // Hope that between the time we pattern match the object as a
                    // `Ref`, it gets written to by the other thread.
                    if addr as *const u64 == &SOME_INT as *const u64 {
                        continue;
                    }

                    // Due to the data race, obtaining Ref(0xdeadbeef) is possible
                    println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
                    println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

which outputs

```
Pointer is now: 0xdeadbeef

Return Code: -11 (SIGSEGV)

```

Patched

* `>=15.1.0`

Unaffected

* `<12.0.0`

### Description

Affected versions of `im` contains `TreeFocus` that unconditionally implements `Send` and `Sync`.

This allows a data race in safe Rust code if `TreeFocus` is extracted from `Focus` type.
Typical users that only use `Focus` type are not affected.

## Patched versions

15.1.0

## Description

An issue was discovered in the im crate prior to 15.1.0 for Rust. Because TreeFocus does not have bounds on its Send trait or Sync trait, a data race can occur.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
