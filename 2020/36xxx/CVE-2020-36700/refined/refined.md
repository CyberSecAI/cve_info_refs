Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a leaked security nonce in the `/wp-admin/index.php` page when the KingComposer plugin is enabled. This nonce is meant to protect AJAX actions but becomes accessible to any logged-in user, including those with low privileges like subscribers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Authorization Bypass:** The leaked nonce bypasses access controls on multiple AJAX actions, allowing unauthorized users to perform privileged operations.
2.  **Improper Access Control:** The plugin doesn't properly validate user roles or capabilities before executing sensitive functions, relying solely on the leaked nonce.
3.  **Arbitrary Option Update:** The `kc_update_option` AJAX action allows modification of any WordPress option in the database.
4.  **Arbitrary File/Folder Deletion:** The `kc_installed_extensions` AJAX action, intended for installing extensions, can be manipulated to delete any file or folder on the server due to lack of path validation.
5.  **Content Injection:** The `kc_push_section` AJAX action allows attackers to modify the content of any page or post, appending or overwriting existing content.
6.  **Stored XSS:** Several shortcodes registered by the plugin do not properly escape attributes, enabling the injection of malicious JavaScript via shortcodes such as `kc_row_inner`.
7.  **Remote Code Execution:** The extension upload functionality in `kc.extensions.php` allows any user with the `upload_files` capability to upload a ZIP file containing a PHP script, which can be executed remotely by accessing the uploaded file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Site Compromise:** Attackers can change critical site options (like admin email, site URL), inject malicious content, and ultimately take over the site by creating administrator accounts.
*   **Data Loss/Manipulation:** Arbitrary file/folder deletion can lead to severe data loss or site malfunction.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The ability to inject content and upload files makes the site a potential platform for distributing malware.
*   **XSS attacks:** Exploitation of the Stored XSS vulnerability allows for arbitrary Javascript execution in the browser of anyone who views a page containing the malicious shortcode, allowing for things like session hijacking, credential theft, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Exploits are performed over HTTP(S) via AJAX requests to the WordPress admin interface.
*   **Plugin Vulnerability:** The vulnerabilities are located within the KingComposer plugin itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the WordPress site. This can be any level of authenticated user, including low-privileged subscribers in most cases, except for Remote Code Execution which requires an account with the 'upload_files' capability (Author or higher).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
*   **No specific user interaction:** Most attacks can be performed by sending manipulated HTTP requests, requiring no direct user interaction beyond the initial login.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jerome Bruandet from NinTechNet.
*   The vulnerable versions of the plugin are up to and including 2.9.3.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.9.4.
*   The plugin is now closed and unavailable for download from the WordPress Plugin Directory due to security concerns.
*   The plugin's developers were unresponsive, requiring escalation to the WordPress.org plugins team.
*   The leaked nonce was located in `/kingcomposer/includes/kc.widgets.php`.
*   The vulnerable AJAX actions are located in `/kingcomposer/includes/kc.ajax.php` and `/kingcomposer/includes/kc.extensions.php`.
