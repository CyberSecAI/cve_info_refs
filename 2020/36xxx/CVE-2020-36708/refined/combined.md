# Large-Scale Attacks Target Epsilon Framework Themes

On November 17, 2020, our Threat Intelligence team noticed a large-scale wave of attacks against recently reported Function Injection vulnerabilities in themes using the Epsilon Framework, which we estimate are installed on over 150,000 sites. So far today, we have seen a surge of more than 7.5 million attacks against more than 1.5 million sites targeting these vulnerabilities, coming from over 18,000 IP addresses. While we occasionally see attacks targeting a large number of sites, most of them target older vulnerabilities.

This wave of attacks is targeting vulnerabilities that have only been patched in the last few months. **All Wordfence users are protected against these attacks, including Wordfence Premium customers and sites still running the free version of Wordfence.**

## Vulnerable Themes

The following versions of the following themes are vulnerable to these attacks:

[Shapely](https://wordpress.org/themes/shapely/) <=1.2.7

[NewsMag](https://wordpress.org/themes/newsmag/) <=2.4.1

[Activello](https://wordpress.org/themes/activello/) <=1.4.0

[Illdy](https://wordpress.org/themes/illdy/) <=2.1.4

[Allegiant](https://wordpress.org/themes/allegiant/) <=1.2.2

[Newspaper X](https://wordpress.org/themes/newspaper-x/) <=1.3.1

[Pixova Lite](https://wordpress.org/themes/pixova-lite/) <=2.0.5

[Brilliance](https://wordpress.org/themes/brilliance/) <=1.2.7

[MedZone Lite](https://wordpress.org/themes/medzone-lite/) <=1.2.4

[Regina Lite](https://wordpress.org/themes/regina-lite/) <=2.0.4

[Transcend](https://wordpress.org/themes/transcend/) <=1.1.8

[Affluent](https://wordpress.org/themes/affluent/) <1.1.0

[Bonkers](https://wordpress.org/themes/bonkers/) <=1.0.4

[Antreas](https://wordpress.org/themes/antreas/) <=1.0.2

[NatureMag Lite](https://wordpress.org/themes/naturemag-lite/) <=1.0.5

## Probing attacks – For now

For the time being, the vast majority of these attacks appear to be probing attacks, designed to determine whether a site has a vulnerable theme installed rather than to perform an exploit chain, though full Remote Code Execution(RCE) leading to site takeover is possible with these vulnerabilities. Even though all Wordfence users are protected, we strongly recommend updating as soon as possible. We are not providing additional detail on the attacks at this time, as the exploit does not yet appear to be in a mature state and a large number of IP addresses are in use. These attacks use `POST` requests to `admin-ajax.php` and as such do not leave distinct log entries, though they will be visible in Wordfence Live Traffic.

## What should I do?

If your website is running one of these themes, it is critical to update to a patched version if one is available. If no patched version is available you will want to temporarily switch to another theme or use a firewall like Wordfence, either [Premium](https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-signup/?promo_id=blog20201117&promo_name=get-premium&promo_creative=txt&promo_position=conclusion) or free, that blocks these attacks. If you have made customizations to these themes without the use of a child theme, you will want to download a backup copy of the current version before updating. If anyone you know is running any of these themes, please share this article to ensure they update their site as well.

  Thanks for advisor,

  Gracias por el aviso en realidad antes de tener wordfence fui hackeado y hoy implemento Wordfence en todos mis sitios y su eficacia ha sido increible.

  Yo soy un diseñador y administrador de sitios web asi que se de lo que les estoy hablando

  por eso y por mas, thanks, muchas gracias.

# Unauthenticated function injection vulnerability fixed in 15 WordPress themes.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [October 1, 2020 - 12:31pm [+0700]January 21, 2021 - 6:20pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/unauthenticated-function-injection-vulnerability-fixed-in-15-wordpress-themes/)

Fifteen WordPress themes were prone to a critical unauthenticated function injection vulnerability, among other issues.

* [NatureMag Lite](https://wordpress.org/themes/naturemag-lite/) <=1.0.4. Partially fixed in v1.0.5, however the theme is no longer available in the wordpress.org repo.

### Unauthenticated Function Injection

Depending on the theme and the version, the vulnerability can affect different scripts and three different WordPress AJAX actions:

* `epsilon_framework_ajax_action`
* `epsilon_dashboard_ajax_callback`
* `welcome_screen_ajax_callback`

Some themes include up to two vulnerable actions. They are all almost identical, with just a few differences. In this advisory we’ll see the `epsilon_framework_ajax_action` action found in the “[inc/libraries/epsilon-framework/class-epsilon-framework.php](https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/browser/newsmag/2.4.1/inc/libraries/epsilon-framework/class-epsilon-framework.php)” script from the NewsMag theme v2.4.1 and a slightly different version from the Allegiant theme v1.2.2 found in the “[includes/libraries/epsilon-framework/classes/class-epsilon-ajax-controller.php](https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/browser/allegiant/1.2.2/includes/libraries/epsilon-framework/classes/class-epsilon-ajax-controller.php)” script.

The plugin registers the `epsilon_framework_ajax_action` AJAX action and makes it accessible to all users, authenticated or not, with the WordPress `wp_ajax_*` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_*` hooks:

```
    add_action( 'wp_ajax_epsilon_framework_ajax_action', array(
       $this,
         'epsilon_framework_ajax_action',
      ) );
      add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_epsilon_framework_ajax_action', array(
       $this,
       'epsilon_framework_ajax_action',
    ) );

```

The function takes three POST user input, assigns them to the `$class`, `$method` and `$args` variables and calls the corresponding class and method with optional arguments:

```
  public function epsilon_framework_ajax_action() {
      if ( 'epsilon_framework_ajax_action' !== $_POST['action'] ) {
         wp_die(
            json_encode(
               array(
                  'status' => false,
                  'error'  => 'Not allowed',
               )
            )
         );
      }

      if ( count( $_POST['args']['action'] ) !== 2 ) {
         wp_die(
            json_encode(
               array(
                  'status' => false,
                  'error'  => 'Not allowed',
               )
            )
         );
      }

      if ( ! class_exists( $_POST['args']['action'][0] ) ) {
         wp_die(
            json_encode(
               array(
                  'status' => false,
                  'error'  => 'Class does not exist',
               )
            )
         );
      }

      $class  = $_POST['args']['action'][0];
      $method = $_POST['args']['action'][1];
      $args   = $_POST['args']['args'];

      $response = $class::$method( $args );

```

Although it should be accessible to an administrator only, it lacks a capability check and a security nonce and thus could lead to a critical unauthenticated function injection attack.

A variant of this code can be found in a few other themes such as Allegiant: a security nonce was added to the `epsilon_framework_ajax_action` method:

```
public function epsilon_framework_ajax_action() {
   if ( isset( $_POST['args'], $_POST['args']['nonce'] ) && ! wp_verify_nonce( sanitize_key( $_POST['args']['nonce'] ), 'epsilon_nonce' ) ) {
      wp_die(
         wp_json_encode(
            array(
               'status' => false,
               'error'  => esc_html__( 'Not allowed', 'epsilon-framework' ),
            )
         )
       );
   }
   ...
   ...

```

However, the nonce is checked only if it is set. If it isn’t, the request will not be rejected.

### Unauthenticated Plugin Activation/Deactivation

Brilliance, Activello and Newspaper X are affected by this vulnerability. Although they use different function names, the vulnerability and the way to exploit it are identical. In this advisory, we’ll see [Activello v1.4.0](https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/browser/activello/1.4.0/inc/welcome-screen/class-activello-welcome.php).

In the “inc/welcome-screen/class-activello-welcome.php” script, the `activello_activate_plugin` and `activello_deactivate_plugin` functions are registered via the `admin_init` hook in the `__construct` method:

```
add_action( 'admin_init', array( $this, 'activello_activate_plugin' ) );
add_action( 'admin_init', array( $this, 'activello_deactivate_plugin' ) );

```

The functions are used to activate or deactive WordPress plugins:

```
public function activello_activate_plugin() {
   if ( ! empty( $_GET ) ) {
      /**
       * Check action
       */
      if ( ! empty( $_GET['action'] ) && ! empty( $_GET['plugin'] ) && 'activate_plugin' === $_GET['action'] ) {
         $active_tab = $_GET['tab'];
         $url        = self_admin_url( 'themes.php?page=activello-welcome&tab=' . $active_tab );
         activate_plugin( $_GET['plugin'], $url );
      }
   }
}

public function activello_deactivate_plugin() {
   if ( ! empty( $_GET ) ) {
      /**
       * Check action
       */
      if ( ! empty( $_GET['action'] ) && ! empty( $_GET['plugin'] ) && 'deactivate_plugin' === $_GET['action'] ) {
         $active_tab = $_GET['tab'];
         $url        = self_admin_url( 'themes.php?page=activello-welcome&tab=' . $active_tab );
         $current    = get_option( 'active_plugins', array() );
         $search     = array_search( $_GET['plugin'], $current );
         if ( array_key_exists( $search, $current ) ) {
            unset( $current[ $search ] );
         }
         update_option( 'active_plugins', $current );
      }
   }
}

```

They lack capability checks and security nonces. Because the `admin_init` hook can be triggered by anyone, an unauthenticated user can activate or deactivate any plugin on the blog. An attacker would likely exploit this vulnerability to deactivate a security or antispam plugin, for instance.

### Recommendations

### Description

The following themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Function Injections in versions up to and including Shapely <= 1.2.7, NewsMag <= 2.4.1, Activello <= 1.4.0, Illdy <= 2.1.4, Allegiant <= 1.2.2, Newspaper X <= 1.3.1, Pixova Lite <= 2.0.5, Brilliance <= 1.2.7, MedZone Lite <= 1.2.4, Regina Lite <= 2.0.4, Transcend <= 1.1.8, Affluent <= 1.1.0, Bonkers <= 1.0.4, Antreas <= 1.0.2, Sparkling <= 2.4.8, and NatureMag Lite <= 1.0.4. This is due to epsilon\_framework\_ajax\_action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call functions and achieve remote code execution.

# Unauthenticated function injection vulnerability in WordPress Sparkling theme.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [February 10, 2022 - 5:41pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/unauthenticated-function-injection-vulnerability-in-wordpress-sparkling-theme/)

The WordPress [Sparkling theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/sparkling/), which has 30,000+ active installations, fixed a unauthenticated function injection vulnerability affecting version 2.4.8 and below.

### Unauthenticated Function Injection

CVSS v3.1: [7.3 (High)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

The vulnerability is identical to the one [we reported](https://blog.nintechnet.com/unauthenticated-function-injection-vulnerability-fixed-in-15-wordpress-themes/) on October 1st, 2020, that was affecting 15 themes using the Epsilon framework.

In the “inc/libraries/epsilon-framework/class-epsilon-framework.php” script, Sparkling uses the same unauthenticated `epsilon_framework_ajax_action` AJAX action:

```
add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_epsilon_framework_ajax_action', array(
   $this,
   'epsilon_framework_ajax_action',
) );

```

An unauthenticated user can perform a function injection attack.

The impact of such vulnerability is difficult to rate because it depends on what plugins are installed on the website, but it could be used to perform some critical attacks. For instance, if popular plugins such as WooCommerce or Jetpack (5+ million installations each) are installed, an unauthenticated attacker can delete all products of the former and drop its tables in the database, or delete the configuration of the latter and disable its security modules.

### Timeline

The vulnerability was discovered and reported to the authors on October 2019, and then escalated to the wordpress.org themes team on March and August 2020. It was eventually fixed on February 9, 2022.

### Recommendations

Update immediately if you have version 2.4.8 or below installed. If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.

Depending on the theme and the version, the vulnerability can affect different scripts and three different WordPress AJAX actions:

* `epsilon_framework_ajax_action`
* `epsilon_dashboard_ajax_callback`
* `welcome_screen_ajax_callback`

Some themes include up to two vulnerable actions. They are all almost identical, with just a few differences. In this advisory we’ll see the `epsilon_framework_ajax_action` action found in the “[inc/libraries/epsilon-framework/class-epsilon-framework.php](https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/browser/newsmag/2.4.1/inc/libraries/epsilon-framework/class-epsilon-framework.php)” script from the NewsMag theme v2.4.1 and a slightly different version from the Allegiant theme v1.2.2 found in the “[includes/libraries/epsilon-framework/classes/class-epsilon-ajax-controller.php](https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/browser/allegiant/1.2.2/includes/libraries/epsilon-framework/classes/class-epsilon-ajax-controller.php)” script.

The plugin registers the `epsilon_framework_ajax_action` AJAX action and makes it accessible to all users, authenticated or not, with the WordPress `wp_ajax_*` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_*` hooks:

```
    add_action( 'wp_ajax_epsilon_framework_ajax_action', array(
       $this,
         'epsilon_framework_ajax_action',
      ) );
      add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_epsilon_framework_ajax_action', array(
       $this,
       'epsilon_framework_ajax_action',
    ) );

```

The function takes three POST user input, assigns them to the `$class`, `$method` and `$args` variables and calls the corresponding class and method with optional arguments:

```
  public function epsilon_framework_ajax_action() {
      if ( 'epsilon_framework_ajax_action' !== $_POST['action'] ) {
         wp_die(
            json_encode(
               array(
                  'status' => false,
                  'error'  => 'Not allowed',
               )
            )
         );
      }

      if ( count( $_POST['args']['action'] ) !== 2 ) {
         wp_die(
            json_encode(
               array(
                  'status' => false,
                  'error'  => 'Not allowed',
               )
            )
         );
      }

      if ( ! class_exists( $_POST['args']['action'][0] ) ) {
         wp_die(
            json_encode(
               array(
                  'status' => false,
                  'error'  => 'Class does not exist',
               )
            )
         );
      }

      $class  = $_POST['args']['action'][0];
      $method = $_POST['args']['action'][1];
      $args   = $_POST['args']['args'];

      $response = $class::$method( $args );

```

Although it should be accessible to an administrator only, it lacks a capability check and a security nonce and thus could lead to a critical unauthenticated function injection attack.

A variant of this code can be found in a few other themes such as Allegiant: a security nonce was added to the `epsilon_framework_ajax_action` method:

```
public function epsilon_framework_ajax_action() {
   if ( isset( $_POST['args'], $_POST['args']['nonce'] ) && ! wp_verify_nonce( sanitize_key( $_POST['args']['nonce'] ), 'epsilon_nonce' ) ) {
      wp_die(
         wp_json_encode(
            array(
               'status' => false,
               'error'  => esc_html__( 'Not allowed', 'epsilon-framework' ),
            )
         )
       );
   }
   ...
   ...

```

However, the nonce is checked only if it is set. If it isn’t, the request will not be rejected.

### Unauthenticated Plugin Activation/Deactivation

Brilliance, Activello and Newspaper X are affected by this vulnerability. Although they use different function names, the vulnerability and the way to exploit it are identical. In this advisory, we’ll see [Activello v1.4.0](https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/browser/activello/1.4.0/inc/welcome-screen/class-activello-welcome.php).

In the “inc/welcome-screen/class-activello-welcome.php” script, the `activello_activate_plugin` and `activello_deactivate_plugin` functions are registered via the `admin_init` hook in the `__construct` method:

```
add_action( 'admin_init', array( $this, 'activello_activate_plugin' ) );
add_action( 'admin_init', array( $this, 'activello_deactivate_plugin' ) );

```

The functions are used to activate or deactive WordPress plugins:

```
public function activello_activate_plugin() {
   if ( ! empty( $_GET ) ) {
      /**
       * Check action
       */
      if ( ! empty( $_GET['action'] ) && ! empty( $_GET['plugin'] ) && 'activate_plugin' === $_GET['action'] ) {
         $active_tab = $_GET['tab'];
         $url        = self_admin_url( 'themes.php?page=activello-welcome&tab=' . $active_tab );
         activate_plugin( $_GET['plugin'], $url );
      }
   }
}

public function activello_deactivate_plugin() {
   if ( ! empty( $_GET ) ) {
      /**
       * Check action
       */
      if ( ! empty( $_GET['action'] ) && ! empty( $_GET['plugin'] ) && 'deactivate_plugin' === $_GET['action'] ) {
         $active_tab = $_GET['tab'];
         $url        = self_admin_url( 'themes.php?page=activello-welcome&tab=' . $active_tab );
         $current    = get_option( 'active_plugins', array() );
         $search     = array_search( $_GET['plugin'], $current );
         if ( array_key_exists( $search, $current ) ) {
            unset( $current[ $search ] );
         }
         update_option( 'active_plugins', $current );
      }
   }
}

```

They lack capability checks and security nonces. Because the `admin_init` hook can be triggered by anyone, an unauthenticated user can activate or deactivate any plugin on the blog. An attacker would likely exploit this vulnerability to deactivate a security or antispam plugin, for instance.

# Multiple Themes - Unauthenticated Function Injection

### Description

Jerome Bruandet, from nintechnet, discovered numerous themes affected by Unauthenticated Function Injection issues, due to the lack of capability and CSRF nonce checks in AJAX actions.

The naturemag-lite theme partially fixed the issues in v1.0.5, however it has been removed from the WordPress repository.

Three of the themes, Brilliance, Activello and Newspaper X were also affected by an Unauthenticated Plugin Activation/Deactivation issue.
