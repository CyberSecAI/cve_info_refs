Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-36708:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper access control and security checks in several WordPress themes that use the Epsilon Framework. Specifically, the `epsilon_framework_ajax_action`, `epsilon_dashboard_ajax_callback`, and `welcome_screen_ajax_callback` AJAX actions are vulnerable. These actions allow unauthenticated users to call arbitrary functions due to the absence of capability checks and security nonces, or in some instances, inadequate nonce validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unauthenticated Function Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary functions. The vulnerable AJAX actions process user-supplied parameters to determine which class, method, and arguments are to be used in a function call. This allows an attacker to specify a class and method to execute, along with arguments, potentially leading to remote code execution.
2.  **Missing Capability Checks:** The AJAX actions do not verify if the user has the necessary capabilities to perform the intended actions, thus making it accessible to unauthenticated users.
3.  **Missing or Insufficient Security Nonces:** The AJAX actions lack security nonces, or, in some themes, the nonce check is present but not enforced if the nonce parameter is missing from the request. This allows the actions to be executed by any user, authenticated or not, without CSRF protection.
4.  **Unauthenticated Plugin Activation/Deactivation (Specific Themes):** Some of the themes (Brilliance, Activello, and Newspaper X) also have an unauthenticated plugin activation/deactivation issue. The theme's welcome screen functionality can be accessed without authentication to activate or deactivate plugins, allowing attackers to potentially disable security or anti-spam plugins.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can achieve Remote Code Execution by injecting and executing arbitrary PHP code on the server. This could lead to complete site takeover.
2.  **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify the site's database, delete content (products, configurations, etc.), or create backdoors.
3.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** By calling resource-intensive functions or modifying site configurations, an attacker could cause a denial of service.
4.  **Plugin Manipulation:**  Attackers can activate or deactivate arbitrary plugins, including security plugins, to further facilitate exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via HTTP POST requests to the `admin-ajax.php` file, with the vulnerable AJAX action specified in the request parameters. This vector is common to all the themes that implement the vulnerable Epsilon Framework code.
*   For the plugin activation/deactivation vulnerability, the attack vector is via HTTP GET requests to the site, with the vulnerable `action` and `plugin` parameters in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the WordPress site to exploit the function injection vulnerability. The plugin activation/deactivation vulnerability also does not require authentication.
*   **Network access:** The attacker only requires network access to the target WordPress site to send HTTP requests.

**Themes Affected:**

*   Shapely <=1.2.7
*   NewsMag <=2.4.1
*   Activello <=1.4.0
*   Illdy <=2.1.4
*   Allegiant <=1.2.2
*   Newspaper X <=1.3.1
*   Pixova Lite <=2.0.5
*   Brilliance <=1.2.7
*   MedZone Lite <=1.2.4
*   Regina Lite <=2.0.4
*   Transcend <=1.1.8
*   Affluent <1.1.0
*   Bonkers <=1.0.4
*   Antreas <=1.0.2
*   NatureMag Lite <=1.0.4
*   Sparkling <= 2.4.8

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jerome Bruandet from NinTechNet.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the authors between October and December 2019 and then escalated to the wordpress.org themes team in March and August 2020.
*   Wordfence users are protected from these attacks.
*   Some of the vulnerable themes implement a version of the nonce check, but it is not enforced if the nonce is missing.
