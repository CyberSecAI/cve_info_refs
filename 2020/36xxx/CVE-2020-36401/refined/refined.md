Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-36401 (though not explicitly stated, the provided data points to this CVE)

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-double-free in the `mrb_default_allocf` function of mruby.
- The root cause stems from a flawed logic in the `mrb_realloc` function. When `realloc` fails and returns NULL, the original memory pointed to by `p` should not be freed by `mrb_free(mrb,p)` because `realloc` would already have freed it. However, the code was freeing the original pointer `p`, even after a failed `realloc`, which causes a double free.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap double-free vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to a crash of the application due to memory corruption. It is also possible to overwrite heap metadata with crafted data, which can lead to code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when realloc fails and the original pointer is freed again, leading to a double free. It requires crafting input to trigger realloc, which might lead to memory exhaustion.
- The provided information suggests that the vulnerability can be triggered through an OSS-Fuzz input, implying a fuzzing-based exploit vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input that will trigger a failed `realloc` operation followed by a free operation on the original pointer.
- No specific capabilities are mentioned in the provided data beyond the ability to trigger the vulnerable code through a specific input.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit diff shows the fix to the vulnerability. The problematic line `mrb_free(mrb, p);` was removed from the `mrb_realloc` function to prevent the double free.
- The OSS-Fuzz report (linked in the yaml file) provides more details on the exact scenario for reproducing the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is described as a "Heap-double-free".
- The vulnerability exists in the `mrb_default_allocf` function.
- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `9cdf439db52b66447b4e37c61179d54fad6c8f33` and fixed by commit `97319697c8f9f6ff27b32589947e1918e3015503`.
- Affected versions of mruby include 2.1.2, 2.1.2-rc, and 2.1.2-rc2.
- The severity is rated as HIGH.
