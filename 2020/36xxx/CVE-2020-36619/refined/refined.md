{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `_verbprintf` function in `unixinput.c` used the output of `add_ch` as a format string, leading to an uncontrolled format string vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled format string vulnerability."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution or denial of service due to stack corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": "Maliciously crafted FLEX messages with format specifiers (`%`) in the message content.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to inject a crafted FLEX message into the input stream of the vulnerable `multimon-ng` application."
  },
  "fixes": [
        "The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the `add_ch` function to escape the `%` character by replacing it with `%%`, effectively preventing it from being interpreted as a format specifier.",
    ],
  "additional_notes": "The fix also includes filtering non-printable characters, converting % into literal (%%), and ensuring that messages are printed on a single line."
