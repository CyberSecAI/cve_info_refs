Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from missing capability checks on several AJAX actions within the "Ultimate Addons for Gutenberg" plugin. These actions are meant to modify plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin does not properly verify if the user initiating the AJAX request has the necessary permissions to perform the intended actions.
*   **Nonce Leakage:** The plugin incorrectly relies on `$_REQUEST['page']` instead of `$_GET['page']` when generating a security nonce. This results in the nonce being exposed on the page source to any authenticated user, even those with low-level privileges, if they send a `$_POST['page'] = 'uag'` parameter in the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Authenticated attackers with subscriber-level (or higher) roles can modify the plugin's settings. This could potentially lead to various issues such as:
    *   Enabling/disabling plugin features without authorization
    *   Potentially injecting malicious code or content by manipulating the plugin settings
    *   Denial of service by misconfiguring the plugin
  
**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered via AJAX requests.
*   The attacker sends a `$_POST['page'] = 'uag'` parameter which causes the nonce to be leaked and then uses the leaked nonce to interact with the vulnerable AJAX actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user of the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges.
*   The attacker must be able to make requests to the vulnerable AJAX actions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The specific vulnerable AJAX actions are: `uagb_activate_widget`, `uagb_deactivate_widget`, `uagb_bulk_activate_widgets`, `uagb_bulk_deactivate_widgets`, `uagb_allow_beta_updates`, and `uagb_file_generation`.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.14.8 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability was reported on March 26, 2020 and a fix was released on March 30, 2020.
