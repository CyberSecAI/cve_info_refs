### Description

The Ultimate Addons for Gutenberg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authenticated Settings Change in versions up to, and including, 1.14.7. This is due to missing capability checks on several AJAX actions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber+ roles to update the plugin's settings.

# WordPress Ultimate Addons for Gutenberg plugin fixed vulnerability.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [April 8, 2020 - 11:09pm [+0700]April 10, 2020 - 3:19pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-ultimate-addons-for-gutenberg-plugin-fixed-vulnerability/)

The WordPress [Ultimate Addons for Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-addons-for-gutenberg/) plugin (200,000+ active installations) fixed an authenticated settings change vulnerability affecting version 1.14.7 and below.

The plugin registers six AJAX actions in the “ultimate-addons-for-gutenberg/classes/class-uagb-admin.php” script: `uagb_activate_widget`, `uagb_deactivate_widget`, `uagb_bulk_activate_widgets`, `uagb_bulk_deactivate_widgets`, `uagb_allow_beta_updates` and `uagb_file_generation`.

All of them have a very similar structure: they lack capability checks and rely only on the same `uagb-block-nonce` nonce. For instance, the `activate_widget` function:

```

public static function activate_widget() {

   check_ajax_referer( 'uagb-block-nonce', 'nonce' );

   $block_id            = sanitize_text_field( $_POST['block_id'] );
   $blocks              = UAGB_Helper::get_admin_settings_option( '_uagb_blocks', array() );
   $blocks[ $block_id ] = $block_id;
   $blocks              = array_map( 'esc_attr', $blocks );

   // Update blocks.
   UAGB_Helper::update_admin_settings_option( '_uagb_blocks', $blocks );
   UAGB_Helper::create_specific_stylesheet();

   echo $block_id;

   die();
}

```

The nonce is populated in the `styles_scripts` function and needs to be echoed when a logged-in administrator visits the plugin’s settings page (wp-admin/options-general.php?page=uag):

```

   // Enqueue admin scripts.
   if ( isset( $_REQUEST['page'] ) && UAGB_SLUG === $_REQUEST['page'] ) {
      add_action( 'admin_enqueue_scripts', __CLASS__ . '::styles_scripts' );
      self::save_settings();
   }

```

However, because the plugin relies on `$_REQUEST['page']` while WordPress relies on `$_GET['page']`, any authenticated user could send a `$_POST['page'] = 'uag'` to the current page, WordPress would ignore it but Ultimate Addons for Gutenberg would catch it and leak the security nonce in the source of the page, allowing the user to interact with all six AJAX actions:

### Recommendations

Update the plugin if you have version 1.14.7 or below installed.

### Timeline

The vulnerability was reported on March 26, 2020 and a new version 1.14.8 was released on March 30, 2020.
