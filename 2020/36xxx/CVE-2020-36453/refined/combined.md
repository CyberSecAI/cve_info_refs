## The queues of Michael and Scott implemented in rust

Currently Rust only has multi producer single consumer queues. I wanted to have
a multi producer, multi consumer queue. So I read the [Michael/Scott paper](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/research/synchronization/pseudocode/queues.html) and attempted to implement them. Currently the
only stable queue is scottqueue::tlqueue which is the Two Lock queue described
in the paper. Work on the Non-Blocking Concurrent Queue is still in progress.

## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Nov 15, 2020](https://github.com/rossdylan/rust-scottqueue/issues/1#issue-743211990)

Hi there, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are scanning crates on crates.io for potential soundness bugs. We noticed that the `Queue` object implements `Send` and `Sync` unconiditionally:

[rust-scottqueue/src/tlqueue.rs](https://github.com/rossdylan/rust-scottqueue/blob/875491d79cc6d2e222afaeed6cd51902b523c3c9/src/tlqueue.rs#L27-L28)

Lines 27 to 28
in
[875491d](/rossdylan/rust-scottqueue/commit/875491d79cc6d2e222afaeed6cd51902b523c3c9)

|  | unsafe impl<T> Sync for Queue<T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<T> Send for Queue<T> {} |

However, this should probably be bounded by `T: Send` in both, otherwise it allows sending types that should never be sent across threads such as `Rc` or references to cells. You can see an example of such a data-race with cells below:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use scottqueue::tlqueue::Queue;

use std::cell::Cell;
use crossbeam_utils::thread;

// A simple tagged union used to demonstrate problems with data races in Cell.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum RefOrInt { Ref(&'static u64), Int(u64) }
static SOME_INT: u64 = 123;

fn main() {
    let cell = Cell::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));

    let queue = Queue::new();
    queue.push(&cell);

    thread::scope(|s| {
        s.spawn(|_| {
            let smuggled_cell = queue.pop().unwrap();
            loop {
                // Repeatedly write Ref(&addr) and Int(0xdeadbeef) into the cell.
                smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
                smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
            }
        });

        loop {
            if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = cell.get() {
                // Hope that between the time we pattern match the object as a
                // `Ref`, it gets written to by the other thread.
                if addr as *const u64 == &SOME_INT as *const u64 { continue; }

                println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
                println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
            }
        }
    });
}
```

This outputs:

```
Pointer is now: 0xdeadbeef

Return Code: -11 (SIGSEGV)

```

## Package

cargo

scottqueue
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

<= 0.1.0

## Patched versions

None

## Description

An issue was discovered in the scottqueue crate through 2020-11-15 for Rust. There are unconditional implementations of Send and Sync for Queue. This allows (1) creating data races to a `T: !Sync` and (2) sending `T: !Send` to other threads, resulting in memory corruption or other undefined behavior.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
