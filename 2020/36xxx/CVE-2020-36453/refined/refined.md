Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2020-36453.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `Queue` object in the `scottqueue` crate unconditionally implements the `Send` and `Sync` traits, without requiring the contained type `T` to also implement those traits.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unconditional `Send` and `Sync` implementations for `Queue<T>`.
- Allows sending non-`Send` types across threads.
- Allows creating data races with non-`Sync` types.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption due to data races.
- Undefined behavior, including segmentation faults, caused by unsafely accessed data.

**Attack vectors:**
- By creating an instance of `Queue` with a type `T` that does not implement `Send` or `Sync`.
- Passing the `Queue` object to another thread.
- Performing read/write operations on the object from multiple threads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create and use multi-threaded applications.
- Knowledge of Rust's `Send` and `Sync` traits and their implications.
- Ability to introduce an object that doesn't implement `Send` or `Sync` into the queue.

The provided information includes a proof-of-concept code demonstrating a data race with `Cell`, which leads to a segmentation fault, further illustrating the impact of the vulnerability. The provided information also includes CVSS v3 score, which is 8.1 HIGH, and a link to the National Vulnerability Database for additional details, which is also included.
