The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Contact" feature of the LavaLite CMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization when handling user-submitted content in the "Contact" feature. Specifically, the system fails to properly encode HTML entities, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored and executed when a user views the contact form.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: The injected script is persistently stored in the database and executed whenever the affected page is viewed.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-provided input. Specifically, it fails to prevent injection of HTML and JavaScript via the contact form's fields.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit could allow an attacker to:
- Transmit private user data, such as cookies or session information, to the attacker.
- Redirect victims to malicious websites controlled by the attacker.
- Perform malicious operations on the user's machine within the context of the vulnerable website.

**Attack vectors:**
- User-submitted content: The attacker injects the XSS payload via the "Contact" feature, specifically the "New Contact" form.
- Stored payload execution: When the contact data is viewed, the stored payload is executed within the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user within the CMS.
- Access to the admin panel: The attacker needs to access the administrative interface of the CMS.
- Basic knowledge of XSS attacks: The attacker needs to know how to craft a malicious JavaScript payload.
