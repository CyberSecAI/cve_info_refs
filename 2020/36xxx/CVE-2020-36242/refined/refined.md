Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36242:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the `cryptography` library when handling large data during symmetric encryption. Specifically, the issue occurs when certain sequences of `update()` calls are used to encrypt payloads larger than 2GB.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Integer overflow: The core issue is an integer overflow, which leads to incorrect calculations related to buffer sizes.
- Buffer overflow: The integer overflow results in a buffer overflow, which can overwrite memory and cause unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Memory corruption: A successful exploit can lead to memory corruption.
- Unpredictable behavior: Memory corruption can cause a variety of issues, including application crashes, unexpected behavior, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- The vulnerability can cause a crash due to "free(): invalid size" or "munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer" or return incorrect decrypted data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered during the encryption process, specifically when using the `update()` method with large payloads.
- An attacker needs to provide large data as an input to `cryptography` during symmetric encryption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs the ability to trigger symmetric encryption operations within an application using `cryptography` library and be able to control the size of the input.
- The attacker does not necessarily need direct access to the system, and the attack can be triggered remotely through an application that uses `cryptography` if the attacker can control the input that is encrypted.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- The vulnerability affects `cryptography` versions prior to 3.3.2.
- The vulnerability was addressed in `cryptography` version 3.3.2.
- The fix involved correcting buffer overflows caused by the integer overflow in OpenSSL.
- The vulnerability is related to an underlying issue in OpenSSL (*CVE-2021-23840*) which is fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j.
- The issue is present when using Fernet class for encryption of data greater than 2GB.

- The issue was found by "gablank" and reported as issue #5615 in the cryptography library's GitHub repository.
- The fix is mentioned in the changelog as "Fixed a bug where certain sequences of update() calls when symmetrically encrypting very large payloads (>2GB) could result in an integer overflow, leading to buffer overflows."
