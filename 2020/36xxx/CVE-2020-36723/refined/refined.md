Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36723:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in two main issues within the "ListingPro - WordPress Directory & Listing Theme":

*   **Unauthenticated Plugin Installation:** The theme's "Command Center" feature, responsible for installing and activating bundled plugins, exposes an AJAX action (`lp_cc_addons_actions`) to unauthenticated users. This allows them to install arbitrary plugins from external URLs by exploiting the `install` action.
*   **Unauthenticated Information Disclosure:** The theme includes a feature that exports user data to a CSV file. The function responsible for this is accessible to unauthenticated users via a direct request (`/wp-admin/index.php?download-lp-users=yes`), due to misuse of the `is_admin()` check.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The `lp_cc_addons_actions` AJAX action and the user data export feature fail to properly restrict access based on user roles and permissions.
*   **Lack of Security Nonce:** The AJAX action lacks a security nonce, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks and exploitable by unauthenticated users.
*   **Insecure Plugin Installation:** The plugin installation feature does not validate the origin or content of the plugin ZIP files to be installed from external URLs.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** User data, including usernames, full names, email addresses, phone numbers, and post counts, are exposed to unauthenticated attackers through CSV export.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the unauthenticated plugin installation vulnerability, attackers can install malicious plugins, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to complete website compromise.
*   **Data Breach:** The information disclosure vulnerability exposes sensitive user information that could be used for malicious purposes such as spamming, phishing, or identity theft.
*   **Denial of Service:** While not directly indicated, the ability to deactivate plugins could lead to denial-of-service conditions.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, unauthenticated exploitation:**
    *   The plugin installation vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted AJAX requests to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `lp_cc_addons_actions` action.
    *   The information disclosure vulnerability can be exploited by sending a direct HTTP request to `wp-admin/index.php?download-lp-users=yes`.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** No user credentials or access level is required.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the target website.

**Additional Details (From the Content):**

*   The vulnerability affects ListingPro theme versions below 2.6.1.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Jerome Bruandet of NinTechNet.
*   The vendor was initially unresponsive, requiring escalation through Envato.
*   The issue was partially fixed in versions 2.5.14 and 2.6 but completely resolved in 2.6.1.
*   The `is_admin()` function was misused which is why unauthenticated access was possible.
