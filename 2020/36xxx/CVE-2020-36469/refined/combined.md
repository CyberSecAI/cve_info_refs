### Description

The `appendix` crate implements a key-value mapping data structure called
`Index<K, V>` that is stored on disk. The crate allows for any type to inhabit
the generic `K` and `V` type parameters and implements Send and Sync for them
unconditionally.

Using a type that is not marked as `Send` or `Sync` with `Index` can allow it
to be used across multiple threads leading to data races. Additionally using
reference types for the keys or values will lead to the segmentation faults
in the crate's code.

## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Nov 15, 2020](https://github.com/krl/appendix/issues/6#issue-743187175)

Hi there, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are scanning crates on crates.io for potential soundness bugs. We noticed that the `Index` object implements the `Send` and `Sync` traits for all types:

[appendix/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/krl/appendix/blob/b279bc230bfd5df4695c7a095f687d5c3a184e97/src/lib.rs#L61-L62)

Lines 61 to 62
in
[b279bc2](/krl/appendix/commit/b279bc230bfd5df4695c7a095f687d5c3a184e97)

|  | unsafe impl<K, V> Send for Index<K, V> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<K, V> Sync for Index<K, V> {} |

This should likely be bounded when both `K` and `V` are `Send` and `Sync` respectively, otherwise it makes it possible to send an `Index` object across threads containing non-Sendable types such as an `Rc` object or a `Cell`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
