{
  "vulnerability": {
    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenLDAP, a free implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. An unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of these flaws to cause a denial of service (slapd daemon crash, infinite loops) via specially crafted packets.",
    "affected_products": [
      "NetApp Cloud Backup",
      "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)",
      "NetApp SolidFire Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)",
      "macOS Mojave",
      "macOS Catalina",
      "macOS Big Sur",
       "Debian 9",
      "Debian 10"
     
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from logic errors in how OpenLDAP handles certain specially crafted packets, leading to a denial of service.",
    "vulnerability_details": [
      "An unauthenticated remote attacker can send specially crafted packets to trigger an infinite loop or crash the slapd daemon.",
      "Multiple vulnerabilities related to processing these packets exist within OpenLDAP.",
        "The issue was addressed with improved checks"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS), potentially rendering the service unavailable.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is remote, requiring the attacker to send specially crafted packets to the vulnerable OpenLDAP server.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can be remote. The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the affected server."
