The provided content details multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in CMS Made Simple version 2.2.14.

**Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization and output encoding. The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input before storing it in the database or displaying it in the user interface. Specifically, the application fails to HTML encode user input containing potentially malicious script tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Stored XSS:** Malicious scripts are stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected pages.
* **Reflected XSS:** Malicious scripts are injected through the URL and executed when the page is loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    * Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    * Redirecting users to malicious websites
    * Defacing the website
    * Performing unauthorized actions

**Attack Vectors:**
* The vulnerabilities can be exploited through various administrative interfaces:
    * **Manage Shortcuts:** Title field
    * **News Categories:** Name and Parent fields
    * **News Options:** Email address and subject fields
    * **Content Editing Settings:** Paths for image tags and thumbnails
    * **Admin Search:** Search Text field
    * **Maintenance Mode:** Excluded IPs field
    * **News Articles:** URL (slug) and Extra fields
    * **Design Manager Stylesheets:** Stylesheet Name field
    * **Design Manager Designs:** Design Name field

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* An authenticated user with administrative privileges is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.
* The attacker needs to have access to the CMS administration panel.

**Specific Vulnerability Details**

The report details nine separate XSS vulnerabilities. The following are some key points:

*   Multiple injection points exist within the CMS administrative interface.
*   Both stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities are present.
*   The provided payloads (`"><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>`, `"><img src onerror=alert("SonGohan22")>`) demonstrate how malicious code can be injected.
*   Some vulnerabilities only affect the submitting user, and the CMS developers have chosen not to fix them.
*   The vulnerabilities were reported by user "SonGohan".

**Resolution Status**
* Some vulnerabilities were fixed in later CMSMS versions. Specifically, vulnerabilities 2,3,4,6, and the "Extra" field of vulnerability 7 were fixed.
* Vulnerability 7's "Url slug" is not fixed and is noted as "value not accepted on submit".
* Vulnerabilities 1, 5, 8, and 9 were not fully fixed, as they "only address the user who exploits this vulnerability".
* CMSMS 2.2.15 has been released as of the date of the content.
