Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-36561:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper path sanitization within the `github.com/yi-ge/unzip` library when extracting files from a ZIP archive. Specifically, the library does not adequately validate file paths contained within the archive before writing them to the file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue, commonly referred to as "Zip Slip." This allows an attacker to craft a malicious ZIP archive containing file entries with relative paths (e.g., `../../evil.sh`). When extracted, these files can be written outside of the intended target directory, potentially overwriting existing files or creating new files in arbitrary locations.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The library lacks proper validation of the file paths extracted from the ZIP archive. This means it blindly concatenates the extracted file name with the destination directory without checking for relative path components that could lead to directory traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite existing files on the file system.
- **Remote Command Execution:** By overwriting executable files or configuration files, an attacker could achieve remote command execution. The attacker might either execute the overwritten files directly or wait for a system or user to invoke them.
- **Data Manipulation and Loss:** Overwriting configuration files or other sensitive resources can cause significant damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious ZIP Archive:** The attack vector involves providing a maliciously crafted ZIP archive to the vulnerable `unzip` library. This archive contains files with relative paths designed to break out of the target extraction directory.
- **Unzip Library Usage:** The vulnerability is triggered when a program or system uses the vulnerable `github.com/yi-ge/unzip` library to extract the malicious archive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Malicious Archives:** The attacker needs to be able to create ZIP archives with specially crafted file paths containing directory traversal sequences like `../`.
- **Ability to Trigger Extraction:** The attacker must be able to provide the malicious ZIP archive to a system or application that uses the vulnerable `github.com/yi-ge/unzip` library to extract it. This could be through various means, such as user uploads, network transfers, or other data input mechanisms.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attack does not require elevated privileges on the target system. The vulnerability exists because of a lack of sanitization in the library itself.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is specifically located within the `Unzip.Extract` function of the `github.com/yi-ge/unzip` package.
- The fix implemented in commit `2adbaa4891b9690853ef10216189189f5ad7dc73` addresses the vulnerability by adding a check to ensure that the extracted file paths remain within the target directory, using  `strings.HasPrefix` to validate that the path remains within the expected base directory.
- The vulnerability was identified and fixed as part of the "Zip Slip" vulnerability class.
- The vulnerable versions of the library are before `v1.0.3-0.20200308084313-2adbaa4891b9`.
