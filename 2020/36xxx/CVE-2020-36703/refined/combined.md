### Description

The Elementor Website Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG image uploads in versions up to, and including 2.9.7 This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with the upload\_files capability to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the page with the stored web scripts.

# WordPress Elementor plugin fixed SVG XSS protection bypass vulnerability.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [May 6, 2020 - 1:38pm [+0700]January 21, 2021 - 6:25pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-elementor-plugin-fixed-svg-xss-protection-bypass-vulnerability/)

The WordPress [Elementor Page Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/) plugin (4+ million installations), was prone to a broken access control vulnerability affecting version 2.9.7 and below that could lead to stored XSS vulnerability via SVG image upload.

### Authenticated SVG Uploads Activation

Elementor has an option to allow SVG uploads. It can be enabled from the “Settings > Advanced” tab:

![](../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/elementor-svg-uploads.png)

The `ajax_enable_svg_uploads` function used to activate the option lacks capability check and because it is called by the `handle_ajax_request` function which uses a shared security nonce, it is accessible to all logged-in users:

```
public function ajax_enable_svg_uploads() {
   update_option( 'elementor_allow_svg', 1 );
}

```

Any authenticated user can activate SVG uploads via the WordPress AJAX API.

### SVG Sanitizer Bypass & Authenticated Stored XSS

In WordPress, a user must have the `upload_files` capability in order to upload a file to the media library. Authors have such capability: they can upload files and edit their own posts but they aren’t allowed to insert potentially dangerous elements such as JavaScript code and various HTML tags into their posts. However, after enabling SVG uploads, an author could bypass those restrictions.

In the “elementor/core/files/assets/svg/svg-handler.php” script, the `sanitizer` method is used to load and sanitize the SVG file:

```
public function sanitizer( $content ) {
   ...
   ...
   $open_svg = $this->svg_dom->loadXML( $content );
   if ( ! $open_svg ) {
      return false;
   }

   $this->strip_doctype();
   $this->sanitize_elements();

```

Because an XML document is case-sensitive, the function loads the content of the file with `DOMDocument::loadXML` which, unlike `DOMDocument::loadHTML`, doesn’t convert all elements to lowercase. Then, it calls the `sanitize_elements` function:

```
const SCRIPT_REGEX = '/(?:\w+script|data):/xi';
..
..
private function sanitize_elements() {
   ...
   ...
   $href = $current_element->getAttribute( 'href' );
   if ( 1 === preg_match( self::SCRIPT_REGEX, $href ) ) {
      $current_element->removeAttribute( 'href' );
   }

```

The function performs several actions such as searching and removing JS code and data URI schemes from the `href` attribute. But because the `getAttribute` and `removeAttribute` functions perform a case-sensitive search, an author could bypass the verification by changing the attribute’s case to `HREF` or `hReF` for instance and, to bypass several additional checks in the plugin, could insert a specially crafted SVG file as a base64-encoded data URL, allowing the injection of JavaScript code into their post:

![](../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/elementor-svg-xss-protection-bypass.png)

Because the content of the encoded file won’t be sanitized, it is possible to insert plain JavaScript code or even HTML events such as `onmouseover` or `onmousemove` for instance.

### Additional Issues

Elementor attempts to remove PHP code and comments from uploaded files with two functions, `strip_php_tags` and `strip_comments`:

```
private function strip_php_tags( $string ) {
   $string = preg_replace( '/<\?(=|php)(.+?)\?>/i', '', $string );
   // Remove XML, ASP, etc.
   $string = preg_replace( '/<\?(.*)\?>/Us', '', $string );
   $string = preg_replace( '/<\%(.*)\%>/Us', '', $string );

   if ( ( false !== strpos( $string, '<?' ) ) || ( false !== strpos( $string, '<%' ) ) ) {
      return '';
   }
   return $string;
}

private function strip_comments( $string ) {
   // Remove comments.
   $string = preg_replace( '/<!--(.*)-->/Us', '', $string );
   $string = preg_replace( '/\/\*(.*)\*\//Us', '', $string );
   if ( ( false !== strpos( $string, '<!--' ) ) || ( false !== strpos( $string, '/*' ) ) ) {
      return '';
   }
   return $string;
}

```

However, they are called in the wrong order:

```
$content = $this->strip_php_tags( $content );
$content = $this->strip_comments( $content );

```

A user could obfuscate PHP code with a fake comment:

```
</* foo */?php echo "Hello World"; ?>
```

The `strip_php_tags` function would miss it but `strip_comments` would remove the comment and recreate the original PHP code:

```
<?php echo "Hello World"; ?>
```
### Recommendations

Update immediately if you have version 2.9.7 or below installed.

If you are using our premium web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/), you are protected against this type of vulnerabilities affecting SVG files.

### Timeline

The vulnerability was reported to the authors on April 14th, 2020 and a new version 2.9.8 was released on April 21st, 2020.
