Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a combination of a missing capability check when enabling SVG uploads and a case-sensitive bypass in the SVG sanitizer within the Elementor Website Builder plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The `ajax_enable_svg_uploads` function lacked a capability check, allowing any authenticated user to enable SVG uploads, regardless of their permissions.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The SVG sanitizer used case-sensitive functions (`getAttribute` and `removeAttribute`) to filter out malicious attributes like `href`. This allowed attackers to bypass the filters by changing the attribute's case (e.g., `HREF` or `hReF`).
*   **Incorrect order of sanitization**: PHP code could be obfuscated using a fake comment and the order of `strip_php_tags` and `strip_comments` would cause the PHP code to be restored after the comment is removed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  By uploading a crafted SVG file, an attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a page. This code would execute whenever a user accesses the affected page.
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers could execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **PHP code injection**: Due to the wrong order of sanitization, an attacker could insert obfuscated PHP code that would then be executed when the file is loaded.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SVG Upload:** The primary attack vector involves uploading a malicious SVG file through the Elementor plugin's SVG upload functionality, which must be enabled first.
*   **WordPress AJAX API**: The broken access control allows any authenticated user to enable SVG uploads using the WordPress AJAX API.
*   **Data URI scheme**: A specially crafted SVG file could be inserted as a base64-encoded data URL to bypass additional checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated WordPress User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in WordPress user, but does not require admin access, as an author or editor role with the `upload_files` capability would be enough.
*   **Access to Elementor Settings:** The attacker needs access to enable the SVG upload option in Elementorâ€™s settings (through the ajax call, which is accessible to all logged-in users) or otherwise exploit it if already enabled.
*   **Ability to Upload Files:**  The attacker needs the capability to upload files to the WordPress media library.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affected Elementor Website Builder versions up to and including 2.9.7.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.9.8.
*   The content provides more detail than the standard CVE description.
