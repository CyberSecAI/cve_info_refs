Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-36705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Adning Advertising plugin for WordPress had a flaw in the `_ning_upload_image` function, which lacked proper file type validation. This allowed for unrestricted file uploads. Additionally, the `_ning_remove_image` function lacked authorization checks, enabling arbitrary file deletion via path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unrestricted File Upload:** The `_ning_upload_image` function did not properly validate file types, allowing the upload of any file, including malicious ones. The plugin allowed the user to specify allowed file types, which an attacker could manipulate.
2.  **Missing Access Control:** The AJAX actions `_ning_upload_image` and `_ning_remove_image` were accessible to unauthenticated users via the `nopriv_` hook. These functions lacked capability checks and nonce verification.
3.  **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The `_ning_remove_image` function did not validate or sanitize the file path, allowing for path traversal and deletion of arbitrary files, including critical ones like `wp-config.php`.
4.  **Directory Creation:** The plugin would create the upload directory if it didn't exist, based on user-supplied data, which attackers could exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading malicious PHP files, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full site takeover.
2.  **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker could delete any file on the server that the web server user had access to. Deleting `wp-config.php` would effectively reset the site, allowing the attacker to control it.
3.  **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could upload malicious or unwanted content, and they could modify the site by deleting legitimate files.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Unauthenticated File Upload:** Sending a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `_ning_upload_image`, along with malicious file and manipulated allowed file types.
2.  **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion:** Sending a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `_ning_remove_image`, along with manipulated `uid` and `src` parameters for path traversal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers did not need any prior access or login credentials.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers needed to send POST requests to the target website.
*   **Understanding of WordPress AJAX:**  Attackers needed to understand how WordPress AJAX actions work to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild.
*   The plugin author released a patched version (1.5.6) to address these issues.
*   Wordfence Premium users received a firewall rule to protect against these vulnerabilities before it was publicly disclosed, while free users received it later.
*   The vulnerability could be exploited by directly uploading PHP files or by uploading a ZIP archive containing PHP files, which would then be extracted on the server.
*  The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8 (Wordfence) and 10 (WPScan).
