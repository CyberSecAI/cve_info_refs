The `unflatten` function contains a [prototype pollution](https://github.com/Kirill89/prototype-pollution-explained) vulnerability. I've added a test and fix.

I've tested back to 1.0.0 and all versions are vulnerable.

This fixes [#105](https://github.com/hughsk/flat/issues/105) .

Sorry, something went wrong.

| So our group fails builds if they have a certain SYNK threshold package in them. The SYNK says latest fixed version is 4.1.2 so a build with 4.1.1 doesn't meet the criteria. Can either 4.1.2 be published for this or SYNK corrected? |
