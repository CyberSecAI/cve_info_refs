- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization in the "Teams" feature of the LavaLite CMS. Specifically, the application fails to properly encode user-supplied input before rendering it back to the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application attempts to remove script tags but fails to prevent XSS through other means, such as `svg/onload` attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Teams" feature, which is then executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected page. This can lead to the attacker transmitting private data (e.g., cookies), redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing other malicious actions within the user's browser session under the guise of the vulnerable website.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker must be an authenticated user.
    - The attacker navigates to the "Teams" feature (/admin/user/team).
    - The attacker injects malicious code, such as `<svg/on<script><script>load=alert(/XSS/)//</script>`, into the input field.
    - When other users view the preview or the affected page, the injected script executes in their browsers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must have an account and be logged into the LavaLite CMS.
    - The attacker must have access to the "Teams" feature within the CMS.
