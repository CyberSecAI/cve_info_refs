The provided content is related to CVE-2020-36660.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing access control checks on the `/api/user/<id>` and `/api/group/<id>` routes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate authorization checks. The API endpoints allowed access to user and group details without proper authentication or authorization checks, which could be exploited by any user.
- Information Disclosure:  User information, including group memberships, admin status, permissions, associated SRP requests (including character names), and authentication source/ID were exposed. Group information, including group names, permissions, and members, was also disclosed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized users could enumerate all users and groups within the system.
- Sensitive information about users and groups was exposed, including personal information, association with groups, permissions and submitted requests.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct access to the vulnerable API endpoints `/api/user/<id>` and `/api/group/<id>`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No special privileges were required, only access to the application. Any user, even unauthenticated, could access the API and extract the information.
