Security Vuln: Check API access to entity details

```
Access through the /api/user/<id> and /api/group/<id> routes were not
properly being checked. This meant that anyone could easily enumerate
users and groups.

User information disclosed would include which SRP groups a user is
in, whether they are an admin, which permissions a user has been
granted, as well as the details for every SRP request that user has
submitted, including the character name for the loss. The authentication
source (Test Auth, EVE SSO, etc) for the user would also be disclosed
through the requests, along with the ID associated with that
authentication method.

Group information disclosed would include the group name, permissions
granted within that group, as well as all members of the group.

v0.12.2 is going to be released shortly addressing this vulnerability.
A large thank you to the individual who brought this to my attention.
