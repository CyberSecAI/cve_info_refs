# Bunch unconditionally implements Send/Sync
Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implements `Send`/`Sync` for `Bunch`.
This allows users to insert `T: !Sync` to `Bunch`. It is possible to create a data race to a `T: !Sync` by invoking the `Bunch::get()` API (which returns `&T`) from multiple threads. It is also possible to send `T: !Send` to other threads by inserting `T` inside `Bunch` and sending `Bunch` to another thread, allowing to create a data race by inserting types like `T = Rc<\_>`.
Such data races can lead to memory corruption.

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implements `Send`/`Sync` for `Bunch<T>`.
This allows users to insert `T: !Sync` to `Bunch<T>`. It is possible to create a data race to a `T: !Sync` by invoking the `Bunch::get()` API (which returns `&T`) from multiple threads. It is also possible to send `T: !Send` to other threads by inserting `T` inside `Bunch<T>` and sending `Bunch<T>` to another thread, allowing to create a data race by inserting types like `T = Rc<_>`.

Such data races can lead to memory corruption.

## Description

An issue was discovered in the bunch crate through 2020-11-12 for Rust.

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implements `Send`/`Sync` for `Bunch<T>`.

This allows users to insert `T: !Sync` to `Bunch<T>`. It is possible to create a data race to a `T: !Sync` by invoking the `Bunch::get()` API (which returns `&T`) from multiple threads. It is also possible to send `T: !Send` to other threads by inserting `T` inside `Bunch<T>` and sending `Bunch<T>` to another thread, allowing to create a data race by inserting types like `T = Rc<_>`.

Such data races can lead to memory corruption.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@JOE1994](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10286488?u=b10074df08a0e21e9483938c26612ad8e9dfec4b&v=4&size=48)[JOE1994](https://github.com/JOE1994)opened [on Nov 12, 2020](https://github.com/krl/bunch/issues/1#issue-741570082)

Hello 🦀 ,

Currently in the `Sync` impl for `Bunch<T>`, there is no `Sync` bound on `T`.

With that, it's possible to write code that causes undefined behavior when `Bunch` is used from multiple threads.

[bunch/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/krl/bunch/blob/2623f9a1c1ed1f00c37d7f639b715b8cb239eeb8/src/lib.rs#L36)

Line 36
in
[2623f9a](/krl/bunch/commit/2623f9a1c1ed1f00c37d7f639b715b8cb239eeb8)

|  | unsafe impl<T> Sync for Bunch<T> {} |
| --- | --- |

Below is a small & contrived proof-of-concept, where a segmentation fault can occur due to data race.

Running the example code below in Debug mode results in a segmentation fault.

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use bunch::Bunch;
use std::cell::Cell;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

// A simple tagged union used to demonstrate problems with data races in Cell.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum RefOrInt<'a> {
    Ref(&'a u64),
    Int(u64),
}
static X: u64 = 0;

fn main() {
    let bunch = Bunch::new();
    // This item is not `Sync`, but yet can be pushed to `Bunch`.
    let item_not_sync = Cell::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&X));
    bunch.push(item_not_sync);

    let arc_0 = Arc::new(bunch);
    let arc_1 = Arc::clone(&arc_0);

    let _child = thread::spawn(move || {
        let smuggled_cell = arc_1.get(0);

        loop {
            smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
            smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&X))
        }
    });

    loop {
        if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = arc_0.get(0).get() {
            if addr as *const _ as usize != 0xdeadbeef {
                continue;
            }
            // Due to the data race, obtaining Ref(0xdeadbeef) is possible
            println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
            println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
        }
    }
}
```

I think this issue can be resolved by adding a `T: Sync` bound to `unsafe impl<T> Sync for Bunch<T> {}`.
