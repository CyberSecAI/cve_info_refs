Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36557:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a use-after-free that occurs when the `VT_DISALLOCATE` ioctl frees a virtual console while `tty_release()` is still running.
- The `VT_DISALLOCATE` operation incorrectly considers a virtual console's `struct vc_data` as unused as soon as the corresponding tty's reference count reaches zero. However, the tty might still be in the process of being closed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability in `con_shutdown()`, triggered when a virtual console is freed prematurely while it is still being used during the closing process.
- **Incorrect Reference Counting:** The `struct vc_data` was not properly reference-counted, causing it to be freed too early.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Kernel Crash:** The use-after-free leads to a kernel crash as indicated by the KASAN report.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, use-after-free vulnerabilities can potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution under certain circumstances although this is not described in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **`VT_DISALLOCATE` ioctl:** The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `VT_DISALLOCATE` ioctl on a virtual console.
- **Race Condition:** Exploitation depends on a race condition between the `VT_DISALLOCATE` call and the closing of the tty.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to open tty devices and issue ioctl commands.
- **Ability to Trigger the Race:** The attacker must be able to open and close tty devices rapidly, while also issuing the `VT_DISALLOCATE` ioctl to trigger the race condition. The provided reproducer code shows the necessary steps.

**More Detail than CVE:**

- The provided information includes a code-level explanation of the vulnerability and the fix, a reproducer program, and a KASAN report showing the crash. This level of detail is more extensive than a typical CVE description. The fix uses tty_port reference counting to prevent the race.
- The text also describes the fix applied in commit `ca4463bf8438b403596edd0ec961ca0d4fbe0220`. The fix involved making `vc_data` reference-counted using the embedded `struct tty_port`. The reference count is incremented on opening the console, and decremented when closing it, or by `VT_DISALLOCATE`, preventing the race condition.

The provided information clearly relates to the specified CVE, providing a detailed explanation of the root cause, vulnerability, impact, attack vector, required capabilities, and fix.
