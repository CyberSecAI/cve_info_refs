- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The DedeCMS v5.7 SP2 web application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in several parameters before including it in the HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code into the web page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in the `filename`, `mid`, `userid`, and `templet` parameters of the `tpl.php`, `mychannel_edit.php`, `file_manage_view.php`, `sys_admin_user_edit.php`, and `makehtml_homepage.php` files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent redirects to malicious sources, and non-persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is non-persistent, utilizing GET requests to inject malicious scripts into vulnerable parameters. The attacker manipulates the request parameters with malicious script code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any prior authentication or privileges. The vulnerability can be exploited with low user interaction.
