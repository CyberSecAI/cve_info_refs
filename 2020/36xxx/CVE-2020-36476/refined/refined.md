- Root cause of vulnerability:
  - When checking X.509 CRLs, a certificate was only considered as revoked if its revocationDate was in the past according to the local clock if available.
  - On builds without MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE, certificates were never considered as revoked.
  - On builds with MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE, an attacker able to control the local clock could prevent revocation of certificates via CRLs.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Incorrect handling of revocationDate field in X.509 CRLs.
  - Vulnerability to time-based attacks where the attacker manipulates the local clock.
  - Inconsistency in certificate revocation checks based on MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE configuration.

- Impact of exploitation:
  - An attacker can bypass certificate revocation checks.
  - Allows for the use of revoked certificates, potentially leading to unauthorized access.

- Attack vectors:
  - Manipulation of the local system clock to bypass revocation checks (when MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE is enabled).
  - Exploiting the lack of revocation checks when MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE is disabled.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - The attacker needs to be in a position to manipulate the local clock (when MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE is enabled).
  - The attacker can also exploit the vulnerability if MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE is disabled, requiring no special capabilities.
