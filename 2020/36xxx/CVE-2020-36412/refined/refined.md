The provided content describes multiple stored and reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in CMS Made Simple version 2.2.14.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database or reflecting it back in the web page. Specifically, the application does not HTML entity encode user input, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious script is stored in the database and executed when a user views the affected page.
- Reflected XSS: Malicious script is reflected back to the user from the server as part of the HTTP response, without proper sanitization.
The vulnerabilities occur in various features:
    1.  "Manage Shortcuts"
    2.  "Categories" via "Settings - New Module"
    3.  "Options" via "Settings - New Module"
    4.  "Content Editing Settings" via "Settings - Global Settings"
    5.  "Admin Search" via "Extensions"
    6.  "Maintenance Mode" via "Settings - Global Settings"
    7.  "News" via "Content"
    8.  "Design Manager" via "Layout" (Stylesheets)
    9.  "Design Manager" via "Layout" (Designs)
**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
- Transmitting private data (e.g., cookies, session information) to the attacker.
- Redirecting the victim to attacker-controlled content.
- Performing malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the vulnerable input fields of different features of the CMS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have an authenticated user account with the necessary privileges to access the vulnerable features (admin panel).
- The attacker needs to be able to access the web administration panel.
- In the case of stored XSS, the attacker stores the malicious payload, and any user accessing the affected page will trigger the XSS.
- In the case of reflected XSS, the attacker needs to convince a user to access the specifically crafted URL that contains the malicious payload
