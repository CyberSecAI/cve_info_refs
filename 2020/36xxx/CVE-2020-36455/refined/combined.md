Affected versions of this crate allows sending non-Send types to other threads,
which can lead to data races and memory corruption due to the data race.

## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Nov 17, 2020](https://github.com/BrokenLamp/slock-rs/issues/2#issue-744461343)

Hi there, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are scanning crates on crates.io for potential soundness bugs. We noticed that `Slock` implements `Send` and `Sync` for all types:

[slock-rs/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/BrokenLamp/slock-rs/blob/301f598fbbea005bd07b12f2e31abf2e47ddd3c9/src/lib.rs#L268-L269)

Lines 268 to 269
in
[301f598](/BrokenLamp/slock-rs/commit/301f598fbbea005bd07b12f2e31abf2e47ddd3c9)

|  | unsafe impl<T> Send for Slock<T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<T> Sync for Slock<T> {} |

This should probably be bounded by `T: Send` just like the [standard library's Mutex](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html), otherwise this allows sending non-Send types across thread boundaries which may invoke undefined behavior.

Here's an example of this in action with an `Rc` segfaulting safe Rust code. Built with `futures 0.3.8` with `thread-pool` feature enabled:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use slock::Slock;

use std::rc::Rc;
use futures::executor::ThreadPool;

fn main() {
    let rc = Rc::new(());
    let lock = Slock::new(rc);
    let another_lock = lock.split();

    let fut1 = async move {
        let rc = lock.get_clone().await;
        println!("Future 1 - {:p}", rc);

        // Race the un-synchronized refcount in the RCs.
        for _ in 0..100_000_000 {
            rc.clone();
        }
    };
    let fut2 = async move {
        let rc = another_lock.get_clone().await;
        println!("Future 2 - {:p}", rc);

        for _ in 0..100_000_000 {
            rc.clone();
        }
    };

    let mut pool = ThreadPool::new().unwrap();
    pool.spawn_ok(fut1);
    pool.spawn_ok(fut2);
    // Give the pool time to complete its tasks.
    loop {}
}
```

This outputs:

```
Future 1 - 0x561c3cd6ba50
Future 2 - 0x561c3cd6ba50

Return Code: -4 (SIGILL)

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
