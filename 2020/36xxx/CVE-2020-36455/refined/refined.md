Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36455:

**Root Cause:**

The `slock` crate incorrectly implements `Send` and `Sync` traits for its `Slock<T>` type, without requiring that the contained type `T` also implements `Send`. This allows non-`Send` types to be moved across thread boundaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect `Send`/`Sync` implementation:** The `Slock<T>` type unconditionally implements the `Send` and `Sync` traits, regardless of whether `T` is `Send`. These traits are fundamental in Rust for ensuring that data can be safely transferred and accessed across threads.
- **Data Races:**  Because of the incorrect `Send`/`Sync` implementation, it's possible to send non-`Send` types across threads which may lead to data races when multiple threads try to access and modify the same data concurrently without proper synchronization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** Data races resulting from the vulnerability can lead to memory corruption due to unsynchronized access to shared mutable data.
- **Undefined Behavior:**  The memory corruption from data races invokes undefined behavior which can manifest as crashes (segfaults).
- **Violation of Rust's Memory Safety:** The vulnerability allows the violation of Rust's memory safety guarantees even when using safe code, undermining the core principle of preventing undefined behavior

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Multi-threaded Applications:** Any application using the `slock` crate with a non-Send type in a multi-threaded environment is vulnerable.
- **Sending Non-Send Types**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a non-Send type to another thread using `Slock<T>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to control/supply type T:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a non-Send type as the type argument `T` to the `Slock<T>` struct.
- **Multithreaded environment:** Exploitation requires the attacker to use the vulnerable `Slock<T>` in a multithreaded environment.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by the Rust group @sslab-gatech.
- The issue was fixed in version 0.2.0 of the crate.
- An example using `Rc` is provided that triggers a segfault.
- The advisory also includes aliases for the vulnerability, including GHSA-83r8-p8v6-6gfm, and GHSA-mc36-5m36-hjh5.
