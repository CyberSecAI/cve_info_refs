### @defunctl **[defunctl](/defunctl)** commented [Feb 5, 2020](#issue-560690843)

Pretty serious XSS after WordPress changed the way LIKE queries work a while back. Tested a few sites with panels enabled and using the default WordPress search.

<https://site.com/?s=test('hi')>

```
WordPress database error: [You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near '\'hi\')%'))) AND wp_posts.post_type IN ('post', 'page', 'attachment') AND (wp_p' at line 1]
SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS wp_posts.ID FROM wp_posts WHERE 1=1 AND (((wp_posts.post_title LIKE '%test(\'hi\')%') OR (wp_posts.post_excerpt LIKE '%test(\'hi\')%') OR (wp_posts.post_content LIKE '%test(\'hi\') OR (wp_posts.post_content_filtered LIKE '%test(\'hi\')%'))) AND wp_posts.post_type IN ('post', 'page', 'attachment') AND (wp_posts.post_status = 'publish' OR wp_posts.post_status = 'acf-disabled' OR wp_posts.post_author = 35 AND wp_posts.post_status = 'private') ORDER BY wp_posts.post_title LIKE '%test(\'hi\')%' DESC, wp_posts.post_date DESC LIMIT 0, 9

```

Sorry, something went wrong.
