Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36670:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-36670

**Description:** The NEX-Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure and modification of data due to missing capability checks on several AJAX actions. This allows authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or higher to invoke these functions. These functions could be used to modify form submission records, delete files, send test emails, and modify plugin settings.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Missing authorization checks on multiple AJAX actions within the NEX-Forms WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The core vulnerability lies in the absence of proper capability checks when handling AJAX requests. This allows users with insufficient privileges to access and execute administrative functions.
*   **Insecure Direct Object References:** (Implied) The ability to modify form submission records, delete files, and modify plugin settings through these AJAX actions suggests a lack of proper validation and authorization on the resources being accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially view sensitive form submission data.
*  **Data Modification:** Attackers could modify or delete form submission data and files, leading to data integrity issues.
*   **System Compromise:** By modifying plugin settings and sending test emails, attackers may be able to further compromise the WordPress site or use it as a vector for sending spam or phishing emails.
*   **Loss of Functionality:** Modifying plugin settings or deleting data could disrupt the normal operation of the plugin and potentially the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network using HTTP requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoints.
*   **AJAX Requests:** Attackers craft malicious AJAX requests to trigger the vulnerable functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the affected WordPress site, though it can be as low as a subscriber level account.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoints:** The attacker must be aware of the specific AJAX actions that are missing authorization checks.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content includes a link to the specific commit that fixed the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Chloe Chamberland from Wordfence.
* The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 6.3.
