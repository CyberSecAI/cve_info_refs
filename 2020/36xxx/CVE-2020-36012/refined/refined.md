Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the provided Medium article:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "Add Customer" feature of the M-Store Multi-Store Inventory Management System. Specifically, the application fails to neutralize or encode HTML special characters in fields such as "Customer Name", "Address", and "Business Address".
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores unsanitized user input which results in stored XSS. This means that a malicious payload injected by an attacker will be persistently stored in the database.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when the stored malicious data is accessed by users of the application. This could lead to session hijacking, phishing attacks, data theft, or complete compromise of the application for the victim.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the "Add Customer" form accessible to authenticated users (Super Admin).
    *   The attacker injects the malicious payload in the form fields.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have valid Super Admin credentials to access the vulnerable "Add Customer" feature.
    *   No other specific positioning is required.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker injects the following payload into the "Customer Name", "Address", and "Business Address" fields: `"><img src onerror=alert(1)>`
*   When this customer data is viewed or processed, the injected JavaScript payload `alert(1)` is executed, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The article indicates the affected version is 1.0, and it's not patched.
*   The software link is provided, linking directly to the product page at Codecanyon.
