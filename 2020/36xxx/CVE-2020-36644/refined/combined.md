This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Escape filename to avoid XSS from malicious input

[Browse files](/jamesmartin/inline_svg/tree/f5363b351508486021f99e083c92068cf2943621)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
Because:

* If user input is provided for the file name (as in rendering an SVG
  based on a URL parameter), the blanket marking of the SVG output as
  HTML-safe exposes an app to an XSS attack in the comment listing the
  file that was not found.

Solution:

* HTML-escape the filename rendering the comment that it was not found.
```

* Loading branch information

### @pbyrne **[pbyrne](/pbyrne)** commented [Mar 3, 2020](#issue-574802069)

Because:

* If user input is provided for the file name (as in rendering an SVG based on a URL parameter), the blanket marking of the SVG output as HTML-safe exposes an app to an XSS attack in the comment listing the file that was not found.
* This happened in our app, which we resolved by adding a whitelist to check if the SVG file existed before calling `inline_svg`, but it feels safer to have the gem handle this better from the get-go.

Solution:

* HTML-escape the filename rendering the comment that it was not found.
* I considered some alternate solutions like using `content_tag` to render the SVG rather than a raw string, but this felt like a smaller change.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### **[jamesmartin](/jamesmartin)** commented [Mar 23, 2020](#issuecomment-602368824)

| Actually, it looks like your change isn't backwards compatible with [Rails 3](https://github.com/jamesmartin/inline_svg/runs/526433353?check_suite_focus=true#step:12:87):  ``` ActionView::Template::Error: undefined method `html_escape_once' for ERB::Util:Module 89   Did you mean?  html_escape  ```  We'll probably need a conditional to check for that. The good news is that we'll be dropping Rails 3 support in Version 2 of this gem, but for now we've got to support it. |
