***Tip:** You can search by CVE ID, software name or slug, or the researcher name. Expand to read about more advanced search options.*

If you want to perform more advanced lookups, you can use **keywords** to further refine your search.

For example, `woocommerce researcher:"chloe chamberland"` would search for any vulnerabilities discovered by Chloe Chamberland in software that has WooCommerce in the title.

Keywords are added in `keyword:value` format. If the value contains spaces, you must enclose it in quotation marks.

You can use the following keywords to add criteria to your search:

title
Searches through the title of each vulnerability for matches.

date
Returns vulnerabilities by publication date. Use `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY` format.

cvss-rating
Use `low`, `medium`, `high` or `critical` to limit the search to vulnerabilities with the specified rating.

researcher
Returns vulnerabilities credited to researchers containing the given text.

software
Returns vulnerabilities discovered in software containing the given text.

software-slug
Returns vulnerabilities discovered in software exactly matching the given slug.

software-type
Use `plugin`, `theme` or `core` to limit the search to the specified type of software.

By selecting “Search” you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the Wordfence Intelligence Terms and Conditions.

### Description

The JetBackup – WP Backup, Migrate & Restore plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.3.9. This is due to missing nonce validation on the backup\_guard\_get\_import\_backup() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files to the vulnerable site's server via a forged request, granted they can trick a site's administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
