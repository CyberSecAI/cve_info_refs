Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36669:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing nonce validation in the `backup_guard_get_import_backup()` function within the JetBackup â€“ WP Backup, Migrate & Restore WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary weakness is the lack of nonce validation, which makes the function susceptible to CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker to forge requests and trick a site administrator into unknowingly performing malicious actions.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The missing nonce validation allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload any type of file to the vulnerable WordPress site. This can lead to various malicious outcomes, including:
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** Uploading a malicious PHP file could grant the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Website Defacement/Manipulation:** Attackers could upload files that modify the site's content or redirect users to malicious sites.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Uploading scripts for data exfiltration.
*   **Site Compromise:** By successfully uploading malicious files the attacker could gain full control of the website

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Forged Request:** The attacker creates a malicious request targeting the vulnerable `backup_guard_get_import_backup()` function.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker tricks a logged-in administrator into performing an action (like clicking a link) that triggers the forged request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to initiate the attack.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator to execute the malicious request.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send the forged request over the network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in JetBackup plugin versions up to and including 1.3.9.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.4.0 by adding nonce validation to the affected function.
* The provided changeset shows how the nonce check was added.
* The Wordfence analysis provides a CVSS score of 8.8 (High).
