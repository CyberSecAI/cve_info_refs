## Description

![@SYM01](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33443792?u=89cc4856c5af3a2a060afa68401aedb564a79d46&v=4&size=48)[SYM01](https://github.com/SYM01)opened [on Mar 5, 2019](https://github.com/revel/revel/issues/1424#issue-417186011)

Once the [slices parameter](https://revel.github.io/manual/parameters.html#slices) feature is used, the website will be suffering from DoS attack.

When we need to get a slice parameter, we may use the following code snippet in our controller.

```
func (c App) DoS1(name []string) revel.Result {
	return c.RenderText(fmt.Sprint(name))
}

func (c App) DoS2() revel.Result {
	var name []string
	c.Params.Bind(&name, "name")
	return c.RenderText(fmt.Sprint(name))
}
```

It looks like everything is OK. However, we can exhaust the server's MEM with only one request.

e.g., when simply visit `http://localhost:9000/dos1?name[1234567890]=1`, the server's CPU and memory usage will soar, and the OOM killer will be triggered eventually.

This vulnerability was caused by the following code:

[revel/binder.go](https://github.com/revel/revel/blob/a3d7a7c23ca885cc5036d3641ede49ce4a14ee2e/binder.go#L210-L277)

| --- | --- |
|  | // Collect an array of slice elements with their indexes (and the max index). |

|  | index := -1 |
|  | leftBracket, rightBracket := len(name), strings.Index(key[len(name):], "]")+len(name) |
|  | if rightBracket > leftBracket+1 { |
|  | index, \_ = strconv.Atoi(key[leftBracket+1 : rightBracket]) |
|  | } |
|  | subKeyIndex := rightBracket + 1 |
|  |  |

|  | }) |
|  | return |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | // It's an un-indexed element. (e.g. element[]) |
|  | numNoIndex += len(vals) + len(files) |
|  | for \_, val := range vals { |
|  | // Unindexed values can only be direct-bound. |
|  | sliceValues = append(sliceValues, sliceValue{ |
|  | index: -1, |
|  | value: BindValue(val, typ.Elem()), |
|  | }) |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | for \_, fileHeader := range files { |
|  | sliceValues = append(sliceValues, sliceValue{ |
|  | index: -1, |
|  | value: BindFile(fileHeader, typ.Elem()), |
|  | }) |
|  | } |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | for key, vals := range params.Values { |
|  | processElement(key, vals, nil) |
|  | } |
|  | for key, fileHeaders := range params.Files { |
|  | processElement(key, nil, fileHeaders) |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | resultArray := reflect.MakeSlice(typ, maxIndex+1, maxIndex+1+numNoIndex) |
|  | for \_, sv := range sliceValues { |
|  | if sv.index != -1 { |
|  | resultArray.Index(sv.index).Set(sv.value) |
|  | } else { |
|  | resultArray = reflect.Append(resultArray, sv.value) |
|  | } |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | return resultArray |
|  | } |

When the function above is invoked, Revel will calc the `maxIndex` from user's input, and thus the attacker could make the `maxIndex` as large as possible. When `reflect.MakeSlice` is called, Golang will alloc a large memory as the `maxIndex` needed.

A possible solution for this vuln is to specify the upper bound of the `maxIndex` in the code or config file.

Before the problem is fixed, plz avoid using the slices parameter feature.

# The Go Language Collective is no longer active.

Collectives™ on Stack Overflow is a new offering in beta release. Currently a Collective requires participation from
a sponsoring organization, so in some cases a Collective may be decommissioned when the sponsorship ends. All questions and
answers that comprised a Collective remain accessible.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
