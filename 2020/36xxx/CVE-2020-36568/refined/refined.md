Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `bindSlice` function in the Revel framework's `binder.go` file. This function is responsible for binding request parameters to slice types. It dynamically calculates the maximum index (`maxIndex`) from user-provided input without proper validation or limits. This calculated `maxIndex` is then used to create a slice using `reflect.MakeSlice`. An attacker can manipulate the input to specify an extremely large index, leading to excessive memory allocation, causing a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unbounded Resource Allocation:** The primary weakness is the lack of an upper bound or validation on the maximum index used when creating a slice. This allows an attacker to force the server to allocate an arbitrary amount of memory.
- **Missing Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability also exposes a failure to properly sanitize user-controlled input to prevent the allocation of excessive resources.
- **Insecure Parameter Binding:** The slice parameter binding mechanism lacks proper security considerations leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a crafted request with a large slice index, an attacker can cause the server to exhaust its memory resources. This leads to a crash due to an out-of-memory error, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
- **System Instability:** The excessive memory allocation can cause the entire system to become unstable, possibly leading to other issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating parameters in an HTTP request, specifically by supplying a large index within a slice parameter.
- **Network Attack:** The attack can be launched remotely via the network, requiring no special access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the server.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and how to manipulate query parameters.
- **No Authentication:** The attack does not require any authentication or special privileges. It can be performed anonymously.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in `revel/binder.go` within the `bindSlice` function.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the application uses slice parameters and the framework processes the request.
- The fix involves introducing a configuration parameter `params.max_index` to limit the maximum allowed index, preventing arbitrary memory allocation.
- The fix was implemented in commit `d160ecb72207824005b19778594cbdc272e8a605` and merged through pull request #1427.
- The CVE identifier associated with this vulnerability is CVE-2020-36568.
- The vulnerability is also tracked under the alias GHSA-hggr-p7v6-73p5 and GO-2020-0003 in the Go vulnerability database.
