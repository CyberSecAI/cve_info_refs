Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the "Roles & Permissions" feature of the LavaLite CMS. Specifically, the application is not adequately handling user-supplied input when creating new roles.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored within the application's database and executed when a user views the affected data.
- The vulnerability exists because the application attempts to remove script tags, but this is not a sufficient measure to prevent XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Transmitting private data (e.g., cookies, session information) to the attacker.
    - Redirecting the victim to attacker-controlled web content.
    - Performing malicious actions on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.
    - Potential account compromise for users who view the malicious content.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Roles & Permissions" feature, specifically when creating or editing roles.
- A malicious, authenticated user can inject a malicious payload into the role name field.
- The injected script will be executed when an administrator views the list of roles.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the CMS.
- They need access to the "Roles & Permissions" feature (presumably with the ability to create or modify roles).

**Technical details:**
- The attacker inserts an SVG tag with an `onload` event containing Javascript code. The provided example payloads are:
   - `<svg/on<script><script>load=alert('XSS')//</script>`
   - `// # "><svg/onload=prompt('XSS')>`
- These payloads demonstrate that basic script tag removal is not an effective countermeasure against XSS. HTML entity encoding is required.
