{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a stack-use-after-return in the `solidity::smtutil::CHCSmtLib2Interface::querySolver` function, triggered through `solidity::smtutil::CHCSmtLib2Interface::query` and then `solidity::frontend::CHC::query`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-use-after-return",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Crash (READ 8 bytes)",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the execution of the `querySolver` function within the solidity compiler's SMT interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to provide input to the solidity compiler that would cause the vulnerable function to be called during compilation."
