Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `tpl_app.php` and `tpl_info.php` files. Specifically, the application is taking a `cate_id` parameter from the URL and directly outputting it into the HTML without encoding or sanitizing it. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The malicious script is included in the URL, the server renders the page, and the client executes the script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can be used for various malicious activities, such as:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies.
    *   **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the visual appearance of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a URL with a malicious script in the `cate_id` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking the malicious link, possibly through phishing emails or embedding the link on other websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create malicious URLs:** The attacker must be able to craft the URL containing the malicious script.
*   **Ability to deliver the malicious URL:** The attacker needs to deliver the URL to the victim, which may require some level of social engineering.
*   **Victim must be logged in:** The description indicates the affected code is within the admin panel, meaning the attacker would have to target logged in administrator users

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in `/dawn/templates/tpl_app.php` and `/dawn/templates/tpl_info.php`.
*   The provided payload is: `/dawn/templates/tpl_info.php?cate_id=ddddhm); });</script><script>alert(1);</script>`
*   The attacker noted there are likely other files with the same issue.
