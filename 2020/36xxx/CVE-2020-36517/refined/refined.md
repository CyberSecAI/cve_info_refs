Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-36517:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the hardcoded use of Cloudflare's DNS servers (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1) as fallback resolvers in the Home Assistant OS DNS plugin (CoreDNS). This occurs when the user's specified DNS server fails to resolve a domain, or returns specific errors. The plugin will then attempt to use Cloudflare's DNS servers, potentially leaking private hostnames to a third-party service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privacy Leakage:** Internal hostnames are exposed to Cloudflare's DNS servers when the configured local DNS server fails or does not have the requested entry.
*   **Hardcoded Fallback:** The DNS plugin has a hardcoded fallback to Cloudflare DNS which cannot be disabled through configuration options.
*   **Unintended DNS Resolution:** The system may use Cloudflare even when a local DNS server is configured, leading to unexpected DNS resolution.
*   **Performance Issues:** The constant attempts to connect to Cloudflare DNS servers (especially via DoT/TLS) when the connection is blocked or fails can slow down or even overload the Home Assistant system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** Internal network information, specifically hostnames, is disclosed to a third-party service (Cloudflare).
*   **Unexpected Behavior**: DNS resolution may not work as intended by the user, particularly for local devices or services.
*   **System Instability:**  In cases where the fallback DNS is unreachable, repeated failed connection attempts may cause performance issues on resource constrained devices, potentially leading to system instability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **DNS Resolution Failures:**  If the user configured local DNS fails to resolve a domain or returns a `SERVFAIL` or `NXDOMAIN`, the system will attempt to use the fallback servers.
*   **Firewall Blocking:** Blocking access to Cloudflare's DNS servers may lead to a cascade of connection attempts, as the system repeatedly tries to reach the fallback DNS. This can also cause high CPU usage on lower power devices.
*   **Use of Local Hostnames:** Using local hostnames in the Home Assistant configuration makes the system susceptible to leaking those hostnames to Cloudflare if the local DNS is not functioning correctly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   No specific attacker capabilities are needed. The "attack" is a side-effect of normal DNS resolution processes within Home Assistant OS.
*   No specific attacker position is needed as the vulnerability is inherent in how the software is configured.
*   The user simply needs to have local hostnames configured which are either not resolvable or have specific errors in the DNS server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue also highlighted that the CoreDNS plugin does not follow standard DNS practices, as normal systems will not attempt to failover to hardcoded DNS servers, but will instead return an error if a resolution is not possible with the user configured DNS.

*   Several attempts were made to fix this behavior in pull requests, but they were closed/rejected by maintainers who prefer the current behavior, and consider the current behavior a feature which cannot be easily turned off without marking a system "unsupported".

*   The issue is exacerbated by the use of DoT (DNS over TLS), which causes a performance hit on low powered devices. A change to UDP was proposed but rejected.

*   While the issues mention a CVE, the CVE ID is not explicitly linked or described, but it can be deduced that the vulnerability is about privacy leaks through unintended DNS queries.
