Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the `update_layout` function within the Avada theme's Fusion Builder plugin. This function is used to update the content of `fusion_element` or `fusion_template` post types. The code doesn't properly validate user capabilities to edit the posts nor verify if the post type is the expected one. It relies only on a security nonce.
*   The `delete_layout` and `save_layout` functions also lack proper user capability checks and post type verification, relying only on the same security nonce for authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Due to the lack of sanitization, a low-privileged user (contributor or higher) can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into page content using the `[fusion_code]` attribute. This code will execute whenever another user accesses the affected page.
*  **Arbitrary Post Deletion:** Due to insufficient authorization checks, a logged-in contributor can delete any post or page on the website.
*   **Arbitrary Post Creation:** Similar to deletion, a logged-in contributor can create posts with arbitrary parameters, including post type, status, and slug, and also inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser, leading to various impacts, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Data theft
    *   Other malicious actions.
*   **Arbitrary Post Deletion:** Attackers can delete any post or page on the website, causing data loss and service disruption.
*   **Arbitrary Post Creation:** Attackers can create posts that can be used for phishing or malware distribution, manipulate content, and perform other unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the WordPress AJAX API, specifically by sending requests to the `fusion_builder_update_layout`, `fusion_builder_delete_layout`, and `fusion_builder_save_layout` actions.
*   The attacker needs to be a logged-in WordPress user with Contributor role or higher.
*   They must obtain a valid `fusion_load_nonce` value, which is available in the HTML source of pages when a user accesses the post-new.php page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Attacker must have a WordPress account with at least Contributor privileges.
*   Attacker must be able to craft and send AJAX requests.
*  Attacker must have knowledge of the nonce in order to craft a malicious request.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable functions are located in "fusion-builder/inc/class-fusion-builder-library.php".
*   The nonce is generated in "fusion-builder/inc/class-fusion-builder.php".
*   The vulnerability affects Avada theme versions 6.2.2 and below.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 6.2.3.
*   The `[fusion_code]` attribute is enabled by default and allows for JavaScript injection.
