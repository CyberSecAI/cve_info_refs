```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "When the key is small relative to the digest (1024-bit key, 64-byte hash, 61-byte salt length), the internal message to hash is larger than the output size.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The internal message buffer used in RSA-PSS padding could overflow when the key size is small relative to the digest and salt length.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A buffer overflow could potentially lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution. The provided information doesn't explicitly specify the likelihood of arbitrary code execution but indicates the potential for a crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability occurs in the RSA-PSS padding function within the wolfSSL library. An attacker would need to supply inputs that cause the message to hash to be larger than the output size.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to influence the inputs to the RSA-PSS padding function, such as the key size, digest, and salt length. This could occur if the attacker can control the parameters for an RSA operation using the vulnerable library."
