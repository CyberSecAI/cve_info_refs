Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-36321

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper URL validation in the development mode handler of Vaadin Flow. The vulnerability stems from a lack of sufficient checks on URL paths, allowing for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The application does not properly validate user-supplied input, specifically URL paths.
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application allows access to files and directories outside of the intended web server's document root.
- **Double Encoding:** The vulnerability can be triggered via double encoding of the URL path.
- Inadequate check for directory change sequences such as `/../`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could gain access to arbitrary files on the server. This could expose sensitive information such as source code, configuration files, and other data.
- In development mode, developers could unintentionally expose their local file system if they visit a malicious website or allow external access to their development server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious URL with path traversal sequences or double-encoded directory traversal sequences, an attacker can bypass the intended resource access restrictions.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely if a developer's local development server is exposed to the internet or if a developer visits a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Vaadin application.
- The application has to be running in development mode, where the webpack development server is active.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the file system structure of the machine running the vulnerable Vaadin application to exploit path traversal.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Vaadin applications running in development mode and using the webpack development server.
- Production mode is not affected because the vulnerability relies on the webpack dev server, which is not used in production.
- The fix involves checking for double encoding and directory changes in the URL path and returning 403 Forbidden status code in case an invalid path is detected.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `com.vaadin:flow-server` versions 2.4.2 and later.
