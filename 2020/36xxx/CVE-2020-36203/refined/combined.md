### Description

`ARefss<'a, V>` is a type that is assumed to contain objects that are `Send + Sync`.

In the affected versions of this crate,
`Send`/`Sync` traits are unconditionally implemented for `ARefss<'a, V>`.

By using the `ARefss::map()` API, we can insert a `!Send` or `!Sync` object into `ARefss<'a, V>`. After that, it is possible to create a data race to the inner object of `ARefss<'a, V>`, which can lead to undefined behavior & memory corruption.

The flaw was corrected in commit 6dd7ca0 (https://github.com/diwic/reffers-rs/commit/6dd7ca0d50f2464df708975cdafcfaeeb6d41c66) by adding trait bound `V: Send + Sync` to `ARefss::map()` API.

## Description

![@JOE1994](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10286488?u=b10074df08a0e21e9483938c26612ad8e9dfec4b&v=4&size=48)[JOE1994](https://github.com/JOE1994)opened [on Dec 1, 2020](https://github.com/diwic/reffers-rs/issues/7#issue-754456748)

Hello ðŸ¦€ ,

while scanning crates.io, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) have noticed a soundness/memory safety issue in this crate which allows safe Rust code to trigger undefined behavior.

## Issue

It is possible to make `ARefss` contain a non-`Send` / non-`Sync` object,

since there is no `Send + Sync` bound on `V` in the `ARefss::map()` function.

```
pub fn map<V: ?Sized, F: FnOnce(&U) -> &V>(self, f: F) -> ARefss<'a, V>
```
## Proof of Concept

I wrote a short program that can trigger undefined behavior in safe Rust using this crate.

#### Test environment

* OS: Windows
* crate version : `reffers-0.6.0`
* compiled with `rustc 1.47.0 (18bf6b4f0 2020-10-07)`
* program exhibits a segmentation fault when compiled and run in `release` mode.

#### Error message from the program

```
error: process didn't exit successfully: `target\release\examples\reffers.exe` (exit code: 0xc0000005, STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION)
Segmentation fault
```

```
use std::cell::Cell;
use std::sync::Arc;

use reffers::aref::ARefss;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum RefOrInt<'a> {
    Ref(&'a u64),
    Int(u64),
}

static X: u64 = 0;
fn main() {
    let arc_0 = Arc::new(ARefss::new(Arc::new(0)).map(|_| {
        // New item is totally unrelated to the previously stored item.
        // New item is allowed to be !Sync, !Send.
        Box::leak(Box::new(Cell::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&X))))
        // Box::leak(Box::new(std::rc::Rc::new(0)))
    }));
    let arc_child = Arc::clone(&arc_0);

    std::thread::spawn(move || {
        let arc_child = arc_child;

        let smuggled_cell = arc_child.as_ref();
        loop {
            smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
            smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&X));
        }
    });

    loop {
        if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = arc_0.get() {
            if addr as *const _ as usize == 0xdeadbeef {
                // Due to the data race, obtaining Ref(0xdeadbeef) is possible
                println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
                println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Thank you for checking out this issue ðŸ¦€

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
