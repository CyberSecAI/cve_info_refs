- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The OMNIKEY 5427 and 5127 readers' webserver, when using the EEM driver, does not check the origin of configuration file upload requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The lack of origin validation on configuration file upload requests makes the device vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious website can upload a configuration file to the device. This file may contain commands that would be sent to the connected workstation. This could lead to arbitrary command execution on the workstation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker hosts a malicious website. When a user with a vulnerable OMNIKEY device visits this website, the website can send a forged request to the device's web server to upload a malicious configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host a website and have a victim user with a vulnerable OMNIKEY reader visit the website. The user must also have the EEM driver enabled and the device connected.
