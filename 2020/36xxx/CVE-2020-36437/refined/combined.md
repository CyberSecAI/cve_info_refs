# QueueSender/QueueReceiver: Send/Sync impls need `T: Send`
Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send`/`Sync` for `QueueSender`,
allowing to send non-Send `T` to other threads by invoking `(&QueueSender).send()`.
This fails to prevent users from creating data races by sending types like `Rc` or `Arc>` to other threads, which can lead to memory corruption.
The flaw was corrected in commit 1e462c3 by imposing `T: Send` to both `Send`/`Sync` impls for `QueueSender`/`QueueReceiver`.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@setuid0x0](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5169030?v=4&size=48)[setuid0x0](https://github.com/setuid0x0)opened [on Nov 24, 2020](https://github.com/longshorej/conqueue/issues/9#issue-749988512)

Hi there, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are scanning crates on crates.io for potential soundness bugs.

We noticed that the `QueueSender` object implements the Send and Sync traits for all types:

[conqueue/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/longshorej/conqueue/blob/61f02f82370eadf4bfbf9c42c7de059d622799ea/src/lib.rs#L79-L81)

Lines 79 to 81
in
[61f02f8](/longshorej/conqueue/commit/61f02f82370eadf4bfbf9c42c7de059d622799ea)

|  | unsafe impl<T> Sync for QueueSender<T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | unsafe impl<T> Send for QueueSender<T> {} |

However, this should probably be bounded by T: Sync and T: Send.

Otherwise, it's possible to smuggle non-Send types across thread boundaries or share non-Sync types across thread boundaries.

Here's an example of a data race in safe Rust code through a `conqueue::Queue`.

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use std::ops::Deref;
use std::rc::Rc;

const NUM_CLONES: usize = 1000000;

use conqueue::*;
use crossbeam_utils::thread;

fn main() {
    let (tx, mut rx) = conqueue::Queue::unbounded();

    let rc = Rc::new(true);
    tx.push(Box::new(rc.clone()));

    // We demonstrate the issue by racing the non-atomic reference counter type `Rc` between two threads.
    thread::scope(|s| {
        let child = s.spawn(|_| {
            // &Rc<bool> sent to another thread
            let smuggled = rx.pop();
            for _ in 0..NUM_CLONES {
                std::mem::forget(smuggled.clone());
            }
        });

        // if `child.join().unwrap()` is here, the program succeeds

        for _ in 0..NUM_CLONES {
            std::mem::forget(rc.clone());
        }

        child.join().unwrap();

        // We made NUM_CLONES on both threads plus initial 1 reference.
        // But in reality we'll see that the strong_count varies across every run due to data race.
        assert_eq!(Rc::strong_count(&rc), 2 * NUM_CLONES + 1);
    })
    .unwrap();
}
```

### Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send`/`Sync` for `QueueSender<T>`,
allowing to send non-Send `T` to other threads by invoking `(&QueueSender<T>).send()`.

This fails to prevent users from creating data races by sending types like `Rc<T>` or `Arc<Cell<T>>` to other threads, which can lead to memory corruption.

The flaw was corrected in commit 1e462c3 by imposing `T: Send` to both `Send`/`Sync` impls for `QueueSender<T>`/`QueueReceiver<T>`.
