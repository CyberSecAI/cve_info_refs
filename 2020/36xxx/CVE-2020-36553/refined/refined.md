Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36553:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization/validation in the `menu-add.php` page of the Multi Restaurant Table Reservation System. Specifically, the application does not sanitize the value of the `food_type` dropdown field before storing and displaying it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS. This occurs because the application allows users to inject malicious JavaScript code through the `food_type` dropdown which is then stored in the database and executed whenever the menu list is viewed (specifically in `/dashboard/menu-list.php`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who view the `/dashboard/menu-list.php` page. This can lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data from the application and the user's browser.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the web page.
    *   **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms or other deceptive content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attacker injects malicious code through the web interface of the application, specifically when adding or editing a menu item via `menu-add.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account and be logged into the system to access the `/dashboard/menu-add.php` and make changes to the menu items. The attacker must have the privileges to add or modify menu items.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters**: The attacker must know that the `food_type` dropdown is vulnerable to XSS.

**Technical Details (from the provided content):**

*   The vulnerability occurs at `/dashboard/menu-list.php`.
*   The malicious payload is inserted by modifying the value of the `food_type` dropdown when adding or editing a menu item at `/dashboard/menu-add.php`.
*   The provided exploit code shows the `food_type` field set to `<svg onload=prompt("XSS4")>`. This payload injects JavaScript to display a prompt box on the page where the menu list is displayed.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a classic example of a persistent XSS vulnerability due to improper input validation. An attacker with access to the menu management section can inject malicious scripts that will be executed on other users' browsers when they view the menu list page. This could lead to various attacks including data theft and session hijacking.
