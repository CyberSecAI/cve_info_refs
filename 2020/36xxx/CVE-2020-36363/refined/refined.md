The provided content discusses the TLSv1.2\_2019 security policy update for Amazon CloudFront, and a user's question about disabling specific ciphers. Although the content does not explicitly mention CVE-2020-36363, it provides details about the available cipher suites, and how they are managed by AWS.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability (Implied):**
While not explicitly a vulnerability, the discussion highlights the problem of not being able to control specific ciphers when using CloudFront. The user is concerned about weak ciphers included in the TLSv1.2\_2018 policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of granular control over cipher selection in CloudFront, forcing users to rely on predefined security policies. The TLSv1.2_2018 policy includes ciphers deemed "weak" by the user's security tool (e.g., `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384`)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Theoretically, if the weak ciphers are exploited, they could potentially allow an attacker to decrypt communications between CloudFront and viewers. However, this is not specifically discussed in the content. The main issue discussed is the lack of user control over the ciphers used by CloudFront and the presence of weak ciphers which can be a risk.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector would be a man-in-the-middle attack attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in the weaker ciphers to decrypt communications. However, the document does not explicitly discuss this attack vector, focusing on the policy changes made.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to be positioned to intercept network traffic between a viewer and CloudFront, and have the ability to exploit a vulnerability in the negotiated cipher. This would typically require network access on the path, and the technical skills to exploit the weak cipher.

**Additional Notes**
*   The content also introduces the `TLSv1.2_2019` security policy, which restricts ciphers to more secure algorithms such as GCM and ChaCha20.  This update addresses the user's concerns about weak ciphers, but it was not available at the time the question was asked.
*   The `TLSv1.2_2020` policy, which excludes the weak ciphers, was also discussed but was not yet made available for customers, highlighting that AWS manages the cipher suites and customers have to wait for new policies to be released.
