# Amazon CloudFront announces new TLS1.2 security policy for viewer connections

Posted On:  Jul 17, 2020

**Details**: Amazon CloudFront now supports a new security policy, TLSv1.2\_2019, which includes only the following ciphers:

* TLS\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256

* TLS\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384

* TLS\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305\_SHA256

* ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256

* ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256

* ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384

* ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305

* ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384

A security policy determines the SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront uses to communicate with viewers, and the cipher that CloudFront uses to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers. The TLSv1.2\_2019 policy sets the minimum negotiated Transport Layer Security (TLS) version to 1.2 and supports only the ciphers listed above. When you create a new distribution using a custom SSL certificate, TLSv1.2\_2019 will be the default policy option selected. You may use the AWS Management Console, Amazon CloudFront APIs, or AWS CloudFormation to update your existing distribution configuration to use this new security policy.

The TLSv1.2\_2019 security policy is available today. To learn more about this new policy and ciphers supported refer to [CloudFront's documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers). To get started with CloudFront, visit the [CloudFront product page](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/getting-started/).

I'm using a tool to do security checks and this tool marked the following ciphers as weak:

```
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 (0x003C)
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 (0xC027)
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 (0xC028)

```

I'm using the latest CloudFront Security Policy which is TLSv1.2\_2018 and the Minimum Origin SSL Protocol set to TLSv1.2.

But even with these settings the weak ciphers is still allowed.

Is it possible to disable some specific ciphers on CloudFront?

AWS doesn't allow customers to choose individual ciphers for Amazon CloudFront. Instead it allows customers to choose between different security policies. The available security policies are listed [in their documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers). As of now `TLSv1.2_2018` is the latest security policy they offer and also the one they recommend customers to use. This policy includes the three ciphers you'd like to disable, so there is currently no way to use TLS with AWS CloudFront without these ciphers.

Aside from the security policies offered to customers right now, AWS has already defined newer security policies for use with Amazon CloudFront in [`s2n`](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/introducing-s2n-a-new-open-source-tls-implementation/), the TLS-implementation they use for most of their public facing products.

Looking into [the source code of `s2n`](https://github.com/awslabs/s2n) reveals the following additional security policies and the ciphers they support:

[`TLSv1.2_2019`](https://github.com/awslabs/s2n/blob/ca288e0b98dfcbbe0aec977a7c85b5f841bcbe91/tls/s2n_cipher_preferences.c#L791-L796):

```
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256

```

[`TLSv1.2_2020`](https://github.com/awslabs/s2n/blob/ca288e0b98dfcbbe0aec977a7c85b5f841bcbe91/tls/s2n_cipher_preferences.c#L803-L807):

```
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256

```

The latest security policy (`TLSv1.2_2020`) doesn't include the three ciphers you want to disable anymore, so whenever AWS decides to make this security policy available to its customers, you'll be able to disable the ciphers in question.
