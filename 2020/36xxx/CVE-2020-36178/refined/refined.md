Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-36178:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure use of the `system()` function in the `util_execSystem` function, which is used extensively throughout the firmware. This function takes user-controlled input, formats it using `vsnprintf`, and then passes the resulting string directly to `system()` without any sanitization. This allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the operating system by manipulating input parameters that are later passed to `system()`.
- **Insecure use of `system()`:** The reliance on `system()` without proper input sanitization makes the system vulnerable to command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Full system compromise:** Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the router. This could result in:
   - Complete control of the device.
   - Ability to modify router settings.
   - Installation of malware.
   - Network redirection and eavesdropping.
   - Denial of service.
- **Data breaches:** Access to sensitive data, like the router's configuration and credentials, stored in memory or filesystem.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web administration interface:** The analysis indicates that the most likely attack vector is through the web administration interface. User-provided inputs such as network interface names could be injected into system commands.
- **Unspecified parameters:** The `util_execSystem` function is used in numerous places, meaning that there may be many injection points throughout the firmware, which were not fully explored.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to the web interface:** The attacker needs to have access to the router's web administration interface. This could be through a local network connection or remotely if remote management is enabled.
- **Knowledge of injectable parameters:** The attacker needs to identify which input parameters are used in system commands and can be injected.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided text details a full firmware analysis of a TP-Link TL-WR840N router, including how to extract the firmware, decrypt configuration files, and analyze the code using Ghidra.
- It identifies the use of DES encryption for configuration files and the storage of passwords in the `/etc/passwd` file.
- The analysis reveals that the default credentials are "admin:admin" and "admin:1234" which are then hashed, although this is not the main vulnerability
- It identifies the dropbear SSH service's use of the `dropbearpwd` file, which is initialized based on the decrypted configuration.
- The blog post also makes reference to [Pierre Kimâ€™s blog](https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2017-02-09-tplink-c2-and-c20i-vulnerable.html) and similar vulnerabilities.
- The analysis specifically mentions `oal_ipt_addBridgeIsolationRules` as an example of a command injection vulnerability.
- The post mentions that the author contacted TP-Link and created [CVE-2020-36178](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-36178) relating to the code injection issue.
