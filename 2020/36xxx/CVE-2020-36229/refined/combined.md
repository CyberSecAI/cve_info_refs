                 CVE-2020-36229 CVE-2020-36230

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenLDAP, a free
implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. An
unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of these flaws to
cause a denial of service (slapd daemon crash, infinite loops) via
specially crafted packets.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.47+dfsg-3+deb10u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your openldap packages.

For the detailed security status of openldap please refer to its
security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openldap>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

                 CVE-2020-36230

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenLDAP, a free
implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. An
unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of these flaws to
cause a denial of service (slapd daemon crash, infinite loops) via
specially crafted packets.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.4.44+dfsg-5+deb9u7.

We recommend that you upgrade your openldap packages.

For the detailed security status of openldap please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openldap>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
