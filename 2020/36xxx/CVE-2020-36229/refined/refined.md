Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-36229:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies within the `ldap_X509dn2bv` function of OpenLDAP. This function is responsible for converting an X.509 Distinguished Name (DN) to a BerVal (a structure used to represent data in OpenLDAP).
*   The core issue is a lack of sufficient checks when processing the input DN string, leading to a crash. Specifically, a crafted sequence of bytes is passed to a function that expects a leading character which is not present. This is a type confusion issue.
*   The crash occurs in the `ad_keystring` function at `ad.c:86` when it tries to access the first byte of the provided `bv_val` which is not a valid AD_LEADCHAR.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The `ldap_X509dn2bv` function does not properly validate the structure of the X.509 DN before processing it.
*   **Type Confusion:** The crafted input leads to type confusion. The system interprets data as a specific type when it is not, causing errors when accessing the data structure.
*   **Null pointer dereference:** The crafted input leads to a situation where a pointer is dereferenced without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash of the `slapd` daemon, which is the core server process for OpenLDAP. This can result in an interruption of directory services until the server is restarted. An infinite loop can also occur in some cases.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** An attacker can send malicious LDAP packets over the network to trigger the vulnerability. This can be done remotely.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the LDAP server to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send packets to an OpenLDAP server.
*   **Crafted Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to craft the specific sequence of bytes that triggers the vulnerable code path.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have any valid credentials or access to a user to be able to exploit it.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was identified through fuzzing using AFLplusplus.
*   The fix involves adding more checks to the `ldap_X509dn2bv` function, so that if invalid input is detected, the function would not cause a crash.
*   Patches and updates were released by OpenLDAP, Debian, and Apple to address this vulnerability.

The provided information confirms that CVE-2020-36229 is related to a denial-of-service vulnerability in OpenLDAP caused by improper input validation in the `ldap_X509dn2bv` function, which can be triggered by sending specially crafted packets without requiring authentication.
