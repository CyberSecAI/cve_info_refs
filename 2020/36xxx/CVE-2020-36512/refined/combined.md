## Description

![@JOE1994](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10286488?u=b10074df08a0e21e9483938c26612ad8e9dfec4b&v=4&size=48)[JOE1994](https://github.com/JOE1994)opened [on Dec 31, 2020](https://github.com/carllerche/buffoon/issues/2#issue-777061394)

Hello ü¶Ä , we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) found a memory-safety/soundness issue in this crate while scanning Rust code on crates.io for potential vulnerabilities.

## Issue Description

[`InputStream::read_exact()`](https://docs.rs/buffoon/0.5.0/src/buffoon/input_stream.rs.html#98-121) method creates an uninitialized buffer and passes it to user-provided `Read` implementation. This is unsound, because it may allow safe Rust code to exhibit an undefined behavior (read from uninitialized memory).

[This part](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html#tymethod.read) from the `Read` trait documentation explains the issue:

> It is your responsibility to make sure that `buf` is initialized before calling `read`. Calling read with an uninitialized `buf` (of the kind one obtains via `MaybeUninit<T>`) is not safe, and can lead to undefined behavior.

Thank you for checking out this issue üëç

Affected versions of this crate passes an uninitialized buffer to a user-provided `Read` implementation.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
