The provided content details multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in CMS Made Simple version 2.2.14.

**Root Cause:** The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in various administrative features. Specifically, the application fails to HTML entity encode user-supplied input before displaying it back to the user in various administrative interfaces. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored XSS vulnerabilities in:
  - "Manage Shortcuts" feature.
  - "Categories" via "Settings - New Module" feature.
  - "Options" via "Settings - New Module" feature.
  - "Content Editing Settings" via "Settings - Global Settings" feature.
  - "Admin Search" via "Extensions" feature.
  - "Maintenance Mode" via "Settings - Global Settings" feature.
  - "News" via "Content" feature (specifically in "Extra" field, not the slug).
- Reflected XSS vulnerabilities in:
  - "Design Manager" via "Layout" feature when creating a new Stylesheet.
  - "Design Manager" via "Layout" feature when creating a new Design.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
- Transmit private data, such as cookies or session information, to the attacker.
- Redirect victims to web content controlled by the attacker.
- Perform other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the administrative interface of the CMS, requiring an authenticated user.
- Malicious payloads are injected into various input fields.
- These payloads are then executed when the administrator views the affected pages or features.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with administrative privileges on the CMS Made Simple platform.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the administrative interface of the CMS.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious payloads in the various input fields.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability report indicates that some of the identified XSS issues have been fixed in subsequent versions of the software (2.2.15), particularly the Stored XSS issues. However, the reflected XSS issues in the Design Manager remain unfixed, with the explanation that they only affect the user who submits the malicious input.
- The report provides specific steps to reproduce each vulnerability, including the affected URLs and input fields.
- The report also provides example payloads that can be used to trigger the XSS vulnerabilities.
