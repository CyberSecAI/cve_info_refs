CVE-2020-36157
```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of filtering on the `role` parameter during the registration process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin does not properly validate the `role` parameter during registration allowing for arbitrary roles or capabilities to be assigned to a new user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can escalate their privileges to those of an administrator, potentially taking over the entire site and further infecting it with malware.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted registration request with a malicious `role` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to submit a registration request to the vulnerable website. No prior authentication is required.

```
CVE-2020-36155
```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the user registration form lacking checks on submitted user data, specifically user meta keys.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin allows arbitrary user meta keys to be updated during registration, including the `wp_capabilities` meta key that defines user roles.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain administrative access upon registration. This allows them to take over the entire site.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted registration request that includes a parameter to modify the `wp_capabilities` user meta.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to submit a registration request to the vulnerable website. No prior authentication is required.

```
CVE-2020-36156
```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of capability checks on a profile update.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin's `profile_update` function uses `is_admin()` alone without capability checks, allowing any user with access to the `profile.php` page to set their own role.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can escalate their privileges to those of an administrator.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated user with access to the profile page can send a crafted request with the `um-role` parameter set to an arbitrary role.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the `profile.php` page.
