Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official DedeCMS v5.7 SP2 UTF8 web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to compromise browser to
web-application requests from the application-side.
The persistent script code inject web vulnerabilities are located in the `activepath`, `keyword`, `tag`, `fmdo=x&filename`, `CKEditor`
and `CKEditorFuncNum`parameters of the `file\_pic\_view.php`, `file\_manage\_view.php`, `tags\_main.php`, `select\_media.php`, `media\_main.php` files.
The attack vector of the vulnerability is non-persistent and the request method to inject is POST. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability
results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation
of affected or connected application modules.
Request Method(s):
[+] POST
Vulnerable File(s):
[+] file\_pic\_view.php
[+] file\_manage\_view.php
[+] tags\_main.php
[+] select\_media.php
[+] media\_main.php
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] tag
[+] keyword
[+] activepath
[+] fmdo=move&filename & fmdo=edit&filename
[+] CKEditor & CKEditor=body&CKEditorFuncNum
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged user account and with low user interaction.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1. Parse the content to disallow html / js and special chars on the affected input fields
2. Restrict the vulnerable paramter prevent injects via post method request
3. Secure the output location were the content is insecure sanitized delivered as output
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the application-side persistent cross site scripting web vulnerabilities in the different modules are estimated as medium.
