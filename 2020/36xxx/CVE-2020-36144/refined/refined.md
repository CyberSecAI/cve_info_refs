Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of the username parameter used in the LDAP search filter. The application uses a template string with user-provided data to construct the LDAP query, which leads to an LDAP injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- LDAP Injection (CWE-90)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the LDAP directory by crafting malicious queries.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- The attack vector is through the login form where the user provides an email and password.
- The vulnerability exists in the `/redash/authentication/ldap_auth.py` file, specifically in the `auth_ldap_user` function.
- The vulnerable line of code is where the `LDAP_SEARCH_TEMPLATE` is formatted using the user-provided `username` without sanitization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have LDAP authentication enabled on the Redash application.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft special queries escaping the LDAP search template.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to submit a login attempt using a crafted email address to trigger the vulnerable code.
- No specific privilege is required other than being able to access the application's login form.
