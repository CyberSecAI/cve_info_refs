Root cause of vulnerability:
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in multiple Confluence plugins, allowing JavaScript code injection through various macro parameters.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in:
  - PlantUML plugin: Database Information macro's "datasources" parameter.
  - Refined Toolkit for Confluence: UI-Image and UI-Button macros' "url" parameter.
  - Linking for Confluence: Link in New Window macro's "href" parameter.
  - Countdown Timer plugin: Countdown Timer macro's "countdowndate" parameter.
  - Server Status plugin: HTTP Status and SMTP Status macros' "displayText" parameter.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view a Confluence page containing the malicious macro. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code through vulnerable macro parameters when creating or editing Confluence pages. The XSS payload is then triggered when a user views a page containing the manipulated macro.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to create or edit Confluence pages and insert malicious macro parameters. They do not need any special privileges other than standard page editing access.
