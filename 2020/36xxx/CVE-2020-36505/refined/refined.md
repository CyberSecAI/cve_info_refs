Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36505:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the "Delete All Comments Easily" WordPress plugin. The plugin does not implement proper nonce verification or similar mechanisms to validate that a request to delete all comments is indeed coming from an authorized user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a logged-in administrator without their consent or knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete all comments on the WordPress website. This results in data loss and potential disruption of site activity/functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted HTML form (or similar method) that submits a request to the plugin's comment deletion function.
- An attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious website or open a specially crafted link/email containing the malicious form.
- Once the administrator triggers the malicious form, the browser will send the request to the vulnerable plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious HTML form that triggers the comment deletion function of the vulnerable plugin.
- The attacker needs to induce a logged-in administrator to interact with this malicious form. This can be achieved through social engineering or similar methods. The attacker does not need any authentication or privileges on the target WordPress site.
- The attacker doesn't need to have direct access to the vulnerable system itself.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable plugin is "Delete All Comments Easily" with versions <= 1.3 affected.
- The exploit is considered relatively easy to perform as it simply requires a crafted HTML form and some social engineering to get an administrator to visit the attacker's page.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and OWASP A2 (Broken Authentication and Session Management).
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.3 (Medium).
- The vulnerability was originally discovered by Hoan Hp.
- No fix is currently available for this vulnerability.
