- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple parameters across several PHP files within the DedeCMS application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the `activepath`, `keyword`, `tag`, `fmdo=x&filename`, `CKEditor` and `CKEditorFuncNum` parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent redirects to malicious sources, and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.
- **Attack vectors**:  The vulnerabilities are triggered through HTTP POST requests to specific PHP files: `file_pic_view.php`, `file_manage_view.php`, `tags_main.php`, `select_media.php`, and `media_main.php`. The vulnerable parameters are `tag`, `keyword`, `activepath`, `fmdo=move&filename & fmdo=edit&filename`, `CKEditor`, and `CKEditor=body&CKEditorFuncNum`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a privileged user account (authenticated) on the DedeCMS application and can execute the attack remotely with low user interaction.
