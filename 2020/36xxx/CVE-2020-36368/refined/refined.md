The provided content is related to CVE-2020-36368.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by excessive recursion in the parsing logic of the `mjs` library. Specifically, the `parse_block`, `parse_statement`, and `parse_statement_list` functions call each other recursively, leading to stack exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unbounded recursion in parsing logic.
- Lack of proper checks to limit the depth of recursion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Stack overflow, leading to program crash or denial of service (DoS).
- Potential for more severe consequences if exploited maliciously (though not detailed here).

**Attack Vectors:**
- By providing specially crafted input to the parser, an attacker can trigger the recursive calls, causing the stack to overflow. The POC provided is a zip file that likely contains a malicious script that demonstrates the issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply input to the vulnerable parser.
- The attacker does not appear to require any privileged access.
