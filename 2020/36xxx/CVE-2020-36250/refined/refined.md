- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A faulty timestamp check in the ownCloud Android app allowed bypassing the app lock by setting the system date to the past.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the use of system time for checking app lock intervals, which can be easily manipulated by changing the system date.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical access to the device can bypass the app lock and gain unauthorized access to the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is physical access to the device running the vulnerable ownCloud Android application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have physical access to the device and the ability to change the system date.
