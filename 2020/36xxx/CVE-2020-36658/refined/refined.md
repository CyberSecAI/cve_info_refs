Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36658:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that, by default, the `Apache::Session::LDAP` module did not validate X.509 certificates when connecting to remote LDAP backends. It relied on the default behavior of the `Net::LDAPS` Perl module, which does not enforce certificate verification by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The primary weakness is the lack of certificate validation by default. This allowed connections to potentially malicious LDAP servers without any verification of their identity.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Vulnerability:**  Without certificate validation, an attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack by intercepting communication between the application and the LDAP server and impersonating the LDAP server, potentially stealing user sessions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could intercept and steal session data if they are able to perform MitM attacks, if session data is stored in LDAP.
*   **Data Breaches:** If the application is storing sensitive user information in LDAP, an attacker could potentially access this data by impersonating the LDAP server.
*   **Compromise of Application Logic**: By injecting arbitrary data, the attacker may be able to alter the application's logic or bypass authorization checks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker positioned between the application and the LDAP server can intercept network traffic.
*   **Malicious LDAP Server:** An attacker may set up a rogue LDAP server that the application connects to because the application will not validate the server's certificate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or reroute network traffic between the application and the LDAP server for MitM attacks. Alternatively, the attacker needs to control a malicious LDAP server accessible by the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
*   The fix involves changing the default behavior to require X.509 validation using the distribution's CA certificate bundle (`/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`).
*   The previous insecure behavior can be restored by setting `ldapVerify => "none"` when initializing the `Apache::Session::LDAP` object.
*   The advisory notes that this update is a prerequisite for fixing CVE-2020-16093 in LemonLDAP::NG when its session backend is `Apache::Session::LDAP`.
* The commit diff shows the addition of the `ldapVerify` and `ldapCAFile` parameters and use of `verify` parameter during the LDAP connection.
