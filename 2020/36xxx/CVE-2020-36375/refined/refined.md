The provided content is related to CVE-2020-36375.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack overflow due to excessive recursion in the parser of the mjs (embedded JavaScript engine) library. Specifically, the parsing functions such as `parse_unary`, `parse_mul_div_rem`, `parse_plus_minus`, etc. call each other recursively without proper checks, leading to a stack overflow when processing a crafted input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unbounded recursion in the expression parser.
- Lack of checks to prevent excessive recursion.
- Stack overflow vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application due to stack overflow.
- Potentially, arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the stack content, but the provided report focuses on DoS.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted JavaScript code that leads to deep recursion in the parser.
- The provided POC.zip contains the malicious input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input (a malicious JavaScript code) to the affected mjs engine.
- No specific privileges are needed.
