Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-36065

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the `/system/admin/admin_save` endpoint of the FlyCms application. Specifically, there is no check for a valid CSRF token or the HTTP Referer header when processing the administrator creation request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application fails to implement CSRF protection mechanisms, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests that can be executed by a logged-in administrator without their consent.
- **Lack of Referer Check:** The application does not validate the `Referer` header to ensure the request is originating from the application's domain, further exacerbating the CSRF risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Account Creation:** A successful CSRF attack enables an attacker to create a new administrator account with full privileges.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Once an attacker gains access through the created administrator account, they can fully control the application and its associated data, leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Webpage:** An attacker can host a malicious webpage that contains a form that sends a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/system/admin/admin_save`)
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious webpage in order to execute the attack

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage accessible to the victim user.
- **Target User Logged In:** The victim needs to be an authenticated administrator user of the FlyCms application and needs to be logged into the application while visiting the malicious webpage.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and the required POST request parameters for administrator creation.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) HTML code demonstrates how a malicious form can be constructed to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.
- The vulnerable code snippet shows that the `addAdminSave` method does not perform any CSRF token validation or referer checks
- The provided screenshot confirms that a new admin account has been created successfully using the described CSRF attack.
