## Package

cargo

convec
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

<= 2.0.1

## Patched versions

None

## Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `ConVec<T>`.

This allows users to insert `T` that is not Send or not Sync.

This allows users to create data races by using non-Send types like `Arc<Cell<_>>` or `Rc<_>` as `T` in `ConVec<T>`. It is also possible to create data races by using types like `Cell<_>` or `RefCell<_>` as `T` (types that are `Send` but not `Sync`).

Such data races can lead to memory corruption.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# convec::ConVec lacks a bound on its Send trait and Sync trait #2

## Description

![@setuid0x0](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5169030?v=4&size=48)[setuid0x0](https://github.com/setuid0x0)opened [on Nov 24, 2020](https://github.com/krl/convec/issues/2#issue-749950390)

Hi there, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are scanning crates on crates.io for potential soundness bugs.

We noticed that the `convec::ConVec` object implements the Send and Sync traits for all types:

[convec/src/convec.rs](https://github.com/krl/convec/blob/1591dcdda05fdbc5483333411c0c7ac7e16f61c7/src/convec.rs#L16-L17)

Lines 16 to 17
in
[1591dcd](/krl/convec/commit/1591dcdda05fdbc5483333411c0c7ac7e16f61c7)

|  | unsafe impl<T> Sync for ConVec<T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<T> Send for ConVec<T> {} |

This allows objects like `Cell` that doesn't implement `Sync` to be shared across threads leading to undefined behavior.

The code below crashes due to the data race.

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use std::cell::Cell;

use convec::*;
use crossbeam_utils::thread;

static SOME_INT: u128 = 0x41414141;

fn main() {
    // A simple tagged union used to demonstrate the problems with data races
    // in Cell. Cell is designed for single threads and has no synchronization
    // methods. Thus if it is allowed to be used simultaneously by two threads,
    // it is possible to race its interior mutability methods to dereference an
    // arbitrary pointer.
    #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
    enum RefOrInt<'a> {
        Ref(&'a u128),
        Int(u128),
    }

    let mut vec: AoVec<Cell<RefOrInt>> = AoVec::new();
    vec.push(Cell::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT)));

    thread::scope(|s| {
        let vec_ref = &vec;
        let child = s.spawn(move |_| {
            let smuggled = vec_ref.get(0).unwrap();

            println!("Child thread: {:p} - {:?}", smuggled.as_ptr(), smuggled);
            loop {
                // Repeatedly write Ref(&addr) and Int(0xdeadbeef) into the cell.
                smuggled.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
                smuggled.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
            }
        });

        let main_cell = vec_ref.get(0).unwrap();
        println!("Main thread: {:p} - {:?}", main_cell.as_ptr(), main_cell);
        loop {
            if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = main_cell.clone().into_inner() {
                // Hope that between the time we pattern match the object as a
                // `Ref`, it gets written to by the child thread.
                if addr as *const u128 == &SOME_INT as *const u128 {
                    continue;
                }

                // Due to the data race, obtaining Ref(0xdeadbeef) is possible
                println!("Reference points to: {:p}", addr);
                println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
            }
        }
    });
}
