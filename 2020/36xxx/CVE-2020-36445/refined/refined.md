Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `convec` crate's `ConVec<T>` type unconditionally implements the `Send` and `Sync` traits, regardless of the type `T`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unconditional `Send` and `Sync` Implementation:** The crate incorrectly assumes that any type `T` used with `ConVec<T>` is safe to send across threads and access concurrently. This violates the core principles of Rust's safety model.
- **Data Races:** By implementing `Send` and `Sync` without proper bounds on `T`, the crate allows users to insert types that are not actually thread-safe, such as `Cell<_>`, `RefCell<_>`, `Arc<Cell<_>>` and `Rc<_>`. This enables data races when multiple threads access the same `ConVec<T>` instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Data races resulting from the incorrect `Send`/`Sync` implementation can lead to memory corruption.
- **Undefined Behavior:** Data races can cause unpredictable program behavior, crashes, and potentially security vulnerabilities.
- **Loss of Data Integrity and Availability:** Memory corruption can lead to data being modified unexpectedly and ultimately could make the program unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The CVSS score indicates the attack vector is network-based, but this needs further context. The core vulnerability lies in incorrect handling of concurrency within the crate and how itâ€™s used. The network attack vector might be indirect if the vulnerable library is exposed in a multithreaded network service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to use the `convec` crate:** An attacker would need to incorporate the vulnerable `convec` library in their application.
- **Multithreaded Environment:** The vulnerability requires a multi-threaded context to trigger the data races.
- **Usage of non-Send/Sync Types:** The attacker would need to insert types that are not `Send` or `Sync` (or both) into a `ConVec<T>` to trigger the issue.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions `<= 2.0.1` of the `convec` crate.
- There are no patched versions of the crate.
- The vulnerability is classified as high severity and the CVSS score is 8.1
- The vulnerability is tracked by RUSTSEC-2020-0125, CVE-2020-36445, and GHSA-rpxm-vmr7-5f5f
- The provided code example shows how to exploit this vulnerability by inserting `Cell<RefOrInt>` into the `ConVec` and triggering a data race between threads.
- The issue was reported on November 24, 2020, and published on January 30, 2021.
