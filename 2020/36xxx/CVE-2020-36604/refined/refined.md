The provided content is related to CVE-2020-36604.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `clone()` function in the `hoek` library incorrectly handles objects with a `__proto__` key. When such an object is passed to `clone()`, the `__proto__` key is treated as a prototype, leading to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype pollution vulnerability. The `clone()` function does not properly sanitize input and allows modification of the prototype of objects.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The vulnerability can lead to unexpected behavior or potential security issues if untrusted data is processed by the `clone()` function.
- The impact is considered low because hapi, the main consumer of the `hoek` library, ensures no such invalid object can pass into the application from user input.

**Attack vectors:**
- Passing an object with a `__proto__` key to the `clone()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `clone()` function and pass an object containing the `__proto__` key.
- The attacker must also have the capability to inject such data into a system internal to be processed by the vulnerable `clone()` function.
