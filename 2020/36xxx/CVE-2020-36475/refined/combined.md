Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in mbedtls, a
lightweight crypto and SSL/TLS library, which may allow attackers to obtain
sensitive information like the RSA private key or cause a denial of service
(application or server crash).

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.16.9-0~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mbedtls packages.

For the detailed security status of mbedtls please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/mbedtls>

SUMMARY

Devices of the LOGO! CMR family and the SIMATIC RTU 3000 family are affected by several vulnerabilities
in the third party component Mbed TLS. They could allow an attacker with access to any of the interfaces
of an affected device to impact the availability or to communicate with invalid certiÔ¨Åcates.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiÔ¨Åed the following speciÔ¨Åc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

‚Ä¢ For CVE-2020-36478: Use the certiÔ¨Åcate projection feature to pin the valid certiÔ¨Åcates of external

servers providing services to the RTU/CMR devices. See the manual for further information

Product speciÔ¨Åc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conÔ¨Ågure the environment according to Siemens‚Äô operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The devices of the LOGO! CMR family (in combination with the LOGO! logic module) are cost-efÔ¨Åcient
communication systems suitable for monitoring and controlling distributed plants and systems via text
message or email. LOGO! CMR devices can send text messages or emails to predeÔ¨Åned mobile network
numbers as well as receive text messages from predeÔ¨Åned mobile network numbers. The LOGO! CMR
devices offer comfortable Web Based Management commissioning and diagnostics via local and/or
remote access.

The devices of the RTU3000C family are compact telecontrol stations for applications with their own
power supply for autonomous energy systems. They are particularly suited for monitoring and control
of external stations that are not connected to an energy supply network. The RTUs can autonomously
record data with time stamp from connected sensors, pre-process this data and transfer it to a control
center.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiÔ¨Åcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.Ô¨Årst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciÔ¨Åc to the customer‚Äôs
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deÔ¨Åned by the customer to accomplish Ô¨Ånal scoring.

An additional classiÔ¨Åcation has been performed using the CWE classiÔ¨Åcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiÔ¨Åcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-36475

The calculations performed in the third-party component Mbed TLS are not limited; thus, supplying
overly large parameters could lead to denial of service when generating DifÔ¨Åe-Hellman key pairs.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-36478

For the third-party component Mbed TLS a NULL algorithm parameters entry looks identical to an
array of REAL (size zero) and thus the certiÔ¨Åcate is considered valid. However, if the parameters do
not match in any way, then the certiÔ¨Åcate should be considered invalid.

## Description

This release of Mbed TLS provides bug fixes, minor enhancements and new features. This release includes fixes for security issues.

## API changes

* The numerical values of the PSA Crypto API macros have been updated to conform to version 1.0.0 of the specification.
* PSA\_ALG\_STREAM\_CIPHER replaces PSA\_ALG\_CHACHA20 and PSA\_ALG\_ARC4. The underlying stream cipher is determined by the key type (PSA\_KEY\_TYPE\_CHACHA20 or PSA\_KEY\_TYPE\_ARC4).
* The functions mbedtls\_cipher\_auth\_encrypt() and mbedtls\_cipher\_auth\_decrypt() no longer accept NIST\_KW contexts, as they have no way to check if the output buffer is large enough. Please use mbedtls\_cipher\_auth\_encrypt\_ext() and mbedtls\_cipher\_auth\_decrypt\_ext() instead. Credit to OSS-Fuzz and Cryptofuzz. Fixes [#3665](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3665).

## Requirement changes

* Update the minimum required CMake version to 2.8.12. This silences a warning on CMake 3.19.0. [#3801](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3801)

## New deprecations

* PSA\_KEY\_TYPE\_CHACHA20 and PSA\_KEY\_TYPE\_ARC4 have been deprecated. Use PSA\_ALG\_STREAM\_CIPHER instead.
* The functions mbedtls\_cipher\_auth\_encrypt() and mbedtls\_cipher\_auth\_decrypt() are deprecated in favour of the new functions mbedtls\_cipher\_auth\_encrypt\_ext() and mbedtls\_cipher\_auth\_decrypt\_ext(). Please note that with AEAD ciphers, these new functions always append the tag to the ciphertext, and include the tag in the ciphertext length.

## Features

* Partial implementation of the new PSA Crypto accelerator APIs. (Symmetric ciphers, asymmetric signing/verification and key generation, validate\_key entry point, and export\_public\_key interface.)
* Add support for ECB to the PSA cipher API.
* In PSA, allow using a key declared with a base key agreement algorithm in combined key agreement and derivation operations, as long as the key agreement algorithm in use matches the algorithm the key was declared with. This is currently non-standard behaviour, but expected to make it into a future revision of the PSA Crypto standard.
* Add MBEDTLS\_TARGET\_PREFIX CMake variable, which is prefixed to the mbedtls, mbedcrypto, mbedx509 and apidoc CMake target names. This can be used by external CMake projects that include this one to avoid CMake target name clashes. The default value of this variable is "", so default target names are unchanged.
* Add support for DTLS-SRTP as defined in RFC 5764. Contributed by Johan Pascal, improved by Ron Eldor.
* In the PSA API, it is no longer necessary to open persistent keys: operations now accept the key identifier. The type psa\_key\_handle\_t is now identical to psa\_key\_id\_t instead of being platform-defined. This bridges the last major gap to compliance with the PSA Cryptography specification version 1.0.0. Opening persistent keys is still supported for backward compatibility, but will be deprecated and later removed in future releases.
* PSA\_AEAD\_NONCE\_LENGTH, PSA\_AEAD\_NONCE\_MAX\_SIZE, PSA\_CIPHER\_IV\_LENGTH and PSA\_CIPHER\_IV\_MAX\_SIZE macros have been added as defined in version 1.0.0 of the PSA Crypto API specification.

## Security

* The functions mbedtls\_cipher\_auth\_encrypt() and mbedtls\_cipher\_auth\_decrypt() would write past the minimum documented size of the output buffer when used with NIST\_KW. As a result, code using those functions as documented with NIST\_KW could have a buffer overwrite of up to 15 bytes, with consequences ranging up to arbitrary code execution depending on the location of the output buffer.
* Limit the size of calculations performed by mbedtls\_mpi\_exp\_mod to MBEDTLS\_MPI\_MAX\_SIZE to prevent a potential denial of service when generating Diffie-Hellman key pairs. Credit to OSS-Fuzz.
* A failure of the random generator was ignored in mbedtls\_mpi\_fill\_random(), which is how most uses of randomization in asymmetric cryptography (including key generation, intermediate value randomization and blinding) are implemented. This could cause failures or the silent use of non-random values. A random generator can fail if it needs reseeding and cannot not obtain entropy, or due to an internal failure (which, for Mbed TLS's own CTR\_DRBG or HMAC\_DRBG, can only happen due to a misconfiguration).
* Fix a compliance issue whereby we were not checking the tag on the algorithm parameters (only the size) when comparing the signature in the description part of the cert to the real signature. This meant that a NULL algorithm parameters entry would look identical to an array of REAL (size zero) to the library and thus the certificate would be considered valid. However, if the parameters do not match in *any* way then the certificate should be considered invalid, and indeed OpenSSL marks these certs as invalid when mbedtls did not. Many thanks to guidovranken who found this issue via differential fuzzing and reported it in [#3629](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3629).
* Zeroising of local buffers and variables which are used for calculations in mbedtls\_pkcs5\_pbkdf2\_hmac(), mbedtls\_internal\_sha\*\_process(), mbedtls\_internal\_md\*\_process() and mbedtls\_internal\_ripemd160\_process() functions to erase sensitive data from memory. Reported by Johan Malmgren and Johan Uppman Bruce from Sectra.

## Bugfix

* Fix an invalid (but nonzero) return code from mbedtls\_pk\_parse\_subpubkey() when the input has trailing garbage. Fixes [#2512](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/2512).
* Fix build failure in configurations where MBEDTLS\_USE\_PSA\_CRYPTO is enabled but ECDSA is disabled. Contributed by jdurkop. Fixes [#3294](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3294).
* Include the psa\_constant\_names generated source code in the source tree instead of generating it at build time. Fixes [#3524](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3524).
* Fix rsa\_prepare\_blinding() to retry when the blinding value is not invertible (mod N), instead of returning MBEDTLS\_ERR\_RSA\_RNG\_FAILED. This addresses a regression but is rare in practice (approx. 1 in 2/sqrt(N)). Found by Synopsys Coverity, fix contributed by Peter Kolbus (Garmin). Fixes [#3647](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3647).
* Use socklen\_t on Android and other POSIX-compliant system
* Fix the build when the macro \_GNU\_SOURCE is defined to a non-empty value. Fix [#3432](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3432).
* Consistently return PSA\_ERROR\_INVALID\_ARGUMENT on invalid cipher input sizes (instead of PSA\_ERROR\_BAD\_STATE in some cases) to make the psa\_cipher\_\* functions compliant with the PSA Crypto API specification.
* mbedtls\_ecp\_curve\_list() now lists Curve25519 and Curve448 under the names "x25519" and "x448". These curves support ECDH but not ECDSA. If you need only the curves that support ECDSA, filter the list with mbedtls\_ecdsa\_can\_do().
* Fix psa\_generate\_key() returning an error when asked to generate an ECC key pair on Curve25519 or secp244k1.
* Fix psa\_key\_derivation\_output\_key() to allow the output of a combined key agreement and subsequent key derivation operation to be used as a key inside of the PSA Crypto core.
* Fix handling of EOF against 0xff bytes and on platforms with unsigned chars. Fixes a build failure on platforms where char is unsigned. Fixes [#3794](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3794).
* Fix an off-by-one error in the additional data length check for CCM, which allowed encryption with a non-standard length field. Fixes [#3719](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3719).
* Correct the default IV size for mbedtls\_cipher\_info\_t structures using MBEDTLS\_MODE\_ECB to 0, since ECB mode ciphers don't use IVs.
* Make arc4random\_buf available on NetBSD and OpenBSD when \_POSIX\_C\_SOURCE is defined. Fix contributed in [#3571](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/pull/3571).
* Fix conditions for including string.h in error.c. Fixes [#3866](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3866).
* psa\_set\_key\_id() now also sets the lifetime to persistent for keys located in a secure element.
* Attempting to create a volatile key with a non-zero key identifier now fails. Previously the key identifier was just ignored when creating a volatile key.
* Attempting to create or register a key with a key identifier in the vendor range now fails.
* Fix build failures on GCC 11. Fixes [#3782](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3782).
* Add missing arguments of debug message in mbedtls\_ssl\_decrypt\_buf.
* Fix a memory leak in mbedtls\_mpi\_sub\_abs() when the result was negative (an error condition) and the second operand was aliased to the result.
* Fix a case in elliptic curve arithmetic where an out-of-memory condition could go undetected, resulting in an incorrect result.
* In CTR\_DRBG and HMAC\_DRBG, don't reset the reseed interval in seed(). Fixes [#2927](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/2927).
* In PEM writing functions, fill the trailing part of the buffer with null bytes. This guarantees that the corresponding parsing function can read the buffer back, which was the case for mbedtls\_x509write\_{crt,csr}\_pem until this property was inadvertently broken in Mbed TLS 2.19.0. Fixes [#3682](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3682).
* Fix a build failure that occurred with the MBEDTLS\_AES\_SETKEY\_DEC\_ALT option on. In this configuration key management methods that are required for MBEDTLS\_CIPHER\_MODE\_XTS were excluded from the build and made it fail. Fixes [#3818](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3818). Reported by John Stroebel.

## Changes

* Reduce stack usage significantly during sliding window exponentiation. Reported in [#3591](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3591) and fix contributed in [#3592](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/pull/3592) by Daniel Otte.
* The PSA persistent storage format is updated to always store the key bits attribute. No automatic upgrade path is provided. Previously stored keys must be erased, or manually upgraded based on the key storage format specification (docs/architecture/mbed-crypto-storage-specification.md). Fixes [#3740](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3740).
* Remove the zeroization of a pointer variable in AES rounds. It was valid but spurious and misleading since it looked like a mistaken attempt to zeroize the pointed-to buffer. Reported by Antonio de la Piedra, CEA Leti, France.

## Description

This release of Mbed TLS provides bug fixes and minor enhancements. This release includes fixes for security issues.

## Security

* Limit the size of calculations performed by mbedtls\_mpi\_exp\_mod to MBEDTLS\_MPI\_MAX\_SIZE to prevent a potential denial of service when generating Diffie-Hellman key pairs. Credit to OSS-Fuzz.
* Fix a compliance issue whereby we were not checking the tag on the algorithm parameters (only the size) when comparing the signature in the description part of the cert to the real signature. This meant that a NULL algorithm parameters entry would look identical to an array of REAL (size zero) to the library and thus the certificate would be considered valid. However, if the parameters do not match in *any* way then the certificate should be considered invalid, and indeed OpenSSL marks these certs as invalid when mbedtls did not. Many thanks to guidovranken who found this issue via differential fuzzing and reported it in [#3629](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3629).
* Zeroising of local buffers and variables which are used for calculations in mbedtls\_pkcs5\_pbkdf2\_hmac(), mbedtls\_internal\_sha\*\_process(), mbedtls\_internal\_md\*\_process() and mbedtls\_internal\_ripemd160\_process() functions to erase sensitive data from memory. Reported by Johan Malmgren and Johan Uppman Bruce from Sectra.

## Bugfix

* Fix an invalid (but nonzero) return code from mbedtls\_pk\_parse\_subpubkey() when the input has trailing garbage. Fixes [#2512](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/2512).
* Fix rsa\_prepare\_blinding() to retry when the blinding value is not invertible (mod N), instead of returning MBEDTLS\_ERR\_RSA\_RNG\_FAILED. This addresses a regression but is rare in practice (approx. 1 in 2/sqrt(N)). Found by Synopsys Coverity, fix contributed by Peter Kolbus (Garmin). Fixes [#3647](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3647).
* Correct the default IV size for mbedtls\_cipher\_info\_t structures using MBEDTLS\_MODE\_ECB to 0, since ECB mode ciphers don't use IVs.
* Fix build failures on GCC 11. Fixes [#3782](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3782).

* Limit the size of calculations performed by mbedtls\_mpi\_exp\_mod to MBEDTLS\_MPI\_MAX\_SIZE to prevent a potential denial of service when generating Diffie-Hellman key pairs. Credit to OSS-Fuzz.
* A failure of the random generator was ignored in mbedtls\_mpi\_fill\_random(), which is how most uses of randomization in asymmetric cryptography (including key generation, intermediate value randomization and blinding) are implemented. This could cause failures or the silent use of non-random values. A random generator can fail if it needs reseeding and cannot not obtain entropy, or due to an internal failure (which, for Mbed TLS's own CTR\_DRBG or HMAC\_DRBG, can only happen due to a misconfiguration).
* Fix a compliance issue whereby we were not checking the tag on the algorithm parameters (only the size) when comparing the signature in the description part of the cert to the real signature. This meant that a NULL algorithm parameters entry would look identical to an array of REAL (size zero) to the library and thus the certificate would be considered valid. However, if the parameters do not match in *any* way then the certificate should be considered invalid, and indeed OpenSSL marks these certs as invalid when mbedtls did not. Many thanks to guidovranken who found this issue via differential fuzzing and reported it in [#3629](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3629).
* Zeroising of local buffers and variables which are used for calculations in mbedtls\_pkcs5\_pbkdf2\_hmac(), mbedtls\_internal\_sha\*\_process(), mbedtls\_internal\_md\*\_process() and mbedtls\_internal\_ripemd160\_process() functions to erase sensitive data from memory. Reported by Johan Malmgren and Johan Uppman Bruce from Sectra.

## Bugfix

* Fix an invalid (but nonzero) return code from mbedtls\_pk\_parse\_subpubkey() when the input has trailing garbage. Fixes [#2512](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/2512).
* Fix rsa\_prepare\_blinding() to retry when the blinding value is not invertible (mod N), instead of returning MBEDTLS\_ERR\_RSA\_RNG\_FAILED. This addresses a regression but is rare in practice (approx. 1 in 2/sqrt(N)). Found by Synopsys Coverity, fix contributed by Peter Kolbus (Garmin). Fixes [#3647](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3647).
* Fix the build when the macro \_GNU\_SOURCE is defined to a non-empty value. Fix [#3432](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3432).
* Correct the default IV size for mbedtls\_cipher\_info\_t structures using MBEDTLS\_MODE\_ECB to 0, since ECB mode ciphers don't use IVs.
* Make arc4random\_buf available on NetBSD and OpenBSD when \_POSIX\_C\_SOURCE is defined. Fix contributed in [#3571](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/pull/3571). Adopted for LTS branch 2.16 in [#3602](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/pull/3602).
* Fix build failures on GCC 11. Fixes [#3782](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3782).
* Fix a memory leak in mbedtls\_mpi\_sub\_abs() when the result was negative (an error condition) and the second operand was aliased to the result.
* Fix a case in elliptic curve arithmetic where an out-of-memory condition could go undetected, resulting in an incorrect result.
* In CTR\_DRBG and HMAC\_DRBG, don't reset the reseed interval in seed().

  Fixes [#2927](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/2927).
* In PEM writing functions, fill the trailing part of the buffer with null bytes. This guarantees that the corresponding parsing function can read the buffer back, which was the case for mbedtls\_x509write\_{crt,csr}\_pem until this property was inadvertently broken in Mbed TLS 2.19.0. Fixes [#3682](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3682).
* Fix a build failure that occurred with the MBEDTLS\_AES\_SETKEY\_DEC\_ALT option on. In this configuration key management methods that are required for MBEDTLS\_CIPHER\_MODE\_XTS were excluded from the build and made it fail. Fixes [#3818](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3818). Reported by John Stroebel.

## Changes

* Reduce stack usage significantly during sliding window exponentiation. Reported in [#3591](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/issues/3591) and fix contributed in [#3592](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/pull/3592) by Daniel Otte.
* Remove the zeroization of a pointer variable in AES rounds. It was valid but spurious and misleading since it looked like a mistaken attempt to zeroize the pointed-to buffer. Reported by Antonio de la Piedra, CEA Leti, France.
