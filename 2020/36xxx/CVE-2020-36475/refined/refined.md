Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36475:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of size limitation in calculations performed within the `mbedtls_mpi_exp_mod` function when generating Diffie-Hellman key pairs. Specifically, overly large parameters could be supplied, leading to excessive computation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size (CWE-131):** The core issue lies in the insufficient handling of input parameters during Diffie-Hellman key pair generation, which leads to an excessive calculation of buffer size, triggering the denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by providing very large parameters, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive due to excessive computational load.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access to a vulnerable device or application using mbedtls library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send data to a system that uses the vulnerable version of mbedtls and performs Diffie-Hellman key generation.
- No specific privilege is required, the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in mbedtls versions 2.7.18, 2.16.9 and 2.25.0 (and presumably later).
- Siemens products like LOGO! CMR family and SIMATIC RTU 3000 family were affected, and updates were released to address this.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5, with the vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:U/RL:O/RC:C
