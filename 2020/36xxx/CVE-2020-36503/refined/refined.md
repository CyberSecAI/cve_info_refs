Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-36503:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation and sanitization of certain input fields within the Connections Business Directory WordPress plugin when exporting data to a CSV file. The plugin's `getData()` function does not filter these fields

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CSV Injection (Formula Injection):** The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input before including it in a CSV file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code (e.g., spreadsheet formulas) into the CSV file, which can be executed when the CSV is opened with software like Microsoft Excel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** When a user opens the maliciously crafted CSV file, the injected formulas can execute commands on the user's machine. In the provided example, the payload `@SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0` opens the Windows calculator application when the CSV file is opened in Excel. This could be leveraged to perform more malicious actions such as data exfiltration, installing malware, or any other arbitrary command execution on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Plugin Input Fields:** An attacker can insert malicious code into any input field of the Connections plugin's add entry page (e.g., `admin.php?page=connections_add`).
- **Export Functionality:** The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator uses the "Export All" feature in the plugin's tools page, which generates a CSV file containing the injected code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Administrator Access:** The attacker needs to have administrator access to the WordPress website to add an entry and export the malicious CSV file.
- **User Interaction:** The user must open the downloaded CSV file in an application like Microsoft Excel for the malicious code to be executed.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Connections Business Directory plugin versions prior to 9.7.
- The provided proof of concept uses the payload `@SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0` to trigger the vulnerability, which opens the calculator application when the CSV file is opened with Microsoft Excel.
- The issue was reported on May 29, 2020, and a fix was implemented in version 9.7.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-1236 and is related to OWASP's A1: Injection category.
- The CVSS score is 4.0 (Medium).
