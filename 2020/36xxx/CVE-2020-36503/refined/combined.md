## Description

CSV Injection, also known as Formula Injection, occurs when websites embed untrusted input inside CSV files. Which lead to hijacking user’s computer by exploiting with untrusted input. In this plugin, all the input fields of [connections\_add](http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=connections_add) are affected.

## Affected Item

> Export All feature

## Affected Version

> 0.7.3.2 <= 9.6

## Tested With

> Wordpress 5.4.1

## Step to reproduce

1. Login to your website
2. Visit <http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=connections_add>
3. In the input filed add payload `@SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0`
4. Visit [Connections Tools](http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=connections_tools) and then click on `Export All`
5. It will download a file `cn-export-all-MM-DD-YYYY.csv` open it with `Microsoft Excel`
6. It will open `CMD`

All fields are not checked because `getData()` doesn't filter any of the fields.
