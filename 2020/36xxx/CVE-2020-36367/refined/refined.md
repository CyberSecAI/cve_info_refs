The content is related to CVE-2020-36367.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack exhaustion due to uncontrolled recursion in parsing functions. Specifically, the `parse_block`, `parse_statement`, and `parse_statement_list` functions call each other recursively without proper checks, leading to a stack overflow. The issue is triggered when processing a crafted input that leads to deeply nested blocks/statements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled recursion, leading to stack exhaustion. The recursive calls to the parsing functions lack proper safeguards, allowing for an arbitrarily deep call stack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service via stack overflow. The program will crash due to stack exhaustion making the application unusable.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted input to the mjs interpreter/parser. The specific format is not described in the issue, but it's assumed to be malicious javascript code that can be provided by attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply malicious javascript code to the vulnerable mjs interpreter. The attacker does not need any special privileges.
