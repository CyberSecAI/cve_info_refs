Firstly this article is based on my findings .Its not based on political view unlike fs0c131y xD . My research on UC browser is not complete yet . I will update my article . I downloaded the UC mini app on my old phone . As usual I turned on burp,set up a proxy and intercepted the requests . There were lots of interesting requests . But i checked for two particular things

**1 . Non SSL requests**

All most every requests made by UC browser to UC browser’s server was using plain HTTP . I did not analyse the requests as most off them has lots of parameters . I need to investigate more

**2.UC browser was sending all your visited website to their servers**

Next I tried to visit my high school website . So i typed the url and pressed enter . UC browser made a POST request to logssug.ucweb.com and it was using http and not https . The request had the url and you vistied or the term you googled and some other parameters/values . So any one on the network can intercept and see what website an user is visiting. Plus I see no point to send the website requested by you to a logging server

![]()

Thats my google search

![]()

Thats the website I visited

**More TRACKING !**

So after poking some time I found another request . UC browser was sending tons of data in this request not just the URL you visited or the term you googled . The endpoint is [http://gjtrack.ucweb.com/collec](http://gjtrack.ucweb.com)t . UC browser was sending the domain you visited ,your city,country,state ,your isp . Thats a lot of tracking for a browser .

![]()

The redacted part contains my location

**Incognito Mode**

So you might be thinking what about incognito mode . Its all the same . Even in incognito mode you get the all the trackers I mentioned above . UC browser does not care about your privacy . So just stop using it

**Note for the non technical people:**

The above paragraphs may be too hard to read for general public . So here is a simplified version

1.UC browser sends the website you visit to servers controlled by them . They logs your web browsing history,your google searches . They also sends the data in plain text which means any third party can intercept that . Suppose you are reading a manga on UC browser and you are using public wifi . So a malicious user using that wifi will be able to intercept the data sent by UC and read it . The data has the term you searched on Google or the website you visited

2.Incognito mode does not do shit

3. UC browser also sends data such as the current domain you are on,your isp,country,state,city . If you gave location access uc browser sends your gps cordinates too .

4. UC is a Chinese company. There is a law in China . According to that law Chinese companies have to give their data when ever the government asks . Suppose a war breaks out with China . China can and will use the data to run an information warfare on a huge scale against Indians . So for your privacy and national security its better if you guys uninstall that shit . There are lots of better options. Some chinese apps are already banned by MOD which means defense guys can’t use that app
