# Double free when calling `sys\_info::disk\_info` from multiple threads
Affected versions of `sys-info` use a static, global, list to store temporary disk information while running. The function that cleans up this list,
`DFCleanup`, assumes a single threaded environment and will try to free the same memory twice in a multithreaded environment.
This results in consistent double-frees and segfaults when calling `sys\_info::disk\_info` from multiple threads at once.
The issue was fixed by moving the global variable into a local scope.

## Description

![@cetra3](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6415435?v=4&size=48)[cetra3](https://github.com/cetra3)opened [on Jun 1, 2020](https://github.com/FillZpp/sys-info-rs/issues/63#issue-628119066)

I've seen a few segmentation faults when running `disk_info()` on linux.

If you call `disk_info()` from multiple threads at once this can core dump:

```
#5  0x00005585db2e28cc in DFcleanup () at c/linux.c:167
#6  0x00005585db2e265f in get_disk_info () at c/linux.c:117
#7  0x00005585db2cee4a in sys_info::disk_info () at /home/cetra/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/sys-info-0.6.0/lib.rs:494

```

There is a global `DFhashvector`:

[sys-info-rs/c/linux.c](https://github.com/FillZpp/sys-info-rs/blob/a5d126df70a8403a3dd02e3b7b0fe750caae844e/c/linux.c#L19)

Line 19
in
[a5d126d](/FillZpp/sys-info-rs/commit/a5d126df70a8403a3dd02e3b7b0fe750caae844e)

|  | static struct nlist \*DFhashvector[DFHASHSIZE]; |
| --- | --- |

Which, if two threads are calling `disk_info()` the `DFCleanup()` call at the end of the `get_disk_info()` function will both try and free at the same time:

[sys-info-rs/c/linux.c](https://github.com/FillZpp/sys-info-rs/blob/a5d126df70a8403a3dd02e3b7b0fe750caae844e/c/linux.c#L159-L172)

Lines 159 to 172
in
[a5d126d](/FillZpp/sys-info-rs/commit/a5d126df70a8403a3dd02e3b7b0fe750caae844e)

|  | void DFcleanup() |
| --- | --- |
|  | { |
|  | struct nlist \*np, \*next; |
|  | int i; |
|  | for (i=0; i<DFHASHSIZE; i++) { |
|  | /\* Non-standard for loop. Note the last clause happens at the end of the loop. \*/ |
|  | for (np = DFhashvector[i]; np; np=next) { |
|  | next=np->next; |
|  | free(np->name); |
|  | free(np); |
|  | } |
|  | DFhashvector[i] = 0; |
|  | } |
|  | } |

This results in segfaults & also double frees

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
