Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a static, global list (`DFhashvector`) in the `sys-info` crate to store temporary disk information. The cleanup function `DFCleanup` assumes a single-threaded environment and attempts to free the same memory multiple times when `sys_info::disk_info` is called concurrently from multiple threads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Concurrency Issue:** The code is not thread-safe, leading to race conditions when multiple threads access and modify the shared global list concurrently.
- **Double Free:** The `DFCleanup` function attempts to free memory that has already been freed by another thread, resulting in a double free.
- **Memory Corruption:** Double frees lead to memory corruption, which is a critical vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Segfaults/Crashes:** The primary impact is the occurrence of segmentation faults and program crashes due to memory corruption.
- **Denial of Service:**  The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service by crashing the application.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Although not explicitly stated, memory corruption vulnerabilities like double-frees can sometimes be exploited for more severe consequences like arbitrary code execution, depending on the memory layout and how the program is compiled.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Multithreaded Execution:** The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `sys_info::disk_info` function from multiple threads concurrently.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Execute Code Concurrently:** An attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable function `sys_info::disk_info` from multiple threads within the application. This could be achieved by introducing multiple threads that call this function either directly or indirectly.
- **No Special Privileges:** No specific user privileges are needed for exploitation, since the vulnerability exists within the code itself and can be triggered by a regular user.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
- The `DFhashvector` is a global static array of pointers to `nlist` structs.
- The `DFCleanup` function iterates through this array and frees the `name` and the `nlist` structure pointed to by each entry
- Concurrent calls to `sys_info::disk_info` lead to the `DFCleanup` function being called multiple times which cause a double free due to each thread attempting to free the same memory region.
- The fix was to move the global `DFhashvector` into a local scope to prevent concurrent access issues.

**CVE Information:**
- CVE-2020-36434 is assigned to this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in `sys-info` crate versions before 0.8.0.
- The vulnerability is specific to Linux systems.
- CVSS score: 9.8 (Critical)
- CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is related to CWE-415 (Double Free).
- The github issue ([https://github.com/FillZpp/sys-info-rs/issues/63](https://github.com/FillZpp/sys-info-rs/issues/63)) provides details and stack traces related to the crash.
- The fix involves moving the static global variable into a local scope to prevent concurrency issues.
