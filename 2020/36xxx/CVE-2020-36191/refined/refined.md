Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The JupyterHub application's admin panel for adding and deleting users relies solely on the `Referer` header for CSRF protection, instead of using anti-CSRF techniques like Double Submit Cookie.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient CSRF Protection:** The application does not properly implement CSRF protection mechanisms. It relies only on the `Referer` header, which can be unreliable and bypassed. Specifically, the `_xsrf` token is not properly validated, rendering it ineffective.
- **Missing Double Submit Cookie Implementation:**  The application lacks the implementation of the Double Submit Cookie technique which would effectively prevent CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized User Management:** An attacker can perform unauthorized user management actions (add or delete users) on the JupyterHub application.
- **Compromised System Security:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a compromised system through unauthorized user manipulation.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can potentially use this vulnerability to gain further access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **CSRF Attack:** An attacker could craft malicious links or HTML forms that, when opened by an authenticated user, could execute actions (adding or deleting users) on the JupyterHub admin panel. This would occur without the user's awareness or consent.
- **Browser plugin / escape techniques:** Malicious browser plugins or other techniques could be used to bypass `Referer` header checks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Target User Interaction:** The attacker needs the target admin user to interact with a malicious link or form.
- **Authentication:** The attacker does not need to know the user's credentials since the attack relies on the user being already authenticated to the JupyterHub admin panel.

**Additional details:**
The provided Github issue report (#3304) shows screenshots of adding and deleting users without the `_xsrf` token. The issue also references the OWASP Cross-Site Request Forgery Prevention Cheat Sheet, highlighting the recommended practice of using techniques such as the Double Submit Cookie pattern. The issue confirms that the `_xsrf` token is not being validated by the server.
