## Description

![@jhespeter](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5623182?u=f25dea0d4121c09556e8f328507e007eef273155&v=4&size=48)[jhespeter](https://github.com/jhespeter)opened [on Dec 11, 2020](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/issues/3304#issue-761789976)
### Bug description

In JupyterHub's Admin panel, the \_xsrf token is not working for add/delete user features.

Current mechanism to protect add/delete user features against CSRF attack is solely rely on checking the Referer header value.

Although current referer header examination seems to be strict enough, it could still be bypassed if user is fooled to install malicious browser plugin or there exists any escape techniques.

#### Expected behaviour

Implement anti-CSRF techniques like Double Submit Cookie, so that JupyterHub could prevent CSRF attack.

#### Actual behaviour

Even if the \_xsrf token is removed the add/delete user requests could still be accepted & processed by server.

That could lead to a possible CSRF attack.

Screen Capture of successfully deleting user without \_xsrf token

### How to reproduce

1. Log in JupyterHub console with admin privilege
2. Click Control Panel button
3. Click Admin tab
4. Click Add User button / Delete User button
5. Use proxy technique to intercept the packet sent
6. Modify the packet by removing the \_xsrf token
7. Send the request & see the request is accepted

### Your personal set up

* OS:

  Kubernetes 1.12 + , Helm charts 3.0 + , ubi 7.8+
* Version(s):

  JupyterHub 1.1.0, Python 3.8
