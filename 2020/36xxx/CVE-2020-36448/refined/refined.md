Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36448:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `cache` crate incorrectly implements `Send` and `Sync` traits for the `Cache<K>` type without placing necessary trait bounds on the key type `K`. This allows users to insert types for `K` that do not satisfy the `Send` or `Sync` constraints.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Unconditional `Send`/`Sync` implementation for `Cache<K>`.
- Lack of trait bounds on the key type `K`.
- Potential for data races when using non-`Send` types like `Arc<Cell<T>>` or `Rc<T>` as keys.
- Potential for data races when using non-`Sync` but `Send` types like `Cell<T>` or `RefCell<T>` as keys.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Creation of data races due to unsynchronized access to shared mutable data.
- Memory corruption can occur as a result of these data races.
- High confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact as a result of the memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**

- Network (AV:N)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- No privileges are required (PR:N).
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).
- Attack complexity is high (AC:H), indicating that exploitation might not be straightforward.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions <= 0.2.0 of the `cache` crate
- No patched version is available.
- The vulnerability is categorized under memory corruption and thread-safety.
