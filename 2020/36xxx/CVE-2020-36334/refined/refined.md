Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The ThemeGrill Demo Importer plugin for WordPress had a function that could reset the WordPress database to its default state, triggered by the `do_reset_wordpress` GET parameter via the `admin-ajax.php` interface. This function lacked authentication and authorization checks in versions prior to 1.6.2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unauthenticated Database Reset:** The core vulnerability was the ability for any unauthenticated user to trigger a database reset.
2.  **Authentication Bypass (with specific conditions):** If a user named "admin" existed in the database, the reset function would log the attacker in as this admin user after the database reset.
3.  **CSRF vulnerability**: The fix in version 1.6.2 only added an authentication check but lacked CSRF protection, which allowed an attacker to trick an authenticated admin user into triggering the reset.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Data Loss:**  The primary impact was the complete loss of existing WordPress data as the database was reset to its initial state.
2.  **Site Takeover:** When an "admin" user exists, successful exploitation allowed the attacker to gain full administrative control of the WordPress site.
3.  **Malicious Code Execution:**  Once logged in as admin, an attacker could install plugins and gain code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Direct HTTP GET Request (Versions < 1.6.2):** Attackers could trigger the vulnerability by crafting a simple GET request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `do_reset_wordpress` parameter set.
2.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Version 1.6.2):** After the initial fix, an attacker could use CSRF to trick an admin user into submitting a POST request that triggers the database reset.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Versions < 1.6.2:** No authentication or prior access was required. The attacker only needed the URL of the vulnerable site.
2.  **Version 1.6.2:** No prior access required. The attacker had to lure an admin user to trigger a malicious POST request.
3.  **General:** Attacker needed to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability existed in the plugin since version 1.3.4.
*   The vulnerability was being actively exploited in the wild, with a significant number of attacks blocked after the patch release.
*   The patch in version 1.6.3 added a nonce check to prevent CSRF attacks.
*   The plugin is intended for theme development/testing and should be removed from production sites when not in use.

**Timeline:**
*   06-02-2020 - Issue discovery and patch released for Patchstack customers, reported to the developer.
*   11-02-2020 - Second attempt to reach out to the developer.
*   14-02-2020 - Received email from the developer, resent the issue.
