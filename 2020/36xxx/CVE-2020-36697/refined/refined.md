Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36697:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the WP GDPR plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The plugin fails to properly verify user permissions before allowing access to sensitive functions.
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Unauthenticated attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that gets stored in the database and executed when other users access affected pages.
*  **Content Spoofing:** Attackers can manipulate the `comments` table in the database, modifying comment content, user assignments, and moderation status.
*   **Arbitrary Comment Deletion:** Unauthenticated attackers can delete any comment.
*   **Plugin Settings Modification:** Unauthenticated users can change the plugin's configurations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Through stored XSS, an attacker can execute malicious JavaScript in the browsers of unsuspecting users, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or other harmful actions.
*   **Data Tampering:** Attackers can alter comment contents, impersonate users by changing user assignments, and bypass moderation, leading to misinformation or defacement.
*   **Denial of Service:** Deletion of arbitrary comments can lead to content loss.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Modification of plugin settings can potentially grant attackers further access or control over the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests.
*   **Unauthenticated access:** No login or prior authorization is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker does not require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability, only network access to the vulnerable website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable plugin is "WP GDPR" for WordPress, versions 2.1.1 and below.
*   The plugin is no longer maintained, and a fix is not available.
*   The plugin was removed from the WordPress repository after the vulnerability was reported.
