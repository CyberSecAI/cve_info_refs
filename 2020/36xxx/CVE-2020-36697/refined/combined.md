***Tip:** You can search by CVE ID, software name or slug, or the researcher name. Expand to read about more advanced search options.*

If you want to perform more advanced lookups, you can use **keywords** to further refine your search.

For example, `woocommerce researcher:"chloe chamberland"` would search for any vulnerabilities discovered by Chloe Chamberland in software that has WooCommerce in the title.

Keywords are added in `keyword:value` format. If the value contains spaces, you must enclose it in quotation marks.

You can use the following keywords to add criteria to your search:

title
Searches through the title of each vulnerability for matches.

date
Returns vulnerabilities by publication date. Use `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY` format.

cvss-rating
Use `low`, `medium`, `high` or `critical` to limit the search to vulnerabilities with the specified rating.

researcher
Returns vulnerabilities credited to researchers containing the given text.

software
Returns vulnerabilities discovered in software containing the given text.

software-slug
Returns vulnerabilities discovered in software exactly matching the given slug.

software-type
Use `plugin`, `theme` or `core` to limit the search to the specified type of software.

By selecting “Search” you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the Wordfence Intelligence Terms and Conditions.

# Unauthenticated stored XSS and content spoofing vulnerabilities in WordPress WP GDPR plugin (unpatched).

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [April 23, 2020 - 10:54am [+0700]January 21, 2021 - 6:25pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/unauthenticated-stored-xss-and-content-spoofing-vulnerabilities-in-wordpress-wp-gdpr-plugin-unpatched/)

> This plugin is not maintained any longer and the vulnerability has never been fixed. Make sure to follow the recommendations below.

The WordPress [WP GDPR plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gdpr-core/), which has 6,000+ active installations, is prone to multiple vulnerabilities affecting version 2.1.1 and below.

Improper access control and unvalidated user input can lead to:

* Stored XSS: An unauthenticated attacker can inject JavaScript code that will be triggered when someone accesses a page or post that has a comment form:![](../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wp-gdpr-core-stored-xss-vulnerability.png)

* Content Spoofing: An unauthenticated attacker can gain full control over the WordPress `comments` table in the database and can tamper with any of its 14 fields: change the content of all comments, assign them to another user or to another post, bypass moderation/approval etc.

* Additional issue: An unauthenticated attacker can delete any comment as well as modify the plugin’s settings.

Because all issues are unfixed we won’t provide more details.

### Timeline

The vulnerability was reported to the wordpress.org team on October 22, 2019 and the plugin was removed from the repo.

### Recommendations

**We recommend to uninstall this plugin as there isn’t any security patch available.** If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability since October 2019.

# WordPress Plugin WP GDPR Multiple Vulnerabilities (2.1.1)

## Description

WordPress Plugin WP GDPR is prone to multiple vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting and security bypass. Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or to perform otherwise restricted actions and subsequently modify plugin's settings, delete any comment or tamper with "comments" table in the database. WordPress Plugin WP GDPR version 2.1.1 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.

## Remediation

Disable the plugin until a fix is available
