Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36155:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of sufficient input validation in the user registration form of the Ultimate Member plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to properly sanitize user-submitted data, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary user meta keys during the registration process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted User Meta Updates:** The plugin allows users to supply arbitrary meta keys, including sensitive ones like `wp_capabilities`, during registration.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `update_profile` function processes submitted data without proper validation, directly updating the database with user-provided meta values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating the `wp_capabilities` meta field, an attacker can grant themselves administrator privileges upon registration.
*   **Full Site Takeover:** Once an attacker gains administrator access, they have full control over the WordPress site, enabling them to perform any malicious action, including taking the site offline, injecting malware, or stealing data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Registration Form Manipulation:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by submitting a crafted registration request containing the `wp_capabilities[administrator]` parameter, effectively granting themselves admin privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated User:** The attacker does not need to have an existing account on the targeted WordPress site.
*   **Ability to Access the Registration Form:** The attacker must be able to access the user registration form provided by the Ultimate Member plugin.
*   **Knowledge of User Meta Keys:** While the specific vulnerability focuses on `wp_capabilities`, it also makes other user meta keys vulnerable to manipulation.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as **CRITICAL** with a CVSS score of 10.0.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.12 of the Ultimate Member plugin.
*   Wordfence Premium users received protection against this vulnerability on October 23, 2020, while free users received it on November 22, 2020.
