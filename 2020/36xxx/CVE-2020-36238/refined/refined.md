- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing permissions check in the `/rest/api/1.0/render` resource.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to send a request to the render API resource and determine if a given username is valid.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can enumerate valid usernames on the Jira instance, which can be used in combination with other attacks such as password spraying.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, anonymous access to the `/rest/api/1.0/render` resource.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special capabilities or access are required. The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
