# `Decoder` can carry `R: !Send` to other threads
Affected versions of this crate implements `Send` for `Decoder` for any `R: Read`. This allows `Decoder` to contain `R: !Send` and carry (move) it to another thread.
This can result in undefined behavior such as memory corruption from data race on `R`, or dropping `R = MutexGuard<\_>` from a thread that didn't lock the mutex.
The flaw was corrected in commit a34d6e1 by adding trait bound `R: Send` to the `Send` impl for `Decoder`.

## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Nov 10, 2020](https://github.com/mvertescher/libsbc-rs/issues/4#issue-739679503)

The `Send` trait for `Decoder` should probably be `R: Read + Sync` here:

[libsbc-rs/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/mvertescher/libsbc-rs/blob/7278b23901f93d956d9739fdfc4ced147cc3f242/src/lib.rs#L34-L38)

Lines 34 to 38
in
[7278b23](/mvertescher/libsbc-rs/commit/7278b23901f93d956d9739fdfc4ced147cc3f242)

|  | unsafe impl<R> Send for Decoder<R> |
| --- | --- |
|  | where |
|  | R: Read, |
|  | { |
|  | } |

otherwise it's possible to send `Read` instances across threads that might not support it. For example `std::io::StdinLock` is a `Read` but is not `Send`. However, wrapping it in a `Decoder` allows it to be sent across threads:

```
use libsbc::Decoder;

use std::io;
use static_assertions::{assert_not_impl_all, assert_impl_all};

fn main() {
    assert_not_impl_all!(io::StdinLock : Send);
    assert_not_impl_all!(Decoder<io::StdinLock> : Send);
}
```

fails with an assertion error because `Send` is implemented. (Issue found by [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)'s Rust group)

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
