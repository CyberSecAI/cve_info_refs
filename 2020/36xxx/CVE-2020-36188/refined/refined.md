    {
      "ID": "CVE-2020-36188",
      "Description": "FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.10.8 mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing, related to com.newrelic.agent.deps.ch.qos.logback.core.db.JNDICS." ,
       "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of serialization gadgets in conjunction with typing, specifically when dealing with the `com.newrelic.agent.deps.ch.qos.logback.core.db.JNDICS` class.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Insecure deserialization",
        "Improper handling of serialization gadgets",
         "Polymorphic typing misuse"
      ],
      "Impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, exposing sensitive data, or a denial of service (DoS).",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Crafted JSON payloads",
        "Deserialization of untrusted data"
      ],
      "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft a specific JSON message that includes a malicious gadget type. The service must have the `logback-classic` library in its classpath, and polymorphic type handling has to be enabled."
