The provided content relates to CVE-2020-36642.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `cputime` parameter in the `LanguageTask.php` file was not being properly sanitized before being used in a command, leading to command injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: Unsanitized user-controlled input (`cputime` parameter) is directly inserted into a system command executed by the webserver user `www-data`.
- Privilege Escalation: After gaining web server user access through the command injection, the attacker could modify the `runguard` to allow root user execution of commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Command Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server with the privileges of the webserver user.
- Privilege Escalation: An attacker can potentially gain root access by modifying `runguard` and executing commands as root.

**Attack vectors:**
- The `cputime` parameter is provided by user input via a web request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the webserver with a malicious `cputime` parameter.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the webroot after gaining initial access to patch runguard.
