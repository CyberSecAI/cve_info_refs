```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to excessive recursion during the parsing of a crafted JavaScript expression. The parser functions call each other recursively without bound, eventually overflowing the stack.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unbounded recursion in the parser functions leading to a stack overflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service due to stack overflow, leading to program termination.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted JavaScript code that causes the parser to enter into an infinite or excessively deep recursive loop.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide crafted JavaScript input to the vulnerable parser."
