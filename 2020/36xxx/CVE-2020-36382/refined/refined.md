Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36382:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the OpenVPN 2 codebase, which is used by OpenVPN Access Server for VPN connections. Specifically, it's related to how deferred authentication is handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication Bypass: A remote attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms.
- Access Control Channel Data Leakage: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to control channel data.
- Potential Information Leaks: Control channel data could be leveraged to trigger further information leaks.
- Remote Script Exposure: If the client-side scripting feature is enabled, scripts could be exposed to unauthorized access.
- Sensitive Data Compromise: If the exposed client-side scripts contain sensitive information, this could be compromised by the attacker.
- Denial of Service: A similar method can be used to launch a Denial of Service attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to control channel data.
- Potential information leaks of sensitive data.
- Potential access to protected networks.
- Exposure of client-side scripts, potentially including sensitive data within those scripts.
- Denial of Service.
- Severity is high to critical depending on the gained information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
