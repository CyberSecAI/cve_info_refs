# Simplifying Secure Networking with IPsec

### January 28, 2025 at 10:00 AM PT

Unlock the power of seamless connectivity with CloudConnexa’s latest feature, enabling easy connection of private networks using IPsec. Whether you're managing a hybrid cloud infrastructure or securing remote access, this new functionality simplifies the configuration of secure site-to-site networking and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) by leveraging IPsec—a protocol widely supported by most IaaS providers and routers.

Join our free webinar to learn how CloudConnexa now supports IPsec connections across a range of platforms, including Cisco, AWS, Azure, and GCP, along with a general IPsec setup for other environments. In this session, we will cover:

* **IPsec connection simplified:** We’ll walk through step-by-step guidance on how to configure IPsec between private networks for both **site-to-site connectivity** and **remote access.**
* **Platform-Specific Configuration:** You’ll gain detailed instructions for integrating IPsec with **Cisco, AWS, Azure, and GCP** environments.
* **Demonstration:** Watch a live demo of how to configure an IPsec tunnel to **AWS** and securely access private applications within your AWS VPC remotely.

Don't miss this opportunity to streamline your network configurations and enable faster connectivity across cloud platforms. **Register today!**

## Description:

OpenVPN Access Server uses OpenVPN 2 codebase at its core for VPN connections. This codebase contains a vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to bypass authentication and access control channel data on servers configured with deferred authentication. It is possible that this control channel data could be used to trigger further information leaks or gain access to protected networks. If the client-side scripting feature is in use, these scripts could be obtained through such an attack. If those scripts contain sensitive information, this information could be compromised. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have a valid, user-locked or auto-login client profile for the vulnerable Access Server, or credentials to obtain such a profile. Although exploiting this vulnerability requires some preparation on the attackerâs side, the severity of a successful attack is high to critical, depending on the gained information. Additionally it was found that it was possible to do a Denial of Service attack using a similar method in the OpenVPN Access Server. We therefore strongly recommend upgrading your Access Server to the latest version to address the vulnerability.

## Resolution:

Update your OpenVPN Access Server to version 2.8.8 as soon as possible, which contains the fix for this vulnerability. The procedure on how to upgrade Access Server can be found here: [Keeping OpenVPN Access Server Updated](https://openvpn.net/vpn-server-resources/keeping-openvpn-access-server-updated/). The CVEâs we published for this are [CVE-2020-36382](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-36382) and [CVE-2020-15077](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15077) and are related to the open source OpenVPN 2 project CVE report [CVE-2020-15078](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15078).
