## Description

![@schrewe](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73848196?v=4&size=48)[schrewe](https://github.com/schrewe)opened [on Nov 2, 2020](https://github.com/COVESA/dlt-daemon/issues/265#issue-734733134)

Hello,

I have fuzzed dlt-daemon to search for bugs using the Tool [CI-Fuzz](https://www.code-intelligence.com/). I think I found a write heap buffer overflow in the function dlt\_buffer\_write\_block. You can find the full crash report below. This is from a fuzz test I wrote to execute the function dlt\_buffer\_push with fuzzer generated inputs.

After having a look at the code it seems that there is no size check before writing to the ring buffer: There is no check if size<=buf->size in dlt\_buffer\_write\_block.

As far as I can say this condition isn't checked elsewhere. Since buffer overflows can often be used to get arbitrary code execution this is a potential security issue. Using the dlt\_daemon\_client\_send function a connected dlt user could write into the memory of the daemon and possibly gain arbitrary code execution.

I think this could be fixed by changing the if condition in dlt\_common.c:2508 (in function dlt\_buffer\_push3) into a while loop.

If you need further information or discussion I'm happy to help as far as I can.

Package        : dlt-daemon
Version        : 2.18.0-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-29394 CVE-2020-36244 CVE-2022-31291
Debian Bug     : 976228 1014534

dlt-daemon, a Diagnostic Log and Trace logging daemon, had the following
vulnerabilities reported:

CVE-2020-29394

    A buffer overflow in the dlt_filter_load function in dlt_common.c
    from dlt-daemon allows arbitrary code execution because fscanf is
    misused (no limit on the number of characters to be read in the
    format argument).

CVE-2020-36244

    dlt-daemon was vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow that
    could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-31291

    An issue in dlt_config_file_parser.c of dlt-daemon allows attackers
    to cause a double free via crafted TCP packets.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.18.0-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dlt-daemon packages.

For the detailed security status of dlt-daemon please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/dlt-daemon>

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
