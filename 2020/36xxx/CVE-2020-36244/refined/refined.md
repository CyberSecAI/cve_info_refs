Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36244:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing size check in the `dlt_buffer_write_block` function within the `dlt-daemon` software. Specifically, the code doesn't verify if the size of the data being written exceeds the allocated buffer size before performing the memory copy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow. This occurs when data is written beyond the allocated memory region in the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution. By overflowing the heap buffer, an attacker could overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially including return addresses or function pointers. This can lead to gaining control of the application's execution flow.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, as a connected dlt user can trigger the buffer overflow by sending malicious data to the dlt-daemon via `dlt_daemon_client_send`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Exploitation:**  The attack vector involves a network connection to the dlt-daemon. A malicious dlt user can send crafted messages to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access to the dlt-daemon:** An attacker needs to be able to connect to the dlt-daemon.
*   **Ability to send messages:** The attacker must be capable of sending messages via the dlt protocol to the dlt-daemon.
*   **Knowledge of the protocol/data format:**  The attacker would require some knowledge of the dlt protocol or data format to craft the malicious messages that cause the overflow.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was found through fuzzing with the `CI-Fuzz` tool by user `schrewe`.
*   The vulnerable function, `dlt_buffer_write_block`, is located in `dlt_common.c`.
*   The suggested fix involves changing the `if` condition to a `while` loop in `dlt_common.c:2508` within the function `dlt_buffer_push3`.
