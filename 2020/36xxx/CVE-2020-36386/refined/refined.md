Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36386:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content clearly relates to CVE-2020-36386. The syzkaller bug report, the commit message, and the SyzScope analysis all point to a vulnerability in the `hci_extended_inquiry_result_evt` function within the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is an insufficient check on the `num_rsp` variable within the `hci_extended_inquiry_result_evt` function. This variable represents the number of responses in an extended inquiry result event. When a malformed event packet with a large `num_rsp` is received, the function attempts to iterate through the responses using this value.  If `num_rsp` is larger than the actual number of responses available in the buffer, it leads to an out-of-bounds read when accessing the `info` array, which triggers a slab-out-of-bounds read in `memcpy` via `bacpy` macro.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Slab-out-of-bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is a slab-out-of-bounds read. The code iterates based on `num_rsp` without verifying that it is not exceeding the actual size of the received data.
*   **Arbitrary Value Write:** Because the out-of-bounds read occurs on a freed memory region, subsequent accesses to the corrupted `info` pointer lead to arbitrary value writes in the `hci_extended_inquiry_result_evt` function. Specifically, the code writes to fields like `pscan_rep_mode`, `pscan_period_mode`, `dev_class`, `clock_offset`, and `rssi` using the corrupted pointer.
*   **Use-after-free (indirect):** The slab out-of-bounds read occurs on a freed memory region.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Crash:** The out-of-bounds read can trigger a kernel crash (KASAN report) due to accessing invalid memory.
*   **Arbitrary Memory Corruption:** The arbitrary value writes can lead to unpredictable behavior, potentially causing data corruption, privilege escalation, or further vulnerabilities within the kernel's Bluetooth stack, although the exact impact is difficult to define.

**5. Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Bluetooth Device/Packet:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Bluetooth packet with a large `num_rsp` value to a vulnerable device. This could be achieved by an attacker within Bluetooth range of the target device.
*   **Virtual HCI Interface:** As shown in the provided syzkaller test case, the vulnerability can be triggered through the `/dev/vhci` virtual HCI device. This allows for testing the vulnerability without the need of a physical Bluetooth interface, or from a sandboxed environment where a virtual interface is used.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker must be within Bluetooth range of the target device or be able to interact with the virtual hci device, either directly or through some application running on the target machine.
*   **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious Bluetooth packet with a large `num_rsp` field.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by syzbot.
*   The fix involves checking the length of the sk\_buff in the hci\_extended\_inquiry\_result\_evt function to make sure it has enough bytes before accessing the `info` array: `if (!num_rsp || skb->len < num_rsp * sizeof(*info) + 1) return;`
*   The vulnerability exists in multiple kernel versions, with reports showing crashes in versions 4.14, 4.19, and 5.x.
*   SyzScope analysis provides detailed traces of the crash and highlights the arbitrary value write vulnerability.
*   The syzkaller reproducer provides a way to trigger the vulnerability through the virtual hci device.

In summary, CVE-2020-36386 describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth subsystem that allows an attacker to trigger a slab-out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash and potentially arbitrary value writes, by sending a malformed Bluetooth packet or interacting through a virtual device. The vulnerability is addressed with the patch 51c19bf3d5cf which adds the necessary check to make sure the received data is consistent with the expected number of responses.
