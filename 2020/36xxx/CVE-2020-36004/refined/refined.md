The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input before it's used in an SQL query. Specifically, the `now` parameter in the `download_frame.php` script is passed directly to a SQL query without any filtering or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in `download_frame.php`.
- Unsanitized user input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- This can potentially lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the application's database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The `now` parameter in the URL: `/dawn/download_frame.php?m=list&s=1&end=10&now=[SQL_injection_payload]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be logged into the admin panel of the application, as the vulnerability is located in the admin section.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable URL.
