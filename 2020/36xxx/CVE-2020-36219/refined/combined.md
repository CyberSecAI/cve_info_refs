### Description

In the affected versions of this crate,
`AtomicOption<T>` unconditionally implements `Sync`.

This allows programmers to move non-Sync types across thread boundaries (e.g. `Rc<T>`, `Arc<Cell<T>>`), which can lead to data races and undefined behavior.
It is also possible to send non-Send types like `std::sync::MutexGuard` to other threads, which can lead to undefined behavior.

## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Oct 31, 2020](https://github.com/reem/rust-atomic-option/issues/4#issue-733797419)

Currently `AtomicOption` implements `Sync` for any type. However, this should really be bounded by `T: Sync`, otherwise it allows for types that were never meant to be used across threads to be smuggled across boundaries through the use of an `&AtomicOption`. (Issue found by [@Qwaz](https://github.com/Qwaz)).

See this example of using `AtomicOption` to use a `Cell` across thread boundaries, leading to an arbitrary pointer dereference:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use atomic_option::AtomicOption;

use crossbeam_utils::thread;
use std::{cell::Cell, sync::atomic::Ordering};

static SOME_INT: u64 = 123;

fn main() {
    #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
    enum RefOrInt<'a> {
        Ref(&'a u64),
        Int(u64),
    }
    let cell = Cell::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));

    let atomic_opt = AtomicOption::new(Box::new(&cell));
    let ref_to_atomic_opt = &atomic_opt;

    thread::scope(|s| {
        s.spawn(move |_| {
            let cell_in_thread = *(ref_to_atomic_opt.take(Ordering::Relaxed).unwrap());
            println!("Thread - {:p} - {:?}", cell_in_thread, cell_in_thread);

            loop {
                // Repeatedly write Ref(&addr) and Int(0xdeadbeef) into the cell.
                cell_in_thread.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
                cell_in_thread.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
            }
        });

        println!("Main - {:p} - {:?}", &cell, cell);
        loop {
            if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = cell.get() {
                // Hope that between the time we pattern match the object as a
                // `Ref`, it gets written to by the other thread.
                if addr as *const u64 == &SOME_INT as *const u64 {
                    continue;
                }

                // Due to the data race, obtaining Ref(0xdeadbeef) is possible
                println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
                println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
            }
        }
    });
}
```

Output:

```
Main - 0x7ffe55b08f58 - Cell { value: Ref(123) }
Thread - 0x7ffe55b08f58 - Cell { value: Ref(123) }
Pointer is now: 0xdeadbeef

```

Return Code: -11 (SIGSEGV)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
