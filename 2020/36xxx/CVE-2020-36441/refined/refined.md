Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36441:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `AtomicBox<T>` in the `abox` crate incorrectly implemented the `Send` and `Sync` traits for any type `T` that is `Sized`, without requiring that `T` also implements `Send` and `Sync`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Trait Implementations:** The `Send` and `Sync` traits were implemented unconditionally, bypassing Rust's compile-time thread safety checks.
*   **Data Races:** This flaw allowed the creation of data races when using types that are not `Sync` (like `Cell`), leading to undefined behavior.
*   **Violation of Thread Safety Guarantees:** It breaks Rust's thread safety guarantees, potentially causing memory corruption and other unexpected issues within safe Rust code.
*   **Sending !Send Types to other Threads:** It allows the user to send types that are not `Send` to other threads, resulting in undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Data races can lead to memory corruption.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** The vulnerability allows users to introduce undefined behavior using safe Rust code.
*   **Program Crashes (Segfault):** The provided demonstration shows a scenario that can cause segmentation faults.
*   **Unpredictable Program State:** The program can reach an invalid state due to data races.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by using the `AtomicBox` with a type `T` that is not `Send` or `Sync`, then transferring the `AtomicBox` instance to another thread.
*   No network or direct interaction with the system is required for exploitation. This is all within the process.
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to use the vulnerable `abox` crate.
*   No specific privileges or user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attacker must be able to create and manage threads within a Rust program.
*   The attacker must have knowledge of how to utilize non-`Send` or non-`Sync` types within the `AtomicBox` structure.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed by adding trait bounds to the `Send` and `Sync` implementations for `AtomicBox<T>`, requiring `T: Send` and `T: Sync` respectively.
*   The provided code demonstration clearly showcases how a data race can occur due to the missing trait bounds, leading to a segmentation fault.
