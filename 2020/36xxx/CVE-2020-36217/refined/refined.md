Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36217:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `may_queue` crate in Rust, specifically its `Queue` type. The `Queue` type incorrectly implemented the `Send` and `Sync` traits without proper bounds, meaning it did not restrict itself to types that are actually safe to send and share between threads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of `Send`/`Sync` Bounds:** The primary weakness is the missing restriction on the types that can be stored in the `Queue`. It allows non-`Sync` types, like `Cell`, to be shared across threads, which is unsafe and leads to data races.
*   **Data Race:** The lack of proper synchronization when sharing mutable data structures across threads leads to data races, where multiple threads attempt to access and modify the same memory location concurrently without proper coordination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Due to data races, memory can be corrupted, leading to undefined behavior. This can manifest in various forms, including incorrect data values and program crashes.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** The use of non-`Sync` types in concurrent contexts leads to undefined behavior, which is unpredictable and can be difficult to debug.
*   **Denial of Service:** The potential for crashes due to memory corruption and undefined behavior can result in denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** While the vulnerability is triggered through unsafe concurrent code, the CVSS vector indicates that the attack vector is network based, likely implying that network services using vulnerable versions could be impacted remotely by a crafted request or payload that makes use of the concurrency issues.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The vulnerability does not require any specific user privileges to exploit.
*   **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.
*   **Concurrent Program:** The attacker needs to introduce a scenario where a concurrent program is using the flawed queue implementation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was reported on November 10, 2020, and a fix was released in version 0.1.8 of the `may_queue` crate.
*   The provided code demonstrates a data race using `std::cell::Cell` and the `may_queue::mpsc_list::Queue`, which leads to a segmentation fault due to memory corruption.
*   The vulnerability is tracked under multiple identifiers including `CVE-2020-36217`, `RUSTSEC-2020-0111`, and `GHSA-pphf-f93w-gc84`.

In summary, CVE-2020-36217 is a thread safety issue in the `may_queue` crate due to the lack of `Send`/`Sync` bounds on its `Queue` type. This allows non-thread-safe types to be shared between threads, leading to data races, memory corruption, and potential crashes.
