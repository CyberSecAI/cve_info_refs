Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-36567

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the default logger middleware in the `gin-gonic/gin` framework not sanitizing user-controlled input within the request path. Specifically, the logging format used `fmt.Sprintf`, which allowed format string specifiers in the request path to be interpreted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Log Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary log entries by crafting malicious request paths that contain format string specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%v`, etc.).
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The default logger does not sanitize the request path before incorporating it into log messages, which allows for exploitation.
- **Use of `fmt.Sprintf`:** The use of `fmt.Sprintf` to construct log messages without proper sanitization makes it vulnerable to format string injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Log Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary log lines, potentially overwriting or corrupting existing logs.
- **Log Spoofing:** Attackers can manipulate log data to create misleading or false log entries, potentially hiding malicious activity or disrupting incident response efforts.
- **Denial of Service (Potential):** While not explicitly mentioned in the provided texts, in some cases log injection might lead to a denial of service if the injected log lines exhaust resources.
- **Information Disclosure (Potential):** Though not specified, crafted format strings *could* also be used to disclose sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Path Manipulation:** Attackers exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the request path of HTTP requests sent to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **No Privileges Required:** No specific privileges or authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects `github.com/gin-gonic/gin` versions prior to v1.6.0.
- The fix involves changing the logging format to use `%#v` instead of `%s` to print the raw string value.
- The vulnerability was addressed in commit `a71af9c144f9579f6dbe945341c1df37aaf09c0d`.
- The vulnerability is also tracked as GHSA-6vm3-jj99-7229 and GO-2020-0001.

In summary, CVE-2020-36567 is a log injection vulnerability in the `gin-gonic/gin` framework due to improper sanitization of user-controlled input in the request path within the default logger. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary log lines by manipulating HTTP requests.
