Package        : libwebp
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-25009 CVE-2018-25010 CVE-2018-25011 CVE-2018-25013
                 CVE-2018-25014 CVE-2020-36328 CVE-2020-36329 CVE-2020-36330
                 CVE-2020-36331 CVE-2020-36332

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libwebp, the implementation
of the WebP image format, which could result in denial of service, memory
disclosure or potentially the execution of arbitrary code if malformed
images are processed.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.1-2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libwebp packages.

For the detailed security status of libwebp please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libwebp>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
