Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-36332:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how `libwebp` handles file reading, specifically related to memory allocation. It does not properly limit the amount of memory allocated during file processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Excessive Memory Allocation:** The core issue is the excessive memory allocation in `libwebp` when reading a file, leading to a potential memory exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service. By providing a maliciously crafted file, an attacker can cause the affected application to allocate an excessive amount of memory, leading to resource exhaustion and service unavailability.
*   **Potential for Other Impacts:** While not explicitly stated, the Debian security advisory mentions the potential for memory disclosure or arbitrary code execution, in addition to DoS, from multiple vulnerabilities in `libwebp`, although CVE-2020-36332 is specifically linked to DoS via excessive memory allocation, implying that other vulnerabilities may be required to achieve these other impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Files:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted WebP image files that trigger the excessive memory allocation behavior when processed by `libwebp`.
*  **Network Attack Vector:** The vulnerability has a network attack vector, meaning it can be triggered remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Submit Files for Processing:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious WebP file to an application that uses the vulnerable version of `libwebp` for processing. This could be via a web service, email attachment or another file handling interface.
*   **No Privileges Required:** No special user privileges are required to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:**  Versions of `libwebp` before 1.0.1 are vulnerable.
*  **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.5 (HIGH), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. This indicates the impact is primarily to availability of service.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in `libwebp` version 1.0.1 and later.
* **Red Hat Specific:** Red Hat assigned the alias CVE-2020-36332 to the bug and classified it as a medium severity issue. They state that the highest threat is to service availability.
* **NetApp Specific:** NetApp indicates that the vulnerability can lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or DoS.

**Summary of extracted information:**

* Vulnerability: Excessive memory allocation when reading a file.
* Root Cause: Improper memory handling when processing malformed webp images.
* Weakness: Lack of limit on memory allocation during file parsing.
* Impact: Denial of service due to memory exhaustion.
* Attack Vector: Delivering maliciously crafted WebP files.
* Attacker Capabilities: Ability to provide file to vulnerable software.
* Affected version: libwebp versions before 1.0.1.
* Fix: libwebp 1.0.1
