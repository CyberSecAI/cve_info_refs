Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-36126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in the PAXSTORE marketplace APIs. The API endpoints allow authenticated users to access and manipulate data belonging to other users, applications, and payment terminals, without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **IDOR Vulnerability:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks when accessing resources via the API. The system uses predictable identifiers (sequential IDs, serial numbers) that can be easily guessed or enumerated by attackers.
- **Broken Access Control:** This is a classic case of broken access control, where users can access resources they are not supposed to.
- **Numerous Vulnerable Endpoints**: The advisory lists 26 different API endpoints vulnerable to IDOR attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation (Horizontal & Vertical):** Attackers can impersonate other users, including administrators, granting them unauthorized access and privileges within the platform.
- **Data Breaches:** Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including user data, application secrets, and device details, can occur.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data belonging to other users, applications, or terminals, leading to potential fraud, service disruptions, and operational failures.
- **Malware Deployment:** Attackers could force remote installation of malicious applications on thousands of payment terminals managed by PAXSTORE.
- **Botnet Creation:** Attackers could create a botnet of compromised payment terminals for DDoS attacks.
- **Financial Information Theft:** Attackers can target financial information from the terminals or the platform.
- **Terminal Disruption:** Attackers could put payment terminals out of operation.
- **Compromise of Signing Keys:** The document mentions that an attacker can also use another vulnerability to obtain signing keys that would allow them to further compromise terminals.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **API Manipulation:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious API requests with predictable identifiers to target specific users, applications, or terminals.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (developer, reseller, or terminal user) to exploit the IDOR vulnerabilities.
- **Knowledge of the API:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the PAXSTORE API structure and endpoints.
- **Enumeration:** Attackers can use techniques like enumeration to discover accessible resources by trying different predictable identifiers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid account on the PAXSTORE platform (e.g., a developer or reseller account).
- The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the PAXSTORE API endpoints and data structure.
- An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities through the use of standard web application testing tools that allow modifying request parameters.

**Summary**
The advisory details how a multitude of IDOR vulnerabilities in the PAXSTORE API could allow an attacker to take control of other accounts, deploy malicious applications, and disable terminals. The fact that these vulnerabilities could be exploited with standard web app testing tools makes this a high risk issue.
