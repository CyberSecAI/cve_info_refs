Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-36425:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in how Mbed TLS handles the `revocationDate` field within X.509 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).  Specifically, the code was checking if the revocation date was in the past, according to the local clock.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Revocation Date Check:** The primary weakness was that Mbed TLS was incorrectly using the `revocationDate` field for determining if a certificate was revoked. According to RFC 5280, this field is not a required validation check and is more informational.
*   **Dependency on Local Clock:** The check relied on the local system's clock. This made it vulnerable if the clock was incorrect or if an attacker had control over the local clock.
*   **No Revocation on Systems without Time:** On builds without `MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE`, certificates were never considered as revoked, because `mbedtls_x509_time_is_past` always returned 0, preventing any revocation check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Revocation:** An attacker controlling the local clock could potentially prevent certificates from being revoked, even if they were on a CRL. This could lead to the acceptance of compromised certificates. This is particularly concerning in secure enclave environments where an untrusted OS could tamper with the clock.
*   **No CRL Checking:** In systems compiled without time support, CRL checks were effectively disabled, which could lead to accepting revoked certificates, resulting in compromised connections.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access/Untrusted OS:** The primary attack vector was via a local attacker who could potentially manipulate the system's clock. This is a threat in environments like secure enclaves where an untrusted OS may be present.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to manipulate the system clock:** In systems with `MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE` defined, the attacker needs the capability to modify the system's time to bypass CRL checks.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access (or some form of control over the environment) to influence the system's clock or run the application without time support (no `MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE`).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by no longer checking the revocationDate field.
*   This vulnerability also existed in older versions of the library, and the fix was backported to versions 2.7 and 2.16
*   The vulnerability was reported by yuemonangong in issue #3340 and independently fixed by Raoul Strackx and Jethro Beekman in pull request #3433
