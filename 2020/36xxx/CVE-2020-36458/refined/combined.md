# ReaderResult should be bounded by Sync
Affected versions of this crate implements `Sync` for `ReaderResult` with the trait bound `T: Send, E: Send`.
Since matching on the public enum `ReaderResult` provides access to `&T` & `&E`,
allowing data race to a non-Sync type `T` or `E`.
This can result in a memory corruption when multiple threads concurrently access `&T` or `&E`.
Suggested fix for the bug is change the trait bounds imposed on `T` & `E` to be `T: Sync, E: Sync`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# ReaderResult should be bounded by Sync

Currently `ReaderResult` has the bounds:

```
unsafe impl<T, E> Sync for ReaderResult<T, E>
where
  T: Send,
  E: Send,
{
}
```

However, I think this should be `T: Sync` and `E: Sync`, otherwise there is a potential soundness issue with references to `ReaderResult`. These will get marked as `Sync` because `ReaderResult` is `Sync` but allow the underlying non-Sync types to be accessed. Here's a demonstration of sending `Cell` across threads using this:

```
use lexer::ReaderResult;

use std::cell::Cell;
use crossbeam_utils::thread;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum RefOrInt<'a> {
    Ref(&'a u64),
    Int(u64),
}
static SOME_INT: u64 = 123;

fn main() {
    let reader_result : ReaderResult<_, ()> = ReaderResult::Some(
        Cell::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT)));

    thread::scope(|s| {
        let reader_result_ref = &reader_result;
        s.spawn(move |_| {
            let sent_ref = reader_result_ref;
            if let ReaderResult::Some(smuggled_cell) = sent_ref {
                loop {
                    // Repeatedly write Ref(&addr) and Int(0xdeadbeef) into the cell.
                    smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
                    smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
                }
            }
        });

        if let ReaderResult::Some(cell) = reader_result_ref {
            loop {
                if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = cell.get() {
                    // Hope that between the time we pattern match the object as a
                    // `Ref`, it gets written to by the other thread.
                    if addr as *const u64 == &SOME_INT as *const u64 {
                        continue;
                    }

                    // Due to the data race, obtaining Ref(0xdeadbeef) is possible
                    println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
                    println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
                }
            }
        }
    });
}
```

This outputs:

```
Pointer is now: 0xdeadbeef

Return Code: -11 (SIGSEGV)
```
