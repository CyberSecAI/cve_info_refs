Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36458:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `lexer` crate incorrectly implemented the `Sync` trait for the `ReaderResult` enum. It used the trait bounds `T: Send, E: Send`, instead of `T: Sync, E: Sync`. This allowed non-thread-safe types `T` and `E` to be accessed concurrently from multiple threads, leading to data races.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect `Sync` implementation:** The core issue is the flawed implementation of the `Sync` trait for the `ReaderResult` enum, not enforcing `Sync` bounds on generic types `T` and `E`.
- **Data Race:** Concurrent access to shared mutable data without proper synchronization. The `ReaderResult` enum provided a way to access `&T` and `&E` which could lead to race conditions if `T` or `E` were not `Sync`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The data race can lead to memory corruption when multiple threads concurrently access the underlying data through the `&T` or `&E` references.
- **Segmentation Fault:** In the provided example, the data race leads to reading an invalid memory address and triggering a segmentation fault.
- **Unspecified Behavior:** More generally, the vulnerability can lead to undefined behavior, potentially including arbitrary code execution depending on the types used as `T` and `E`.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Multi-threaded code:** The vulnerability can be triggered by any code that uses the `lexer` crate's `ReaderResult` in a multi-threaded context and accesses the contained data concurrently.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to create multiple threads:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create and manage multiple threads to trigger the data race.
- **Knowledge of the `lexer` crate's API:** The attacker needs to know how to use the `ReaderResult` enum and its associated types.
- **No special privileges or user interaction is required**

**More Details than CVE description:**

The provided content gives much more detail than the placeholder CVE description. It provides the following information:

- Specific code example demonstrating the vulnerability, including a demonstration of a thread sending a `Cell` across threads to cause a segmentation fault
- Specific trait bounds used that caused the issue
- Correct fix which involves changing the trait bounds on `T` and `E` to require `Sync`
- The `Sync` trait is about whether a type can be shared between threads. The `Send` trait is about whether a type can be transferred to another thread.
- CVSS score and vector
- Links to the fix in the gitlab issue

In summary, CVE-2020-36458 is caused by an incorrect implementation of the `Sync` trait for the `ReaderResult` enum in the `lexer` crate, which allows for data races and memory corruption when used in multi-threaded programs. The fix involves requiring the generic types `T` and `E` to implement the `Sync` trait.
