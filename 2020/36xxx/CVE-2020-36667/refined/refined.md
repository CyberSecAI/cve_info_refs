Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36667:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in the JetBackup â€“ WP Backup, Migrate & Restore plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the `backup_guard_cloud_dropbox`, `backup_guard_cloud_gdrive`, and `backup_guard_cloud_oneDrive` functions do not properly verify user capabilities before allowing changes to backup locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the absence of sufficient capability checks. This allows users with low-level permissions (like subscribers) to access functionality intended for administrators or users with higher privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Backup Location Changes:** An attacker can modify where backups are stored. This could mean redirecting backups to attacker-controlled locations.
- **Potential Information Theft:** By changing the backup location, an attacker can gain access to sensitive data contained in backups.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's functions responsible for handling cloud storage configurations.
- The attack vector is via HTTP requests to `backup_guard_cloud_dropbox`, `backup_guard_cloud_gdrive`, and `backup_guard_cloud_oneDrive` functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site.
- **Low-Level Permissions:** The attacker only requires minimal permissions, such as those of a "subscriber".

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions of the JetBackup plugin up to and including 1.4.0.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.4.1.
- The vulnerability is classified as a "Missing Authorization" issue.
- The CVSS score is 5.4 (Medium).
- The researcher who identified the vulnerability is Chloe Chamberland from Wordfence.
