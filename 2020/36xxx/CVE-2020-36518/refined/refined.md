Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36518:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2020-36518 in multiple places, including:
   - The title of GitHub issue #2816: "Optimize `UntypedObjectDeserializer` wrt recursion [CVE-2020-36518]"
   - The description of the issue: "**EDIT**: related to to [CVE-2020-36518](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-57j2-w4cx-62h2 "CVE-2020-36518") (see <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36518>)"
   - NetApp's advisory: "CVE-2020-36518 FasterXML Jackson Databind Vulnerability in NetApp Products"
   - Debian security advisory: "CVE ID : CVE-2020-36518"
   - GitHub Advisory Database entry for GHSA-57j2-w4cx-62h2 which is linked to CVE-2020-36518.

Therefore, the content is highly relevant to CVE-2020-36518.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the recursive nature of the `UntypedObjectDeserializer` in FasterXML Jackson Databind when handling deeply nested JSON objects and arrays. This recursion can lead to stack exhaustion.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Unbounded Recursion:** The `UntypedObjectDeserializer` uses recursion to handle nested structures. This recursion is unbounded and can lead to a stack overflow error if the nesting depth is too great.
   - **Inefficient Deserialization:** The recursive implementation is considered "relatively expensive" for deeply nested objects and arrays, even without custom deserializers.
   - **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** There's an absence of checks to limit the level of nesting in input JSON documents, which enables the attack vector.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of successful exploitation is:
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft a specially designed, deeply nested JSON document that will trigger a stack overflow and crash the application using Jackson Databind.
    - **Resource Exhaustion:** The excessive recursion can also lead to JVM memory exhaustion

**5. Attack Vectors:**

The primary attack vector is by providing a malicious, deeply nested JSON document to a vulnerable application that utilizes the `UntypedObjectDeserializer` for deserialization.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker needs:
  - **Ability to Provide Arbitrary JSON:** The attacker must be able to supply the vulnerable application with a crafted JSON document. This could occur through various means, such as API calls, data uploads, configuration files, etc.
  - **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without needing to be authenticated. This means that it can be exploited from any position.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects cases where the target type for deserialization is untyped (e.g., `Object`, `Collection<Object>`, `Map<String, Object>`), which implies that it's not an issue when dealing with POJOs except if those POJOs contain "untyped" properties.
*   The issue has been addressed by replacing recursion with iteration or a similar approach.
*   There is also mention of the need for adding limits on the size and/or complexity of the input to prevent DoS attacks through extremely large files.
*   Patches for this issue are included in Jackson Databind versions 2.12.6.1, 2.13.2.1, 2.13.2.2, 2.13.3 and 2.14.0, as well as specific NetApp products.
*  The issue was also identified as one of the "top-10 vulns of 2022" by Snyk.

In summary, CVE-2020-36518 represents a DoS vulnerability within the `UntypedObjectDeserializer` of FasterXML Jackson Databind, arising from unbounded recursion when processing deeply nested JSON data. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by supplying a specially crafted JSON document, leading to a stack overflow and application crash.
