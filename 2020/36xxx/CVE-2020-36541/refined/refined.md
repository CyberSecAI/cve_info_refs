Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities found in the Demokratian application:

**Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The `genera_select.php` script uses user-supplied input (`id_provincia` parameter) in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   SQL Injection vulnerability in the `id_provincia` GET parameter.
    *   The `fn_filtro` function was insufficient to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
    *   Sensitive data, including voter information, can be extracted from the database.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is exploitable through an HTTP GET request.
    *   The attacker can inject malicious SQL code within the `id_provincia` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates a union-based SQL injection to retrieve the database name.
    *   The fix involves using the `fn_filtro_numerico` function, which appears to properly handle numeric input.

**Vulnerability 2: Broken Authentication**

*   **Root Cause:** The `install/install3.php` installation script is not removed after installation.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Insecure default configurations that leave the installation script accessible.
    *   Lack of access controls for `install/install3.php`
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can create an administrator user, gaining full control of the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is exploitable through an HTTP GET request.
    *   The attacker can access the `install3.php` file directly via the web.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
* **Additional Details:**
   * The fix is to delete the `install/install3.php` script after the installation process.
