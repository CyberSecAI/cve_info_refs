| The CVE description says:  In the standard library in Rust before 1.50.3  I'm not sure I'm following it correctly but it doesn't seem correct for me. It should be "before 1.52.0" if we backport this to beta? |

| The CVE description says:  In the standard library in Rust before 1.50.3  I'm not sure I'm following it correctly but it doesn't seem correct for me. It should be "before 1.52.0" if we backport this to beta? |

| The CVE description says:  In the standard library in Rust before 1.50.3  I'm not sure I'm following it correctly but it doesn't seem correct for me. It should be "before 1.52.0" if we backport this to beta? |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1950396#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-04-16 14:15:23 UTC  ``` In the standard library in Rust before 1.53.0, there is an optimization for joining strings that can cause uninitialized bytes to be exposed (or the program to crash) if the borrowed string changes after its length is checked.  Reference: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80335>  Upstream patch: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81728>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1950396#c1)  Josh Stone    2021-04-16 17:33:08 UTC  ``` (In reply to Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1950396#c0)) > In the standard library in Rust before 1.50.3,  They made a typo in the CVE -- there's no such release 1.50.3, but the referenced pull request will be released in 1.53.0. It could also get backported to beta in time for 1.52.0.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1950396#c2)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-04-16 17:42:32 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1950396#c1): > (In reply to Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1950396#c0)) > > In the standard library in Rust before 1.50.3, >  > They made a typo in the CVE -- there's no such release 1.50.3, but the > referenced pull request will be released in 1.53.0. It could also get > backported to beta in time for 1.52.0.  Thanks for the heads up! I have updated the [comment#0](show_bug.cgi?id=1950396#c0) with the right affected version and also created tracker bugs for Fedora and EPEL.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1950396#c3)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-04-16 17:42:55 UTC  ``` Created rust tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1950486](show_bug.cgi?id=1950486 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-36323 rust: optimization for joining strings can cause uninitialized bytes to be exposed [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1950485](show_bug.cgi?id=1950485 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-36323 rust: optimization for joining strings can cause uninitialized bytes to be exposed [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1950396#c7)  Josh Stone    2021-04-29 16:18:43 UTC  ``` This was backported to the upstream beta branch, so it will now be fixed in 1.52.0. <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84603>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1950396#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-08-10 07:26:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Developer Tools  Via RHSA-2021:3042 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3042](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A3042)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1950396#c10)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-08-10 13:28:39 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1949211#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-04-13 17:37:48 UTC  ``` In the standard library in Rust before 1.52.0, the Zip implementation can report an incorrect size due to an integer overflow.

## Description

![@Qwaz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5073807?u=2ce3c5e94d4fa1db409878d8812e2dfe6cb164bf&v=4&size=48)[Qwaz](https://github.com/Qwaz)opened [on Dec 23, 2020](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/80335#issue-773925837)

A weird `Borrow` implementation that returns a different result for each call can create a string with uninitialized bytes with [join()](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#impl-Join%3C%26%27_%20str%3E) implementation of `[Borrow<str>]` type.

The problem is in [`join_generic_copy`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3ffea60dd5a2260004cc4f487401ae7c7db1aa0e/library/alloc/src/str.rs#L137) function.

1. The borrow result is first used for the length calculation.

   [rust/library/alloc/src/str.rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3ffea60dd5a2260004cc4f487401ae7c7db1aa0e/library/alloc/src/str.rs#L152-L161)

   Lines 152 to 161
   in
   [3ffea60](/rust-lang/rust/commit/3ffea60dd5a2260004cc4f487401ae7c7db1aa0e)

   |  | // compute the exact total length of the joined Vec |
   | --- | --- |
   |  | // if the `len` calculation overflows, we'll panic |
   |  | // we would have run out of memory anyway and the rest of the function requires |
   |  | // the entire Vec pre-allocated for safety |
   |  | let len = sep\_len |
   |  | .checked\_mul(iter.len()) |
   |  | .and\_then(|n| { |
   |  | slice.iter().map(|s| s.borrow().as\_ref().len()).try\_fold(n, usize::checked\_add) |
   |  | }) |
   |  | .expect("attempt to join into collection with len > usize::MAX"); |
2. Then, inside `spezialize_for_lengths` macro, the user-provided slice is borrowed again and the content is copied.

   [rust/library/alloc/src/str.rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3ffea60dd5a2260004cc4f487401ae7c7db1aa0e/library/alloc/src/str.rs#L110-L114)

   Lines 110 to 114
   in
   [3ffea60](/rust-lang/rust/commit/3ffea60dd5a2260004cc4f487401ae7c7db1aa0e)

   |  | // arbitrary non-zero size fallback |
   | --- | --- |
   |  | for s in iter { |
   |  | copy\_slice\_and\_advance!(target, sep\_bytes); |
   |  | copy\_slice\_and\_advance!(target, s.borrow().as\_ref()); |
   |  | } |
3. Finally, the length of the slice is set to the length calculated in step 1.

   [rust/library/alloc/src/str.rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3ffea60dd5a2260004cc4f487401ae7c7db1aa0e/library/alloc/src/str.rs#L179)

   [3ffea60](/rust-lang/rust/commit/3ffea60dd5a2260004cc4f487401ae7c7db1aa0e)

   |  | result.set\_len(len); |
   | --- | --- |

[Playground link](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=7432c762775696504c2fb19439fc091a), which demonstrates creating a non-UTF-8 string by only using safe Rust.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
