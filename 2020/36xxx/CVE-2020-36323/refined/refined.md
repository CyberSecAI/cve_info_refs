{
  "CVE-2020-36323": {
    "Description": "In the standard library in Rust before 1.53.0, there is an optimization for joining strings that can cause uninitialized bytes to be exposed (or the program to crash) if the borrowed string changes after its length is checked.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. The `join` function calculates the required buffer size based on the length of the borrowed strings, but it borrows the string data again later to perform the copy. If a borrowed string changes its length between these two steps, the copy can read out-of-bounds data, potentially exposing uninitialized bytes or causing a crash. The `join_generic_copy` function uses the borrow result for length calculation then borrows again for copying. The length of the slice is set to the length calculated from first borrow result.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "TOCTOU race condition",
      "Use of potentially changing borrowed data",
        "Improper handling of borrowed data's lifetime"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exposing uninitialized bytes or program crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation can be achieved by modifying the borrowed string after its length is initially checked but before the copy operation is done.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to modify the borrowed string concurrently while it's being used within the `join` function."
