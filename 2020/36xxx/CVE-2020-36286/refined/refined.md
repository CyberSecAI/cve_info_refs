- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `membersOf` JQL search function in Jira Server and Data Center allows remote anonymous attackers to determine if a group exists and the members of those groups. This is achieved if the groups are assigned to a publicly visible issue field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Disclosure. The `membersOf` JQL function reveals group existence and membership to unauthorized users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote, anonymous attackers can enumerate groups and group members by querying publicly visible issue fields.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs via crafted JQL queries using the vulnerable `membersOf` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send JQL queries to the Jira instance and have no prior authentication is required (anonymous attacker). The groups need to be assigned to a publicly visible issue field.
