Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of table names used in SQL queries. Specifically, the application was directly using user-provided table names in the `SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM` and `SHOW INDEX FROM` SQL queries without proper escaping or quoting, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application was vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly concatenated user-controlled input (table name) into SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify data, or even compromise the entire database server by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `LoadTable` function, where a malicious table name is passed as a parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to influence the table name parameter used in the `LoadTable` function or any other area where the table name is used in a SQL query. This could be achieved through a vulnerable API endpoint or other input mechanism.
- No specific user privileges are mentioned in the provided context.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was located in the `table.go` file, where the `loadColumns` and `loadKeys` functions were constructing SQL queries using string concatenation with the table name.
- The fix involved escaping backticks within the table name and enclosing the table name in backticks before using it in SQL queries. The `quoteNameStr` function was introduced to handle this escaping.
- The `ast.go` file was modified to define constants for backticks and implement a `quoteName` function for quoting column names (similar to what was done for table names), though the primary fix focused on the table name.
- New tests were added in `table_test.go` to specifically test for the SQL injection vulnerability using malicious table names like `"objects WHERE false"` and `"foo`;bar"`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The pull request #76, titled "Prevent a SQL injection", addresses this vulnerability.
- The commit `f6f0a47` contains the fix for the vulnerability.
- The fix involves enclosing table names in backticks and escaping inner backticks within table names before using them in SQL queries.
- The fix also included a new test case to check for SQL injection vulnerabilities related to table names.
- A comment by `bwester` suggests that the fix might need to be applied to other identifiers as well, which was not included as a part of this fix.
- The Go vulnerability database mentions this vulnerability as CVE-2020-36645 in `golang/vulndb#1295`.
