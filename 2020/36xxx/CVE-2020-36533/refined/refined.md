This content does not relate to CVE-2020-36533. It describes multiple vulnerabilities found in the Klapp application, but does not reference or relate to a specific CVE.
The identified vulnerabilities include:

- **Authorization code leakage:** Authorization codes for parents were exposed in server responses, allowing any recipient to impersonate another user.
  - **Root cause:**  Lack of proper access control and data handling on the server-side.
  - **Weaknesses:**  Information disclosure, privilege escalation.
  - **Impact:**  Impersonation, social engineering attacks.
  - **Attack vectors:**  Network interception, malicious app code.
  - **Attacker capabilities:**  Basic network access or code injection.
- **Persistent JWT tokens:**  JSON Web Tokens used for authentication lacked an expiration time, allowing indefinite access.
  - **Root cause:** Improper implementation of JWT.
  - **Weaknesses:** Session hijacking, long-term unauthorized access.
  - **Impact:** Account takeover.
  - **Attack vectors:** Token theft from device or backups.
  - **Attacker capabilities:**  Access to the device, backups or network traffic.
- **Unencrypted local data:**  Sensitive data was stored unencrypted in a local SQLite database on the device and backups.
  - **Root cause:** Lack of encryption for sensitive local data.
  - **Weaknesses:** Information disclosure, data breach.
  - **Impact:**  Sensitive data exposure.
  - **Attack vectors:** Device compromise, backup compromise.
  - **Attacker capabilities:** Physical device access or backup access.
- **Message sending to unauthorized recipients:**  It was possible to send messages to other parents by manipulating the recipient user ID, which was intended for teacher communication.
  - **Root cause:**  Lack of proper input validation and role-based access control in the backend.
  - **Weaknesses:**  Bypass of intended message restrictions, information disclosure.
  - **Impact:**  Privacy violation, unauthorized communication.
  - **Attack vectors:**  Direct interaction with the API by changing the user id parameter.
  - **Attacker capabilities:**  User account and application access.
- **Push notification and email content leakage to third-party services**: Push notifications and emails were sent using third-party services (OneSignal and Mailgun) which could potentially expose message content and metadata to these third parties.
  - **Root cause**: Use of external third party services without considering privacy implications.
  - **Weaknesses**: Information disclosure, lack of control over data.
  - **Impact**: Potential data leakage to untrusted third parties.
  - **Attack vectors**: Network traffic interception, third party services data compromise.
  - **Attacker capabilities**: Access to third-party service's infrastructure or network traffic interception.
- **Lack of certificate pinning:** The app did not implement certificate pinning, leaving it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    - **Root cause**: Lack of certificate pinning implementation.
    - **Weaknesses**: Vulnerable to MITM attacks, data interception.
    - **Impact**: Data exfiltration, privacy violation.
    - **Attack vectors**: MITM attacks
    - **Attacker capabilities**: Interception of network traffic.
- **Lack of jailbreak detection:** The app does not check for the jailbreak status of the device
    - **Root cause**: Lack of jailbreak detection implementation.
    - **Weaknesses**: Data theft on compromised devices.
    - **Impact**: Data exfiltration, privacy violation.
    - **Attack vectors**: Compromised devices.
    - **Attacker capabilities**: Access to jailbroken devices
- **Lack of app-level security measures:** The app lacks additional security measures such as a passcode or biometric authentication to restrict access.
    - **Root cause**: Lack of implementation of app security measures.
    - **Weaknesses**: Data exfiltration, privacy violation.
    - **Impact**: Data exfiltration, unauthorized access.
    - **Attack vectors**: Direct device access.
    - **Attacker capabilities**: Physical device access.
