Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36461:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `MvccRwLock` implementation in the `noise_search` crate unconditionally implementing `Send` and `Sync` traits. This allows the use of non-thread-safe types within the lock, leading to data races and aliasing issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Data Races:** The unconditional implementation of `Send` and `Sync` for `MvccRwLock` allows types that are not thread-safe (e.g., `Rc<T>`, `Arc<Cell<_>>`) to be used within the lock and sent across thread boundaries, resulting in data races.
2.  **Aliasing Violations:** Safe APIs of `MvccRwLock` allow the simultaneous existence of `&T` and `LockResult<MutexGuard<Box<T>>>` in conflicting lifetime regions, leading to aliasing violations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Data races can potentially lead to memory corruption, as demonstrated by the provided proof-of-concept (PoC).
*   **Undefined Behavior:** The aliasing violations can cause undefined behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The CVSS vector indicates the attack vector is network-based `AV:N`.
*   **Thread Boundary Crossing:** The vulnerability is triggered when non-thread-safe types inside `MvccRwLock` are sent across thread boundaries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges `PR:N`.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability is triggered without any user interaction `UI:N`.
*   **High Attack Complexity:** The vulnerability has a high attack complexity `AC:H`.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send data across threads.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was reported on December 10, 2020, and the advisory was issued on February 1, 2021.
*   No patched versions of the crate are available.
*   The vulnerability is classified under memory corruption and thread-safety categories.
*   The CVSS score is 8.1 (HIGH).
* The fix requires marking the APIs of `MvccRwLock` as `unsafe` or changing `MbccRwLock` to private or pub(crate).
