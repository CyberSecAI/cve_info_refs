### Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `MvccRwLock`.
This can lead to data races when types that are either `!Send` or `!Sync` (e.g. `Rc<T>`, `Arc<Cell<_>>`) are contained inside `MvccRwLock` and sent across thread boundaries. The data races can potentially lead to memory corruption (as demonstrated in the PoC from the original report issue).

Also, safe APIs of `MvccRwLock` allow aliasing violations by allowing `&T` and `LockResult<MutexGuard<Box<T>>>` to co-exist in conflicting lifetime regions. The APIs of `MvccRwLock` should either be marked as `unsafe` or `MbccRwLock` should be changed to private or pub(crate).

## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Dec 10, 2020](https://github.com/pipedown/noise/issues/72#issue-760951462)

Hi there, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are scanning crates on crates.io for potential soundness bugs. We noticed that `MvccRwLock` implements Send and Sync for all types:

[noise/src/index.rs](https://github.com/pipedown/noise/blob/5a582a7d0af1d7038646bfacaced40c3c19d4421/src/index.rs#L418-L419)

Lines 418 to 419
in
[5a582a7](/pipedown/noise/commit/5a582a7d0af1d7038646bfacaced40c3c19d4421)

|  | unsafe impl<T> Send for MvccRwLock<T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<T> Sync for MvccRwLock<T> {} |

However, this should probably have tighter bounds on its `Send` and `Sync` traits, otherwise its possible to create data-races from safe rust code by using non-Sync types like `Cell` across threads or sending non-Send types across like `Rc`. Here's a little proof-of-concept using `Rc`.

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use noise_search::index::MvccRwLock;

use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let rc = Rc::new(42);

    let lock = MvccRwLock::new(rc.clone());
    std::thread::spawn(move || {
        let smuggled_rc = lock.read();

        println!("Thread: {:p}", *smuggled_rc);
        for _ in 0..100_000_000 {
            (*smuggled_rc).clone();
        }
    });

    println!("Main:   {:p}", rc);
    for _ in 0..100_000_000 {
        rc.clone();
    }
}
```

This outputs:

```
Main:   0x561539bdcd40
Thread: 0x561539bdcd40

Terminated with signal 4 (SIGILL)

```

It seems like this class also potentially allows for aliasing violations, in this case maybe it would be better to mark the methods as unsafe and maybe not expose the class outside the crate?
