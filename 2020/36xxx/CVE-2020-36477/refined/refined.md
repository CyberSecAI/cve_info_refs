Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36477:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper comparison of the expected common name (CN) against the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension in X.509 certificates. Specifically, the `mbedtls_x509_crt_verify()` function compares the expected name with *any* name present in the SAN extension, without regard to the name type. This means a hostname, for instance, could be incorrectly matched against an IP address present in the SAN.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect SAN Handling:** The core issue is the failure to distinguish between different types of SAN entries. The function treats all SANs the same leading to misidentification.
- **Type Confusion:** By not validating the type of SAN entry, the system can be tricked into considering IP addresses as valid hostnames, allowing for a bypass of intended security checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Certificate Spoofing/Impersonation:** An attacker could potentially impersonate a legitimate domain by obtaining a certificate that includes a matching IP address in its SAN extension. This requires that the attacker controls the IP address.
- **Bypassed Verification:** The incorrect matching logic would result in a successful certificate verification despite a mismatch between the requested hostname/domain and the actual certificate's subject.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker could present a fraudulent certificate with a crafted SAN to a vulnerable client, which would incorrectly validate it, potentially allowing them to intercept or modify communications.
- **Compromised Certificate Authority (CA):** If an attacker can influence a CA to issue certificates with malicious IP address SAN entries, they could leverage that to impersonate domains.
- **Local Attacks:** In some configurations, if an attacker can obtain a certificate that includes a matching IP address in its SAN, they could launch a local attack by presenting the fraudulent certificate to a vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Certificate Acquisition:** The attacker must obtain a certificate where a SAN value is crafted to cause the vulnerability.
- **Controlled IP Address (for IP Address SAN exploitation):** To exploit the IP address matching flaw, the attacker needs to control the IP address specified in the certificate's SAN extension. This usually means controlling a server at that IP.
- **Network Position:** For MITM attacks, the attacker needs to be in a network position to intercept traffic between the vulnerable client and server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of mbed TLS that support SAN extensions, including v2.16.4 and git-8f4f9a8da.
- The issue was reported by kFYatek in issue #3498 of the mbedtls GitHub repository.
- The vulnerability was fixed in mbed TLS version 2.24.0 by ensuring that IP address SANs are handled correctly.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 202301-08 lists this vulnerability and recommends updating to mbedtls-2.28.1 or later to mitigate.

**Summary of CVE-2020-36477:**
This CVE describes a vulnerability in mbed TLS where the library incorrectly validates X.509 certificates by comparing the expected name against any name in the subjectAltName (SAN) extension, regardless of its type. This allows an attacker to potentially impersonate a domain by obtaining a certificate with a matching IP address in the SAN. The issue is resolved in newer versions by properly handling different types of SANs.
