Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `LockWeak<T>` struct in the `parc` crate incorrectly implemented the `Send` trait without requiring the underlying type `T` to be `Sync`. `LockWeak<T>` only provides a shared reference (`&T`) to the data it holds but does not own the data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unconditional `Send` Implementation:** The `Send` trait was implemented for `LockWeak<T>` regardless of whether `T` was thread-safe (i.e., implemented the `Sync` trait).
- **Data Race Potential:** This allowed multiple threads to concurrently access a non-`Sync` type `T`, leading to data races.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Undefined Behavior:** Data races can lead to undefined behavior, including memory corruption, program crashes, and unexpected results.
- **Memory Leaks:** The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates that the program can panic due to a memory leak (when the strong count of the `Rc` is greater than 1).
- **Illegal Instructions:** The program can crash with an "Illegal Instruction" error, as shown in the example when run on Ubuntu 18.04.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Concurrent Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by creating a `LockWeak` instance holding a non-`Sync` type, and then accessing it concurrently from multiple threads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to write Rust code that uses the `parc` crate.
- No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, as it stems from the flawed implementation of the `Send` trait.
- The vulnerability can be triggered from any location (network) where the vulnerable code is executed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed by adding a `Sync` bound to the `Send` implementation of `LockWeak<T>`.
- The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited using safe Rust code, highlighting a soundness issue in the library.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-36454 and GHSA-29v7-3v4c-gf38. It is also tracked under RUSTSEC-2020-0134 and GHSA-xwxc-j97j-84gf
