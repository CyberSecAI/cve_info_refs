The provided content relates to CVE-2020-36633.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Moodle block_sitenews plugin was missing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating the number of news items to display.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: The plugin allowed the number of news items to be updated via a POST request without verifying the origin, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially trick a logged-in user into unknowingly changing the number of news items displayed in the block, disrupting the user experience.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious webpage containing a form that, when submitted by a logged-in user, would send a POST request to update the news items number, without the user's knowledge.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user into accessing a malicious webpage or link that triggers the crafted POST request.
