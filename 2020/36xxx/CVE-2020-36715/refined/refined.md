Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36715:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check and lack of security nonce in the "Login/Signup Popup" plugin (also known as "Easy Login for Woocommerce") for WordPress. Specifically, the plugin failed to verify if the user had the necessary permissions (manage_options capability) before allowing them to save settings via AJAX requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The `wp_ajax_xoo_aff_save_settings` and `wp_ajax_xoo_aff_reset_settings` actions were not properly restricted to users with the `manage_options` capability in versions prior to 1.5.
*   **Lack of Security Nonce:** The plugin didn't utilize security nonces for AJAX actions.
*   **Arbitrary Script Injection**: Missing sanitization of the plugin settings allows for arbitrary javascript injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An authenticated attacker (even with low privileges like a subscriber role) could exploit this vulnerability to:
*   Inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the plugin settings.
*   This injected code could then execute in the context of an administrator's browser when they interact with the plugin's backend, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through AJAX requests to the WordPress backend (`wp_ajax_xoo_aff_save_settings` and `wp_ajax_xoo_aff_reset_settings`).
*   An attacker would need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
*   Social engineering to trick an administrator to perform a specific action after the malicious script was injected can be used to cause the malicious script to execute in the context of the administrator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site, and be authenticated.
*   The attacker does not need to be an administrator.
*   The attacker needs to craft AJAX requests to modify the plugin settings with malicious JavaScript code.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jerome Bruandet of NinTechNet.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.5 of the plugin, released on May 14, 2020.
*   The fix involved adding a `current_user_can( 'manage_options' )` check before registering the AJAX actions in `class-xoo-aff-fields.php`, securing them so only administrators can access them.
