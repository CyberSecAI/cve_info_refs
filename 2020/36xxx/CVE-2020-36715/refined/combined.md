### Description

The Login/Signup Popup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on several functions in versions up to, and including, 1.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into the plugin settings that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

# Zero-day vulnerability fixed in WordPress Login/Signup Popup plugin.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [May 15, 2020 - 1:38am [+0700]January 21, 2021 - 6:24pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/zero-day-vulnerability-fixed-in-wordpress-login-signup-popup-plugin/)

The WordPress [Login/Signup Popup](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-login-woocommerce/) plugin, which has 10,000+ active installations, fixed a zero-day vulnerability affecting version 1.4 and below.

A lack of capability checks and security nonce allows any authenticated user to inject, via the AJAX API, JavaScript code into the plugin’s settings and to use it to target the administrator in the backend of WordPress. The vulnerability has been exploited for a couple of days.

### Timeline

The vulnerability was reported on May 14th, 2020 to the author who immediately released a quick fix (version 1.5).

### Recommendations

**Upgrade immediately if you have version 1.4 or below.**

If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.
