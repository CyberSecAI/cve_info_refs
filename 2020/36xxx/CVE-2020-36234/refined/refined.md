The content is related to CVE-2020-36234.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when rendering the Screens Modal view in Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to stored XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit can allow a remote attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into the Screens Modal view. This can lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Defacement of the UI
- Phishing attempts
- Unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through custom fields in the Screens Modal view.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious code in the custom fields of the Screens Modal view. This could require the attacker to have some level of access or permissions within the Jira instance to modify the settings that would be presented in the Screens Modal.
