CVE-2020-36164: Veritas Enterprise Vault vulnerable to arbitrary code execution

- Root cause: Veritas Enterprise Vault loads the OpenSSL library on startup, which then attempts to load the openssl.cnf configuration file from specific locations. The vulnerability arises because a low-privileged user can create directories and a malicious openssl.cnf configuration file at these locations, leading to arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service starts.
- Weakness: Uncontrolled search path, insecure file permissions
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution with administrator privileges (SYSTEM), allowing the attacker to access all data and installed applications.
- Attack vector: Local
- Required attacker capabilities: A low-privileged user on the Windows system without specific Enterprise Vault privileges needs to be able to create directories under C:\.
