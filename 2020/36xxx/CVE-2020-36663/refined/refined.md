The provided content is related to CVE-2020-36663.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an open redirect issue in the `artesaos/seotools` repository. The code was not properly sanitizing user-provided URLs in the `OpenGraph`, `TwitterCards`, and `SEOMeta` components, specifically when setting the title or other metadata properties.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Open Redirect: The application was vulnerable to open redirect attacks due to the lack of sanitization of URL-related values within metadata tags. Specifically, the `http-equiv` and `url` parameters could be manipulated to redirect users to arbitrary locations.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The application lacked proper input validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious URLs into the metadata.
- Lack of Sanitization:  The `OpenGraph`, `TwitterCards`, and `SEOMeta` components were not properly sanitizing user-provided URLs, allowing for the injection of potentially malicious content and redirect attempts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Redirect to Malicious Sites: Attackers could redirect users to phishing pages or other malicious websites by manipulating the OpenGraph, TwitterCards, or meta tags.
- Potential for Phishing and Malware: Exploiting the open redirect could lead to phishing attacks or the distribution of malware.
- Reputational Damage:  The website could suffer reputational damage if users are redirected to malicious content.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious URL Injection: Attackers can inject malicious URLs into the metadata fields (e.g., title, description) that are used in the OpenGraph, TwitterCards, and meta tags.
- Manipulated Parameters: Attackers can manipulate the `http-equiv` and `url` parameters to cause the redirect.
- Specifically, the vulnerability existed within the `makeTag` method in `OpenGraph.php` and `TwitterCards.php` as well as the `setTitle` function in `SEOMeta.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious URLs into the application. This would typically be through user-provided input that is then rendered in the meta tags of the webpage.
- An attacker needs to find a way to manipulate data that is eventually placed in the title or other meta information that are used in the OpenGraph, TwitterCards, or SEOMeta tags.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involved stripping `http-equiv=` and `url=` from values before they are placed in the meta tags.
- The vulnerability was addressed in commit `ca27cd0edf917e0bc805227013859b8b5a1f01fb` and was released in version `v0.17.2`.
- The fix applies to the `OpenGraph.php`, `SEOMeta.php`, and `TwitterCards.php` files.
