Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36727:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the insecure deserialization of user-supplied data within the "Newsletter Manager" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin's `subscription.php` script deserializes the `customFieldsDetails` parameter using the `unserialize` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The core vulnerability is the use of PHP's `unserialize` function on user-provided input without any prior validation or sanitization.
- **PHP Object Injection:** This allows an attacker to inject serialized PHP objects which can be used to execute arbitrary code if a suitable "gadget chain" is present in the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the WordPress site.
- **Full System Compromise:** This can allow the attacker to gain complete control of the web server and the underlying operating system if other exploits are chained.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users, making it easier to target.
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker can inject a malicious serialized PHP object into the `customFieldsDetails` parameter via a standard HTTP request when submitting the subscription form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have any user account or privileges on the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of PHP:** The attacker needs to understand how PHP object injection and deserialization vulnerabilities work.

**Additional details:**
- The plugin was removed from the WordPress plugin repository due to this vulnerability and was never patched.
- A proof-of-concept was publicly available by the researcher, Jerome Bruandet (nintechnet)
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data).
- CVSS score of 7.7 (High) on wpscan and 9.8 (Critical) on Wordfence
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.5.1.
