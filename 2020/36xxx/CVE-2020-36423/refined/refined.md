Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36423:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Lucky 13 counter-measure within the mbedtls library. This counter-measure could become ineffective when hardware accelerators were used, specifically when employing `MBEDTLS_SHAxxx_ALT` macros.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Ineffective Lucky 13 Countermeasure:** The primary vulnerability is that the Lucky 13 counter-measure, designed to prevent timing attacks on CBC-mode ciphers in TLS, does not function correctly when hardware acceleration is used for SHA hash functions. This occurs due to improper handling of the `MBEDTLS_SHAxxx_ALT` macros.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Plaintext Recovery:** If the countermeasure is ineffective, an active network attacker can recover plaintext by performing repeated timing measurements. This is the original "Lucky 13" attack which the countermeasure was meant to mitigate.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** An attacker must be an active participant in a network connection.
*   **Timing Analysis:** The attacker must perform repeated timing measurements of the TLS handshake to recover the plaintext.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** The system under attack must be using hardware acceleration for SHA functions through `MBEDTLS_SHAxxx_ALT` macros.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Active Network Attacker:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify network traffic.
*   **Timing Measurement Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to measure network latencies and perform timing analysis.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is described as a failure of a countermeasure, rather than a vulnerability in core cryptographic primitives.
* The issue is related to the use of hardware acceleration for specific SHA algorithms.
* The successful exploitation of this vulnerability depends on specific configurations and conditions, i.e., hardware acceleration is enabled.
* The vulnerability is fixed in mbedtls versions 2.16.7 and 2.23.0 (as mentioned in the provided documents).
