The content is related to CVE-2020-36655.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient filtering of user-supplied input in the `generateString` function within `yiisoft/yii2-gii/src/Generator.php`. Specifically, the `$this->messageCategory` parameter is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code into generated model files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability through unsanitized user input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary PHP code execution on the server.
- Full compromise of the application
- Potential data breaches, system compromise, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker with access to the `/gii/` endpoint of the application.
- The attacker manipulates the `Message Category` field in the Model Generator of the Gii module.
- The injected code is placed into a generated model file.
- This code is then executed by using the generated model in the Form Generator.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the Gii module's interface, typically located at `/gii/` or similar paths, often available in development or staging environments
- Knowledge of an existing database and table within the application's scope.
