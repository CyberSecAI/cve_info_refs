The provided content describes multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in CMS Made Simple version 2.2.14.

**Root Cause:** The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in various features of the CMS. The application fails to properly encode or escape user input before rendering it in the web page, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored XSS: The majority of the vulnerabilities are stored XSS, where the malicious script is stored in the database and executed when the affected page is rendered. This happens in:
  - "Manage Shortcuts" feature.
  - "Categories" via "Settings - New Module".
  - "Options" via "Settings - New Module".
  - "Content Editing Settings" via "Settings - Global Settings".
  - "Admin Search" via "Extensions".
  - "Maintenance Mode" via "Settings - Global Settings".
  - "News" via "Content" feature (in the Extra field).
- Reflected XSS: Two instances are reflected XSS, where the malicious script is injected and executed immediately:
  -  "Design Manager" via "Layout" (when creating a new stylesheet).
  -  "Design Manager" via "Layout" (when creating a new design).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to:
  - Stealing cookies and session information.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.
  - Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vectors are the various input fields in the CMS admin interface, specifically:
  - "Title" in the "Manage Shortcuts" feature.
  - "Name" or "Parent" in the "Categories" feature.
  - "Email address to receive notification of news submission:" or "The Subject of the outgoing email:" in the "Options" feature.
  - "Path for the {page_image} tag:", "Path for thumbnail field:", or "Path for {content_image} tag:" in "Content Editing Settings".
  - "Search Text" in "Admin Search".
  - "Exclude these IP addresses from the "Site Down" status" in "Maintenance Mode".
   - "URL (slug)" or "Extra" in "News" feature (only "Extra" is fixed).
  - "*Name" when creating a new stylesheet or design in "Design Manager".
- An attacker needs to be authenticated to access the admin panel and exploit the stored XSS vulnerabilities. The reflected XSS could be exploited by enticing a logged-in administrator to click a crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the CMS admin panel.
- For the reflected XSS vulnerabilities, the attacker needs the ability to trick an admin into clicking a crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**
- Some of the issues, like the URL slug field, were not considered fixable, and others were deemed only exploitable by the submitting user.
- CMS Made Simple version 2.2.15 was released with fixes for some of these vulnerabilities.
