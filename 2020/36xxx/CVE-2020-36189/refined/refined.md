Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-36189:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way FasterXML jackson-databind handles polymorphic type handling. Specifically, it mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing. This means that when deserializing JSON data, Jackson can be tricked into instantiating and initializing classes that have malicious side effects if the application uses polymorphic typing with `java.lang.Object` or similar "permissive" types.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is that Jackson, when configured to handle polymorphic types, can deserialize data into arbitrary classes.  If an attacker can control the class name during deserialization, they can trigger the creation of a "gadget" class, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*  **Type Handling:**  Specifically, the vulnerability occurs if polymorphic type handling is enabled for properties with a nominal type of `java.lang.Object` or other "permissive" tag interfaces like `java.util.Serializable`, `java.util.Comparable`. This allows an attacker to specify any class for deserialization, as long as it implements the specified base type (e.g., `Object`).
* **"Gadget" Classes**: The vulnerability relies on "gadget" classes (like `com.newrelic.agent.deps.ch.qos.logback.core.db.DMCS` in this CVE), which are classes that can perform actions like remote code execution when specific setter methods are called in a specific order, and fields are set.
* **Dependency on vulnerable library**: The specific exploit associated with this CVE requires the presence of the `newrelic-agent` library (version 3.x) in the application's classpath.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to:
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By instantiating a gadget class with malicious code, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Some gadgets may shut down the JVM or operating system.
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Gadgets might be used to expose sensitive information from the file system of the server handling deserialization.
    *  **Data Modification**: Some gadgets might allow for data modification.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Untrusted JSON input:** The attacker must be able to send a specially crafted JSON message to a vulnerable application. This means the application must accept JSON content sent by untrusted clients where the attacker has full control over the JSON being sent.
*   **Polymorphic Deserialization:** The application must be using Jackson's polymorphic type handling (either using `@JsonTypeInfo` or default typing) to deserialize data into an `Object` type or a similar, broad interface like `Serializable` or `Comparable`.
*   **Class Path Vulnerability:**  The application needs to have a vulnerable class like `com.newrelic.agent.deps.ch.qos.logback.core.db.DMCS` in its classpath, that acts as a "gadget".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable application's endpoint where it processes JSON.
*  **JSON Crafting:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious JSON payload that specifies the class name of a gadget class to be deserialized.
* **Knowledge of Gadgets**: The attacker needs to know of a suitable gadget class present in the classpath of the vulnerable application which they can use to perform malicious actions

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information indicates that this is one of several CVEs affecting Jackson databind due to the same root cause.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in Jackson databind versions 2.9.10.8 and later. Earlier versions such as  2.8.x, 2.7.x, and 2.6.x also have patches.
*   The provided text also highlights that avoiding default typing, being explicit about specifying polymorphism, and not using `java.lang.Object` as a nominal type for polymorphic values are important mitigating factors.

In summary, CVE-2020-36189 is a critical vulnerability in Jackson-databind that can lead to Remote Code Execution if an attacker can send a crafted JSON message to an application that uses polymorphic deserialization and has the vulnerable `newrelic-agent` library on its classpath.
