  "cveId": "CVE-2020-36565",
  "description": "Due to improper sanitization of user input on Windows, the static file handler allows for directory traversal, allowing an attacker to read files outside of the target directory that the server has permission to read.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of `path.Clean` instead of `filepath.Clean` when joining the root path with the requested path in the static file server logic. `path.Clean` only normalizes slashes, while `filepath.Clean` normalizes path separators according to the OS, and handles directory traversal sequences such as `..` and `.`",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Directory traversal vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server that the application has permissions to read, potentially leading to information disclosure of sensitive data.",
    "attackVectors": "By sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the server with path traversal sequences (e.g., `..\\`), an attacker can access files outside of the designated static directory.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker only needs to send a crafted HTTP request. No user interaction or privileges are required."
