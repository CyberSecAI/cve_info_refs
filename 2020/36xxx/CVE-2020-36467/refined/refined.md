Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-36467:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from multiple flaws in the implementation of the `Ptr` type within the `cgc` crate in Rust.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unsafe `Send` and `Sync` Implementation:** The `Ptr` type incorrectly implements the `Send` and `Sync` traits for all types `T`, regardless of whether `T` is actually thread-safe. This allows non-thread-safe types like `Rc` and `Cell` to be sent across threads, leading to data races.
2.  **Mutable Alias Violation:** The `Ptr::get()` method returns a mutable reference (`&mut T`) to the underlying data, without ensuring that no other mutable references exist. This violates Rust's aliasing rules and leads to undefined behavior by allowing multiple mutable references to the same memory location.
3.  **Non-Atomic Writes:** The `Ptr::write()` (or `set()`) method performs non-atomic writes to the underlying raw pointer. This is unsafe in a multithreaded context because concurrent writes to the same memory location can lead to data races and unpredictable outcomes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Races:** Due to incorrect `Send` and `Sync` implementations and non-atomic writes, concurrent access to `Ptr` objects from multiple threads can lead to data races, resulting in corrupted data and unpredictable program behavior.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** The violation of Rust's aliasing rules through `Ptr::get()` can lead to undefined behavior, potentially including memory corruption, crashes, or unexpected program results.
*   **Denial of Service:** Although not directly stated, the potential for undefined behavior and data races could lead to application crashes, thus causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by any code that uses the `Ptr` type in a concurrent environment.
*   Specifically, by sharing `Ptr` objects between threads when the underlying data is not thread-safe.
*   By calling `Ptr::get()` multiple times to create aliased mutable references, or `Ptr::write` from different threads concurrently.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code that utilizes the vulnerable `cgc` crate with its flawed `Ptr` implementation.
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the use of `Ptr` objects, especially when shared between threads.
*   No special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `cgc` crate versions `<= 0.4.0`.
*   No patched versions are available.
*   The issue was reported on December 10, 2020, and made public on March 26, 2021.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 5.9 and has a network attack vector, high attack complexity and high availability impact.
* The vulnerability is related to CWE-657: Improper Handling of Thread Synchronization
