The provided content relates to CVE-2020-36438.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `tiny_future` crate's `Future` type lacked bounds on its `Send` and `Sync` traits.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The absence of `Send` and `Sync` trait bounds on the `Future` type allowed non-thread-safe types, such as `Cell`, to be used within `Future`s. This could lead to data races in concurrent programs.

**Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can cause data races, leading to undefined behavior and potentially affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application.

**Attack vectors:** Network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges or user interaction are needed. The attack has high complexity.
