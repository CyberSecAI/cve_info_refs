* `>=0.2.3`

### Description

Affected versions of this crate had a panic safety issue to drop partially uninitialized array of `T` upon panic in a user provided function `T::random()`. Dropping uninitialized `T` can potentially cause memory corruption or undefined behavior.

The flaw was corrected in commit 565d508 by using `MaybeUninit<T>` to avoid possible dropping of uninitialized memory upon panic.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Hello 🦀 ,

we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) found a memory-safety/soundness issue in this crate while scanning Rust code on crates.io for potential vulnerabilities.

## Issue Description

[autorand-rs/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/mersinvald/autorand-rs/blob/c838309507f9364ecf61553a6ae113dd720fdab9/src/lib.rs#L160-L170)

Lines 160 to 170
in
[c838309](/mersinvald/autorand-rs/commit/c838309507f9364ecf61553a6ae113dd720fdab9)

|  | impl<T: Random> Random for [T; $s] { |
| --- | --- |
|  | fn random() -> Self { |
|  | unsafe { |
|  | let mut array: [T; $s] = std::mem::uninitialized(); |
|  | for i in 0..$s { |
|  | std::ptr::write(&mut array[i], T::random()); |
|  | } |
|  | array |
|  | } |
|  | } |
|  | } |

`T::random()` can potentially panic (since `Random` is a public trait and users can implement it on custom types) and if it does,

the partially initialized `array` is dropped. Thus `T::drop()` can be invoked on uninitialized memory, leading to undefined behavior.

Thank you for reviewing this issue 👍
