Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-36210

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from the implementation of the `Random` trait for arrays in the `autorand` crate. Specifically, the `random()` function for arrays used `std::mem::uninitialized()` to create an array of type `T` and then iteratively filled the array with random values of type `T` using `T::random()`. If `T::random()` panics, the partially initialized array would be dropped, potentially causing a double-free or other undefined behavior due to dropping uninitialized memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use of `std::mem::uninitialized()`:** This function creates memory that has not been initialized, which can be unsafe.
- **Panic Unwinding:** If `T::random()` panics while filling the array, the partially initialized array is dropped leading to undefined behavior.
- **Incorrect `Random` trait Implementation:** The implementation didn't handle potential panics within the random generation loop, which lead to the incorrect behavior

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Dropping uninitialized memory can cause memory corruption and lead to undefined behavior.
- **Undefined Behavior:** The undefined behavior could result in program crashes or other unexpected behavior, including denial of service.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Although not explicitly stated, memory corruption vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The vulnerability is triggered locally within the program.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to influence the type `T` used in the array when the `random()` function from the `autorand` crate is used. This would include crafting or forcing conditions where a user-provided `T::random()` implementation panics.
- A low level of privilege is required to trigger the vulnerability, since no specific privileges are mentioned.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
The provided information contains more details than a typical CVE description. Specifically, it includes:
- The exact code snippet that demonstrates the vulnerability.
- The specific mechanism of the vulnerability (panic while filling the array).
- The fix implemented (using `MaybeUninit<T>`).
- The CVSS score and vector.
- References to the commit that fixed the issue.
- A description of how `T::drop()` on uninitialized memory could cause undefined behavior.

In summary, the vulnerability is due to the unsafe way the `Random` trait was implemented for arrays, which could lead to dropping uninitialized memory during a panic within the random value generation. This could result in memory corruption and undefined behavior, including program crashes and potential code execution.
