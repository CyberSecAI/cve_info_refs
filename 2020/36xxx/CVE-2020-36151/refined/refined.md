Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `mysofa_resampler_reset_mem` function within the `speex_resampler.c` file.
*   The function attempts to zero out a memory block using `memset`, but the size of the memory block is calculated incorrectly. Specifically, the size is derived from a value that is cast from -1 to an unsigned integer. This results in a very large memory allocation size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap buffer overflow:** The incorrect memory size calculation leads to a heap buffer overflow when `memset` attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application Crash:** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a crash of the application using the `libmysofa` library.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** While the provided information only indicates a crash, heap buffer overflows can sometimes be leveraged for more severe outcomes like arbitrary code execution, depending on the context and memory layout.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted SOFA file:** The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted SOFA file is opened using the `mysofa_open` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious SOFA file to an application using the `libmysofa` library. This could involve social engineering or network-based attacks if the application processes files from untrusted sources.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided github issue #134 gives the most technical information, including a crash report by AddressSanitizer.
*   The vulnerability affects `libmysofa` versions master (2020-08-26) and 1.1 and possibly older.
*   The fix was included in `libmysofa-1.2-4`.
*   The fix was deployed across Fedora 32, Fedora EPEL 7, and Fedora EPEL 8.
