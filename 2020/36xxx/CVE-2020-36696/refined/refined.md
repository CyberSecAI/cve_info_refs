Root cause of vulnerability:
The plugin's `handle_downloads` function, hooked to `admin_init`, lacks proper authorization checks and input validation.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Unauthenticated arbitrary file download vulnerability due to missing capability checks and input validation in the `handle_downloads` function.
- Path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided file paths.

Impact of exploitation:
- An unauthenticated attacker can download any file from the website, potentially including sensitive files like the `wp-config.php` file containing database credentials.
- This could allow attackers to gain access to the database and take over the website.

Attack vectors:
- Sending a crafted GET request to `admin-post.php` or `admin-ajax.php` with the `alg_wc_pif_download_file` parameter containing a path to the desired file.
- The `admin_init` hook can be triggered by anyone, including unauthenticated users.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
