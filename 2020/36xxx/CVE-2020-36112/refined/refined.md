Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability:** Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities are present in the CSE Bookstore 1.0 web application.

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:**  The application is vulnerable to multiple types of SQL injection:
    *   Time-based blind SQL injection
    *   Boolean-based blind SQL injection
    *   OR error-based SQL injection

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially dump the entire database, including sensitive information like user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **`bookPerPub.php`:** The `pubid` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **`cart.php`:** The `bookisbn` parameter (POST data) is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **`book.php`:** The `bookisbn` parameter (GET data) is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker needs basic understanding of SQL injection to craft the malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**

The provided content includes example SQLMap payloads to test the vulnerabilities, and shows example requests and responses that demonstrate successful exploitation, with database error messages returned to the client.
*   **Time-based blind SQL injection example:**

    ```
    http://192.168.196.83:80/ebook/bookPerPub.php?pubid=' AND (SELECT 6293 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))eqTh)-- CJmT
    ```
*   **Error-based SQL injection example:**

    ```
     http://192.168.196.83:80/ebook/bookPerPub.php?pubid=' OR (SELECT 7393 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x71717a7071,(SELECT (ELT(7393=7393,1))),0x7178716a71,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)-- nkDF
    ```

*   **Boolean based blind SQL injection example:**
    ```
    http://192.168.196.83:80/ebook/bookPerPub.php?pubid=' OR NOT 4138=4138#
    ```
*   **Example exploitation of cart.php:**
    ```
    POST /ebook/cart.php HTTP/1.1
    ...
    bookisbn=978-1-1180-2669-4'&cart=Purchase+%2f+Add+to+cart
    ```

*   **Example exploitation of book.php:**
    ```
    GET /ebook/book.php?bookisbn=978-0-7303-1484-4' HTTP/1.1
    ...
    ```
