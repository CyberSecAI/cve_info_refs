- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `edituser.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection. The application directly uses the `id` parameter from user input in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to data exfiltration, data modification, or even complete control of the database.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP requests, by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL when accessing `edituser.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and identify the vulnerable parameter which is the `id` parameter in the URL.
