Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36152:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Incorrect use of `sprintf` on a buffer that is too small in `dataobject.c:806`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow: Specifically, a 4-byte overflow occurs when writing a string representation of a long hexadecimal value into a fixed-size buffer using `sprintf`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Overwriting the next variable on the stack: The overflow can overwrite adjacent stack variables, potentially leading to:
  - Logic errors in the application: Corrupted stack data can cause the application to behave unexpectedly.
  - Application crash: In cases where there is strong stack protection mechanisms present (e.g., stack canaries), the overflow can lead to a crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted SOFA file: The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a specially crafted SOFA file that contains specific data structures.
- Input file parsing: The vulnerability occurs during the parsing of the SOFA file within the `readDataVar` function, which is called in multiple places.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to supply the application with a malicious SOFA file: An attacker needs to provide a malformed SOFA file to the application that uses `libmysofa`.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The GitHub issue provides a GDB stack trace showing the location of the `sprintf` call.
- A sample crash-triggering file is provided for reproducing the crash.
- The suggested fix is to increase the buffer size, use `snprintf` to limit the number of characters written, and check the return value of `snprintf`.
- The vulnerability has been addressed in libmysofa version 1.2-4, and updates have been pushed to Fedora 32 and EPEL 7 & 8.
