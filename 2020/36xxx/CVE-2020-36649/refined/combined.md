# RegExp used to detect numbers is vulnerable to ReDoS #777

## Description

![@FarSeeing](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/559569?v=4&size=48)[FarSeeing](https://github.com/FarSeeing)opened [on Apr 2, 2020](https://github.com/mholt/PapaParse/issues/777#issue-592543086)

Basically the title says everything.

Node code to test:

```
const Papa = require('papaparse');

const input = '0'.repeat(10000);
const options = {dynamicTyping: true};

let start = process.hrtime.bigint();
Papa.parse(input, options);
let end = process.hrtime.bigint();
console.log(`Numerical input: ${Number(end - start) / 1e9} seconds`);

start = process.hrtime.bigint();
Papa.parse(input + 'a', options);
end = process.hrtime.bigint();
console.log(`Non-numerical input: ${Number(end - start) / 1e9} seconds`);
```

Results on my PC:

For 10000 characters:

```
Numerical input: 0.002068456 seconds
Non-numerical input: 0.574908789 seconds

```

For 100000 characters (note the exponential growth):

```
Numerical input: 0.002522945 seconds
Non-numerical input: 57.080913533 seconds

```

This comes from `var FLOAT = /^\s*-?(\d*\.?\d+|\d+\.?\d*)(e[-+]?\d+)?\s*$/i;` and the issue is in `(\d*\.?\d+|\d+\.?\d*)` segment.

One possible solution - replace current RE with something like `/^\s*-?(\d+\.?|\.\d+|\d+\.\d+)(e[-+]?\d+)?\s*$/`. Looks ugly but it works.
