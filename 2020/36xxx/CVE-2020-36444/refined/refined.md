Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-36444:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the incorrect implementation of `Send` and `Sync` traits for the `ArcGuard<RC, T>` struct in the `async-coap` crate. Specifically, the implementation lacked trait bounds on the generic type `RC`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Trait Bounds:**  The `ArcGuard` struct implemented `Send` if `T: Send` and `Sync` if `T: Sync`, without requiring that `RC` also satisfy `Send` or `Sync` when necessary. This is a critical oversight since `RC` is part of the shared data structure.
- **Unsafe Concurrency:**  The missing bounds allowed users to send types that are not `Send` (`RC: !Send`) to other threads. It also permitted concurrent access to types that are not `Sync` (`Rc: !Sync`) from multiple threads. This is in violation of Rust's safety guarantees.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Races:** The primary impact is the introduction of data races, where multiple threads access and modify shared memory concurrently without proper synchronization.
- **Memory Corruption:** Data races can lead to memory corruption, resulting in undefined behavior.
- **Undefined Behavior:** The lack of proper synchronization can lead to a variety of unexpected behaviors, including crashes and incorrect program logic.
- **Potential for Segmentation Faults:** The provided proof-of-concept code demonstrates how the vulnerability can result in a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) by dereferencing corrupted memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The CVSS vector specifies the attack vector as network, implying that the vulnerability can be triggered remotely. However, the vulnerability lies in incorrect usage of a concurrency primitive and thus requires the program to use the affected code.
- **Concurrency:** The vulnerability is triggered by concurrent access from multiple threads to shared data protected using the vulnerable struct.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Code Execution:**  An attacker needs to be able to execute code that uses the vulnerable `async-coap` crate and specifically relies on `ArcGuard` in a multi-threaded scenario.
- **Control of Threading:** An attacker must be able to influence or control how threads are spawned and data is shared between them.
- **Usage of ArcGuard:** An attacker must be able to make a program use `ArcGuard` with a type `RC` that does not satisfy the `Send` or `Sync` bounds when used in multithreaded context.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of the crate `async-coap` up to and including version 0.1.0.
- The issue was identified by the Rust group at sslab-gatech.
- The vulnerability is identified as both RUSTSEC-2020-0124, CVE-2020-36444, and GHSA-9j8q-m9x5-9g6j.
- There is no patch available to correct this vulnerability; the crate is archived.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) and CWE-362 (Race Condition).
