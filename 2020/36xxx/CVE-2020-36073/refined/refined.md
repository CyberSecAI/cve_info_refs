The provided content contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2020-36073.

**CVE-2020-36073**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application constructs an SQL query using unsanitized user-supplied data. Specifically, the `detail` parameter from the POST request is directly embedded into the SQL query within the `document.php` file.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization or use of prepared statements when constructing the SQL query. The `$detail` POST parameter is not validated or sanitized before being included in the INSERT query.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: A successful SQL injection attack can lead to unauthorized viewing of user data, deletion of tables, or gaining administrative access to the database, all of which can severely damage the business.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   The attacker must be authenticated to access the `document.php` page.
    *   The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `document.php` page, inserting malicious SQL code into the `detail` parameter.
    *   The vulnerable code in `document.php` executes the unsanitized query, leading to SQL injection.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker must be authenticated to access the vulnerable page.
    *   The attacker can use tools like Burp Suite to intercept and modify HTTP requests to inject malicious SQL code.
