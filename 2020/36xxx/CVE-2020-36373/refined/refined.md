The provided content is related to CVE-2020-36373.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by excessive recursion during the parsing of complex expressions in the `mjs` JavaScript engine. Specifically, the parsing functions, such as `parse_unary`, `parse_mul_div_rem`, and `parse_plus_minus`, call each other recursively without proper checks, leading to stack overflow when parsing deeply nested expressions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper limits on the depth of recursive calls in the parser.
- Recursive parsing functions that can call each other, creating an opportunity for unbounded recursion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stack overflow, causing the program to crash.
- Denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a malicious crafted JavaScript code with a deeply nested expression to the vulnerable `mjs` engine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide input (JavaScript code) to the `mjs` engine.
