The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in the Sky File v2.1.0 iOS application: a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability and a directory traversal vulnerability.

**1. Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation in the `createFolder` module of the application's web interface. The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input when creating a new folder, allowing injection of malicious script code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Persistent XSS vulnerability. The injected script is stored and executed when the folder is accessed by a user.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Persistent phishing attacks
    *   Persistent external redirects
    *   Manipulation of the web context within the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote attackers with access to the application's web interface via WiFi.
    *   The attack vector is located on the application-side via POST requests.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be on the same WiFi network as the device running the Sky File application.
    *   The attacker needs to interact with the vulnerable `createFolder` module using crafted POST requests.

**2. Directory Traversal**

*   **Root Cause:** Insecure FTP server configuration and path validation. The application allows an anonymous user to connect to the built-in FTP server. By exploiting a misconfiguration, an attacker can bypass the intended directory restrictions and access the root application directory. The vulnerability stems from the app's acceptance of `/null//` in conjunction with `CWD` and `CDUP` FTP commands.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Directory traversal vulnerability leading to unauthorized file system access.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Unauthorized file system access.
    *   Information disclosure.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote attackers with access to the application's FTP server via WiFi.
    *   The vulnerability is exploited through a sequence of crafted FTP commands and path manipulations.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be on the same WiFi network as the device running the Sky File application.
    *   The attacker needs to connect to the FTP server with anonymous credentials.
    *   The attacker needs to use a FTP client to send specific commands.
