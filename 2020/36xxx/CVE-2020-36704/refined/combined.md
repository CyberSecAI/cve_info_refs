### Description

The Fruitful Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters stored via the fruitful\_theme\_options\_action AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 3.8.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

# Authenticated stored XSS vulnerability in WordPress Fruitful theme.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [March 13, 2020 - 1:04pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/authenticated-stored-xss-vulnerability-in-wordpress-fruitful-theme/)

The WordPress [Fruitful theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/fruitful/), which has 9,000+ active installations, was prone to an authenticated stored XSS vulnerability in version 3.8.1 and below.

### Authenticated Stored XSS

In the “inc/func/fruitful-function.php” script, the theme registers the `fruitful_theme_options_action` action via the `wp_ajax_*` AJAX hook:

```

add_action('wp_ajax_fruitful_theme_options_action', 'fruitful_data_save');
function fruitful_data_save() {
global $fruitful_theme_options;
   $data = $_POST[$fruitful_theme_options->args['opt_name']];
   foreach ( $fruitful_theme_options->sections as $section => $data_f ) {
      foreach ( $data_f['fields'] as $field ) {
         $id = (isset($field['id' ])) ? $field['id'] : '';
         $type = (isset($field['type'])) ? $field['type'] : '';
            if ($type == 'checkbox') {
               if (!isset($data[$id])) {$data[$id] = 'off'; }
            }
            if ($type == 'textarea') {
               if (isset($data[$id])) {$data[$id] = stripslashes($data[$id]);}
            }
         if (!empty ($field['fields'])) {
            foreach ($field['fields'] as $sub_field) {
               $id  = (isset($sub_field['id' ])) ? $sub_field['id'] : '';
               $type = (isset($sub_field['type'])) ? $sub_field['type'] : '';
               if ($type == 'checkbox') {
                  if (!isset($data[$id])) {$data[$id] = 'off'; }
               }
               if ($type == 'textarea') {
                  if (isset($data[$id])) {$data[$id] = stripslashes($data[$id]);}
               }
            }
         }
      }
   }
   if (!isset($data['reset'])) {$data['reset']   = 'reset';}
   if(!empty($data)) {
      if(update_option('fruitful_theme_options', $data)) {
         die('1');
      } else {
         die('0');
      }
   } else {
      die('1');
   }

}

```

The function doesn’t check user capabilities and lacks a security nonce and thus is accessible to any logged-in user. Because some fields like `fruitful_theme_options[custom_css]` are not sanitized, an attacker can inject JavaScript code into every page and post of the blog:

![Fruitful theme vulnerability](../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fruitful-theme-xss-vulnerability.png)

The stored XSS can also be used to target administrators when they edit the theme in the back-end section of WordPress:

![Fruitful theme vulnerability](../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fruitful-theme-xss-vulnerability-backend.png)

### Additional Issues

Three other AJAX actions that should be accessible to the administrator only are accessible to any authenticated users:

* `fruitful_reset_btn`: this action will delete the theme options.
* `fruitful_add_new_slide_action`: this action only adds one or more input fields while editing the theme. No damage can be done to the website though.
* `run_import_dummy_data`: this action will throw a fatal error because it attempts to call another function that does not exist.

### Recommendations

Update as soon as possible if you have version 3.8.1 or below installed.

If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.

### Timeline

The vulnerability was reported to the wordpress.org team on March 04, 2020 and a new version 3.8.2 was released on March 08, 2020.
