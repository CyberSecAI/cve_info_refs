Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the "Fruitful" WordPress theme when handling data submitted via AJAX. Specifically, the `fruitful_theme_options_action` AJAX action does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before saving it into the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via theme options and stored in the database.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The `fruitful_theme_options_action` action, intended for theme options updates, lacks proper capability checks and security nonces, making it accessible to any authenticated user, even those with subscriber-level permissions. This allows lower-privileged users to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Insecure Data Handling:** The theme uses `stripslashes()` on 'textarea' fields, which is inadequate for preventing XSS, as it doesn't neutralize HTML entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes whenever a user (including administrators) visits pages where the injected code is displayed or in the backend of the theme editing section,  potentially leading to:
    *   **Data Theft:**  Stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
    *   **Account Hijacking:** Redirecting users to phishing pages or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Website Defacement:** Altering the content and appearance of the website.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or attempting to download malware.
*   **Theme Option Reset:** Lower-privileged users can also reset theme options using `fruitful_reset_btn`.
*   **Fatal Error:** While not a security issue, `run_import_dummy_data` causes a fatal error as it attempts to call a non-existent function.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **AJAX Request:** Attackers craft a malicious AJAX request to the `fruitful_theme_options_action` with harmful JavaScript code in theme option parameters, such as `custom_css`.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be logged into the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the affected WordPress site with at least subscriber level permissions.
*   **Network Access:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the target website.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Theme:** Familiarity with the themeâ€™s AJAX action and affected parameters to successfully craft an attack.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported on March 4, 2020, and a patched version (3.8.2) was released on March 8, 2020.
*   The `fruitful_add_new_slide_action` was also accessible to any authenticated user but doesn't seem to introduce a vulnerability since it only add input fields, and the `run_import_dummy_data` causes a fatal error but is not exploitable.
