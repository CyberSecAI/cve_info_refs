Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-36636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the account setup pages of the OpenMRS Admin UI module. Specifically, user-controlled variables (like username, family name, given name, and gender) were not properly encoded before being added to the model and displayed on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding of user-provided data in the `AccountPageController.java` file. This allows a malicious user to inject client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into the application through the vulnerable fields.
- **Unencoded User Data:** The application was directly inserting user-provided strings into the HTML context without escaping or encoding, which allows the browser to interpret the strings as executable code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker could potentially steal sensitive information such as session cookies, which could lead to account hijacking.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the appearance or behavior of the webpage.
- **Phishing:** The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website or display fake login forms to steal credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The attacker crafts malicious input containing JavaScript code in the user account setup form fields (e.g., username, family name, given name, gender).
- **Server-Side Injection:** This malicious input is sent to the server and stored as unencoded data.
- **Client-Side Execution:** When the server renders the user account page and includes the stored user data, the browser executes the injected JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be able to access the account setup pages to input malicious data.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the lack of sanitization in the specific vulnerable fields in the account setup process.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was mitigated by adding HTML encoding of user-controlled variables before they are included in the model. The fix was implemented in commit `702fbfd` and included in release `1.5.0`. The code changes involved using `uu.encodeHtml()` to encode user-provided strings before including them in the model, preventing the browser from interpreting them as executable code.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was identified by the NC State team.
- The vulnerability was addressed by performing "the most aggressive html-encoding" on the user input to prevent any XSS attack.
- The fix targeted `AccountPageController.java` which was modified to use `uu.encodeHtml()` function to sanitize input.
