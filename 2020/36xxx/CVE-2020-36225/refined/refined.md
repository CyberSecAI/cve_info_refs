Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36225:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content, particularly from `bugs.openldap.org_6b7ffd81_20250119_112302.html`, `www.debian.org_7928dc3e_20250119_112316.html`, `lists.debian.org_725f2f7a_20250119_112309.html`, `support.apple.com_8ceea726_20250119_112314.html`, `support.apple.com_4d789578_20250119_112311.html`, `seclists.org_5bafc3ed_20250119_112259.html`, `security.netapp.com_51fb8481_20250119_112310.html`, `support.apple.com_7cdc7d96_20250119_112313.html` and `seclists.org_2d4a74d6_20250119_112300.html`, clearly indicates that CVE-2020-36225 is related to a double-free vulnerability in OpenLDAP. The description of the vulnerability aligns with the information within the provided resources, confirming its relevance to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause of the vulnerability is a double-free issue. Specifically, it occurs within the handling of the `saslAuthzTo` attribute during a modify operation. The vulnerability arises when the code attempts to free the same memory location multiple times.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Double Free:** The core vulnerability is a double free, meaning a memory location is freed more than once. This leads to memory corruption and program crashes.
   - The vulnerability is triggered when processing the `saslAuthzTo` attribute.
  - Incorrect handling of DN normalization during saslAuthz processing leads to the double free.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. The double free leads to the `slapd` daemon crashing.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted LDAP packet containing the `saslAuthzTo` attribute during a modify operation.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the LDAP service.
   - **LDAP Interaction:** The attacker must be able to send LDAP packets to the server.
   - **Unauthenticated:**  The vulnerability is exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker.

**7. Additional Details:**
    - The issue is related to improper handling of the AVA_Sort on invalid RDN
    - The issue was fixed in git commit `5a2017d4`.
    - The vulnerability exists in OpenLDAP versions prior to 2.4.57.

In summary, CVE-2020-36225 is a double-free vulnerability in OpenLDAP triggered when processing `saslAuthzTo` attributes, leading to denial of service. It's exploitable remotely without authentication, making it a significant security issue for affected systems.
