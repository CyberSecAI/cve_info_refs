Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-36709:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Page Builder: KingComposer plugin for WordPress. Specifically, several shortcode filters do not properly escape attributes, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious code.
*   The plugin also uses a nonce for security checks that is leaked on the `/wp-admin/index.php` page, accessible to any logged-in user. This weakness combined with lack of validation for certain actions allowed privilege escalation and remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin's shortcode functionality allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary web scripts (HTML/JavaScript) via shortcode attributes, which are then stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected pages.
*  **Broken Access Control:** The plugin leaks a security nonce, which is used for many AJAX actions, making it possible for low-privileged users to perform admin actions.
*   **WordPress Options Change:** An authenticated user can use the `kc_update_option` AJAX action to modify any WordPress option in the database.
*   **Arbitrary File/Folder Deletion:** The `kc_installed_extensions` AJAX action can be exploited to recursively delete arbitrary folders and files due to improper path validation.
*   **Content Injection:** The `kc_push_section` AJAX action allows an attacker to inject or overwrite content on any page or post.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The plugin's extension upload functionality does not validate file extensions, allowing a malicious user to upload a ZIP file containing PHP scripts and execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Malicious scripts can be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of a user, causing damage to the site or user.
*   **WordPress Options Change:** An attacker could enable user registration and promote themself to an administrator, modify the site URL to redirect traffic, or disable crucial functionality.
*   **Arbitrary File/Folder Deletion:** This can cause data loss, rendering a website unusable or causing additional damage.
*   **Content Injection:** Attackers could deface websites, inject malicious links, or spread malware.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can gain complete control of the server and the website to steal data, install malware, or cause further damage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Injection:** Attacker crafts a malicious shortcode and adds it to any page or post.
*   **AJAX Actions:** By sending specially crafted requests to vulnerable AJAX endpoints (e.g., `kc_update_option`, `kc_installed_extensions`, `kc_push_section`, `kc_load_section`), attackers can modify WordPress options, delete files, inject content, and potentially view protected content.
*   **Extension Upload:** Attacker uploads a malicious ZIP file containing PHP code through the extension upload functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Stored XSS:** Authenticated user with the capability to create or edit page content.
*   **Other Vulnerabilities:** Authenticated user (even subscriber level) is sufficient to exploit broken access control, option changes, file/folder deletion, or content injection via AJAX requests.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Authenticated user with `upload_files` capability such as an author or editor to upload malicious files via the extension upload functionality.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.9.4 of the KingComposer plugin.
* The leaked nonce is the same across all users and actions, making it easy for an attacker to reuse and exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   The `process_bulk_action` function for extensions is loaded using the `init` hook, making it available on every page load and increasing the attack surface.
