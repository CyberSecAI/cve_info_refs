Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36167:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from Veritas Backup Exec using an OpenSSL component that attempts to load a configuration file (`openssl.cnf`) from a fixed path `/usr/local/ssl/`. On Windows, this path translates to `C:\usr\local\ssl`, which is a location where unprivileged users can create directories and files by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure Default Path:** The hardcoded `OPENSSLDIR` path (`/usr/local/ssl/`) is writable by unprivileged users on Windows systems.
- **Privileged Service:** The vulnerable OpenSSL component is used by a privileged Backup Exec service, which runs with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The service doesn't validate or sanitize the contents of the configuration file before loading it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can create a malicious `openssl.cnf` file within the vulnerable directory (`C:\usr\local\ssl\`) and inject a malicious OpenSSL engine
- **Privilege Escalation:** When the Backup Exec service starts, it will load the malicious OpenSSL engine specified by the crafted configuration file. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Complete System Takeover:** With SYSTEM privileges, the attacker gains full control over the compromised system, allowing them to access all data, applications, and potentially affect the entire domain if it's a domain controller.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local File System:** The vulnerability is exploited by creating a malicious file in the file system of the target machine.
- **Configuration File Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the OpenSSL configuration file loaded by the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the Windows system.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker doesn't require any special privileges within the Backup Exec application. Any low-privilege user can create the required directory and file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Backup Exec server installations, not the Backup Exec agents.
- The vendor acknowledges that older, unsupported versions may be affected too.
- Patches are available for Backup Exec 21.x and 20.x, and upgrading is recommended for version 16.x and older.
- A mitigation is to create the directory `C:\usr\local\ssl` and restrict the ACLs to prevent unprivileged users from writing to the folder. This prevents an attacker from placing a malicious configuration file in the directory.
