Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36429:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is related to an "UNKNOWN WRITE" within the `Variant_encodeJson` function in the open62541 library. This appears to stem from a missing or insufficient check for the maximum recursion depth during JSON encoding, leading to a potential stack overflow or other memory corruption issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Recursion Depth Check:** The code lacked proper checks for maximum recursion depth in several places during JSON encoding. Specifically, the vulnerability was identified in `Variant_encodeJson`, which is used when encoding complex data structures to JSON. This lack of checking could lead to excessive recursion, leading to a crash.
- **Potential Memory Corruption**: The root cause leads to potential memory corruption issues, which can be triggered by crafting malicious JSON data structures with excessive nesting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. By sending a crafted JSON structure with excessive nesting, an attacker could cause the application to crash due to stack overflow, rendering it unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted JSON payloads to the affected system.
- **Data Input:** The attack vector is through the processing of JSON data during encoding.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send data to the vulnerable system.
- **Knowledge of Target API:** The attacker needs to understand the API and the expected data format for the JSON encoding functionality in order to craft a malicious JSON payload with excessive nesting.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix implemented in commit `c800e2987b10bb3af6ef644b515b5d6392f8861d` involved adding recursion depth checks to more places within the JSON encoding process.
- The vulnerability was present in versions of `open62541` up to and including v1.0.3.
- The commit also corrected an existing recursion check from `ctx->depth > UA_JSON_ENCODING_MAX_RECURSION` to `ctx->depth >= UA_JSON_ENCODING_MAX_RECURSION` in multiple locations within `src/ua_types_encoding_json.c`
