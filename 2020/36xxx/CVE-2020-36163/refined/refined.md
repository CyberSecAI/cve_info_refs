- **Root cause of vulnerability**: NetBackup processes using Strawberry Perl attempt to load and execute libraries from paths that do not exist by default on the Windows operating system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from insecure library loading practices in NetBackup and OpsCenter software, where Strawberry Perl attempts to load libraries from non-existent paths, allowing a low-privileged user to create these paths and place malicious libraries. This is a classic DLL hijacking vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a low-privileged user to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM or Administrator privileges. This enables the attacker to gain full control over the affected system, potentially accessing all data and applications.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to have a low-privileged user account on a vulnerable Windows system. They create directories that NetBackup attempts to load libraries from, and place their own malicious DLL files into those directories. The vulnerable software will then load and execute these malicious DLL files with elevated privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires a low-privileged user account on the Windows machine where NetBackup is installed. They need the ability to create directories on the system. The attacker also needs the capability to create malicious DLL libraries.
