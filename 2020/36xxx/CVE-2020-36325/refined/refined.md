The provided content describes a bug report for an out-of-bounds read vulnerability found in the Jansson library.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `string_get` function within `load.c`. The fuzzer input leads to an invalid memory access while parsing JSON data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption and program crash (Segmentation fault)

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a crafted JSON string as input to the `json_loads` function

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control the input of the `json_loads` function, typically via a file or network stream.
- No special privileges or specific network positions are required.
