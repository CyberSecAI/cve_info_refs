Hi,

I encountered an OOB read memory corruption bug when fuzzing Jansson.

Below you can find the crash log:

```

The fuzzer I used was:

```
#include <jansson.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const char *Data, size_t Size) {
        FILE *devNull;

        devNull = fopen("/dev/null", "w");

        json_t *root;
        json_error_t error;

        root = json_loads(Data, 0, &error);

        json_dumpf(root, devNull, 0);
        json_decref(root);

        fclose(devNull);

        return 0;
}

```

Kind Regards,

Jordy Zomer
