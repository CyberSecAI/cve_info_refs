Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36719:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `lp_cc_addons_actions` function within the ListingPro WordPress theme lacks proper authorization checks. Specifically, it doesn't verify if the user performing the action is an administrator.
*   The function is registered for both authenticated and unauthenticated users (`wp_ajax_nopriv_*`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Capability Check:** The `lp_cc_addons_actions` function does not check user capabilities before allowing plugin installation, activation, or deactivation.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The function is accessible to unauthenticated users due to the use of `wp_ajax_nopriv_*`, which bypasses the need for login.
*   **Lack of Security Nonce:** There is no security nonce implemented to protect against CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Plugin Installation:** Attackers can install any plugin from a remote URL (ZIP file), which will then be extracted to the plugins folder and activated.
*   **Arbitrary Plugin Activation/Deactivation:** Attackers can activate or deactivate any plugin installed on the WordPress site, which may disable security measures or install malicious plugins.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Through the `/wp-admin/index.php?download-lp-users=yes` endpoint, attackers can download a CSV file containing user details, including username, full name, email address and phone number.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access to AJAX Actions:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted AJAX request to the `lp_cc_addons_actions` endpoint without authentication.
*   **Remote File Inclusion:** When installing a plugin, the attacker provides a URL to a remote ZIP file, which can be controlled by the attacker.
*   **Direct HTTP Request** Sending a GET request to `/wp-admin/index.php?download-lp-users=yes` allows the attacker to download the information disclosure CSV.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need any prior access to the WordPress site or an account. They can exploit the vulnerability remotely as long as the vulnerable theme is in use on the target site.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `listingpro-plugin/inc/command-center/commandcenter-function.php` for the arbitrary plugin installation/activation/deactivation and `listingpro-plugin/functions.php` for the information disclosure.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.6.1 of the ListingPro theme.
*   The `is_admin()` check in the `listingpro-plugin/functions.php` file does not verify if the user is an administrator and allows any user to access the data export functionality.
