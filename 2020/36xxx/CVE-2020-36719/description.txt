The ListingPro - WordPress Directory & Listing Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary Plugin Installation, Activation and Deactivation in versions before 2.6.1. This is due to a missing capability check on the lp_cc_addons_actions function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily install, activate and deactivate any plugin.
