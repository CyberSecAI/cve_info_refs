Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-36328:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `WebPDecode*Into` functions within the libwebp library. This occurs due to an invalid check for buffer size during the decoding process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** A memory corruption vulnerability that occurs when data is written past the allocated buffer on the heap, potentially overwriting adjacent data structures.
*   **Invalid buffer size check:** The code responsible for verifying the buffer's capacity before writing data doesn't correctly calculate the necessary size, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Confidentiality:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from memory by overflowing the buffer into adjacent memory regions.
*   **Data Integrity:** An attacker might be able to modify data stored in memory, leading to unexpected program behavior or corruption.
*  **System Availability:** A successful overflow can cause the program to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  In some cases, a carefully crafted overflow can be used to inject and execute arbitrary code, potentially giving the attacker control of the system or application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted WebP images:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted WebP image that triggers the buffer overflow when it's processed by the vulnerable software.
*   **Processing of malicious Web content:** Web content that relies on vulnerable libwebp versions might lead to exploitation via the browser by rendering manipulated WebP image files

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide a crafted WebP image:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially created image to the targeted application or system. This could be achieved through various means such as:
    *   Hosting the image on a website that is visited by the target user (if the vulnerability is in the browser).
    *   Sending the image as an attachment through a communication medium (if the vulnerability is in an image processing tool).
    *  Embedding the malicious image inside other files, like PDFs or office documents, that use the vulnerable library.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in libwebp versions before 1.0.1.
*   The fix involves correcting the buffer size check within the `WebPDecode*Into` functions.
*   Multiple vendors, such as Apple, Red Hat, Debian, and NetApp, were affected and issued security updates to address the vulnerability in their respective products.
* The vulnerability was fixed in libwebp version 1.0.1.
