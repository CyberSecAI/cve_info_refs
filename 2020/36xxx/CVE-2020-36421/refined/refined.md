Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36421:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a side-channel issue in modular exponentiation. The time it takes to resume an instruction depends on its location within a 16-byte fetch window and instructions near it. This timing difference can be exploited to infer the control flow of the program, even in balanced branches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Side-channel vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the timing variations of instruction execution within the processor's fetch window.
- **Information Leakage:** The timing differences leak information about the control flow, potentially revealing sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **RSA Private Key Exposure:** An attacker can potentially recover the RSA private key used in a secure enclave by observing the timing variations during modular exponentiation.
- **Control-flow Leakage**:  An attacker can determine the control flow of a program even in balanced branches, which might lead to further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Timing analysis:**  The attack relies on precise timing measurements of the instruction execution within the CPU.
- **Secure Enclave Environment:** The attack is most effective in environments such as secure enclaves, where an attacker might have more control over the timing and memory access information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Precise Timing Measurement:** The attacker needs to be able to measure the execution time of instructions with high precision.
- **Access to Timing Information:** The attacker needs access to information about the timing of operations inside the target environment, such as a secure enclave.
- **Ability to induce execution of the vulnerable code:**  The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Microsoft Research.
- The vulnerability is related to the way the processor fetches and executes instructions, specifically within a 16-byte aligned window.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by removing the secret-dependent branch altogether from the code.
- The specific code location requiring fixes is `mpi_montmul` (bignum.c: 1924).
- Patches for this vulnerability were included in mbedTLS versions 2.16.7 and 2.23.0
- Gentoo bug report 730752 tracks this issue along with CVE-2020-36422 and CVE-2020-36423, and indicates that the fix has been backported.
- Debian LTS advisory DLA-3249-1 indicates that the issue has been fixed in `mbedtls` version 2.16.9-0~deb10u1.
