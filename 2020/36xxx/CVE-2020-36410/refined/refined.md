Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:** The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in various features of CMS Made Simple v2.2.14, allowing injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores user-provided input without proper sanitization, and renders this input on subsequent page views, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. Multiple instances of stored XSS were found in the following features:
    *   Manage Shortcuts
    *   Categories (via "Settings - New Module")
    *   Options (via "Settings - New Module")
    *   Content Editing Settings (via "Settings - Global Settings")
    *   Admin Search (via "Extensions")
    *   Maintenance Mode (via "Settings - Global Settings")
    *   News (via "Content")
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects user-provided input in the response without proper sanitization, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. Two instances were found in the Design Manager feature in the following locations:
    *   Stylesheets
    *   Designs

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Stealing session cookies and other sensitive information.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Defacement of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through the CMS administrative interface. An authenticated malicious user can insert malicious scripts into various input fields.
*   For stored XSS, the injected script will be executed when other users access the affected features. For reflected XSS, the injected script will be executed on the submitter's browser only.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have valid login credentials for the CMS Made Simple admin panel.

**Additional Details:**
*   The report includes specific steps to reproduce each vulnerability, making it easier to understand the attack vectors.
*   The report mentions that some of the vulnerabilities were fixed in later versions.
*   Some XSS issues were not fixed, particularly those where only the submitting user is affected, and where the values are not stored.
