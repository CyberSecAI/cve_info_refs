{
  "CVE-2020-36564": {
    "Description": "Due to improper validation of caller input, validation is silently disabled if the provided expected token is malformed, causing any user supplied token to be considered valid.",
    "Root cause": "The `VerifyToken` function in the `nosurf` package did not properly validate input tokens. Specifically, if the provided 'real' token (the expected token) was malformed (e.g., not a valid base64 string or empty), the validation would fail silently and any 'sent' token would be considered valid.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Silent failure leading to bypass of CSRF protection"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit would allow an attacker to bypass CSRF protection, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on behalf of a victim user.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited if an attacker can control the `realToken` argument passed to `VerifyToken`. This could occur if developers misuse the API or if other exploits exist which manipulate the token before being passed to `VerifyToken`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a manipulated or invalid token as the 'realToken', while providing the forged token as the 'sentToken'. This could be achieved by exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow modification of the token."
