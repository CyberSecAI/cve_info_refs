## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Dec 8, 2020](https://github.com/Devolutions/gfwx-rs/issues/7#issue-759137286)

Hi there, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are scanning crates on crates.io for potential soundness bugs. We noticed that ImageChunkMut implements `Send` and `Sync` for all types:

[gfwx-rs/src/processing/image.rs](https://github.com/Devolutions/gfwx-rs/blob/59521ca48f635a5a467d73f29bdbb1a6494a455d/src/processing/image.rs#L160-L161)

Lines 160 to 161
in
[59521ca](/Devolutions/gfwx-rs/commit/59521ca48f635a5a467d73f29bdbb1a6494a455d)

|  | unsafe impl<T> Send for ImageChunkMut<'\_, T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<T> Sync for ImageChunkMut<'\_, T> {} |

However, this should probably be bound by `T: Send` and `T: Sync` respectively.

I realize this is an image library and the `T` will likely be a numeric type but without these bounds its possible to create data races from safe rust code and cause memory safety issues. Here's a rather contrived example where an "image" is backed by Cells causing a segfault from safe rust code:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use gfwx::processing::image::Image;

use crossbeam_utils::thread;
use std::cell::Cell;

// A simple tagged union used to demonstrate problems with data races in Cell.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum RefOrInt {
    Ref(&'static u64),
    Int(u64),
}
static SOME_INT: u64 = 123;

fn main() {
    let cell = Cell::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
    let slice = &mut [&cell];

    let image = Image::from_slice(slice, (1, 1), 1);

    let mut chunk_iterator = image.into_chunks_mut(1, 1);
    let image_chunk = chunk_iterator.next().unwrap();

    thread::scope(|s| {
        s.spawn(|_| {
            let smuggled_cell = image_chunk[(0, 0)];

            loop {
                // Repeatedly write Ref(&addr) and Int(0xdeadbeef) into the cell.
                smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
                smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
            }
        });

        loop {
            if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = cell.get() {
                // Hope that between the time we pattern match the object as a
                // `Ref`, it gets written to by the other thread.
                if addr as *const u64 == &SOME_INT as *const u64 { continue; }

                println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
                println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
            }
        }
    });
}
```

Output:

```
Pointer is now: 0xdeadbeef

Terminated with signal 11 (SIGSEGV)

```

### Description

In the affected versions of this crate, `ImageChunkMut<'_, T>` unconditionally implements `Send` and `Sync`, allowing to create data races.

This can result in a memory corruption or undefined behavior when non thread-safe types are moved and referenced across thread boundaries.

The flaw was corrected in commit e7fb2f5 by adding `T: Send` bound to the `Send` impl and adding `T: Sync` bound to the `Sync` impl.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
