Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36211:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `ImageChunkMut<'_, T>` struct in the `gfwx` crate incorrectly implemented `Send` and `Sync` traits unconditionally, without requiring the inner type `T` to also be `Send` and `Sync`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unconditional `Send` and `Sync` implementations for `ImageChunkMut<'_, T>`.
- This allowed non-thread-safe types to be moved and referenced across thread boundaries, leading to data races.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption.
- Undefined behavior.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution (although the provided example demonstrates a segmentation fault due to data race).

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through local access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to compile and execute code using the vulnerable `gfwx` library.
- Low privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required.

**Technical Details**
- The issue arises from the unsafe implementations of `Send` and `Sync` traits for `ImageChunkMut<'_, T>` in `gfwx-rs/src/processing/image.rs`.
- The provided code example demonstrates a data race scenario using `Cell`, which is not thread-safe, within an `ImageChunkMut`, leading to a segmentation fault.
- The fix involves adding `T: Send` and `T: Sync` bounds to the `Send` and `Sync` implementations for `ImageChunkMut<'_, T>`, respectively, ensuring that the inner type `T` is thread-safe before allowing it to be used in a multi-threaded context.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity.
- The affected versions are `< 0.3.0` and the patched version is `0.3.0`.
- The vulnerability is tracked as `RUSTSEC-2020-0104` and `GHSA-xp6v-qx65-4pp7`.
- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).
