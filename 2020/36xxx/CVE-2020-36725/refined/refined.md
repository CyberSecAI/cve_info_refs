Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-36725

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `ti-woocommerce-wishlist/includes/export.class.php` file. This file handles both import and export functionalities. Specifically, the import function, which is loaded via the `admin_action_` hook, lacks capability verification and security nonce implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the absence of proper authorization checks. This allows any authenticated user, regardless of their role or permissions, to access and execute the import functionality.
*   **Missing Security Nonce:** The lack of a security nonce makes the function vulnerable to CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks, though exploitation would require an authenticated user to be tricked into performing a specific request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Option Updates:** Attackers can modify any WordPress options in the `wp_options` table, due to missing authorization checks within the plugin's import functionality.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can enable user registration and set the default role to "administrator", allowing them to create a new admin account, and effectively take over the site.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers could change the siteurl option to redirect traffic to an external malicious website.
*   **Full Site Compromise:** By modifying various settings, attackers could potentially achieve complete control over the WordPress site and its database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** Exploitation occurs over the network using HTTP requests.
*   **File:** The vulnerable code resides in the `ti-woocommerce-wishlist/includes/export.class.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the WordPress site. This could be a customer account, as WooCommerce allows customer registration by default.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP POST requests to the WordPress admin interface.
*   **Bypass Restrictions**:  Attackers bypass the default WooCommerce restriction by adding the `?wc-ajax=1` query to the URI.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in both the free and pro versions of the plugin, `TI WooCommerce Wishlist` and `TI WooCommerce Wishlist Pro`, respectively.
*   The vulnerability was actively being exploited at the time of discovery.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the plugin authors and a fix was released.
*   The issue is classified as Broken Access Control (OWASP A5) and CWE-284 (Improper Access Control).
