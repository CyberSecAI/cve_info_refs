{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `SyncChannel` type in the `signal-simple` crate incorrectly implemented `Send` and `Sync` traits unconditionally, without requiring the contained type `T` to also implement `Send`. This allows non-`Send` types to be moved between threads.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unconditional implementation of `Send` and `Sync` traits for `SyncChannel<T>`",
      "Data races due to shared mutable state",
       "Incorrect thread safety implementation"
    ],
    "impact": "Users can create undefined behavior (UB) in safe Rust code by sending types that are not safe to share between threads (i.e., `!Send` types). This can lead to data races, memory corruption, and the unlocking of mutexes from a thread that did not lock them. Specifically, using types like `Arc<Cell<_>>` can cause data races, and using `MutexGuard<T>` can cause incorrect mutex unlocking.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by creating a `SyncChannel` and sending a `!Send` type to another thread via the channel's `send` and `recv` methods.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to write Rust code using the `signal-simple` crate. No special privileges are required."
