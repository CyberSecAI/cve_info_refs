## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Nov 15, 2020](https://github.com/kitsuneninetails/signal-rust/issues/2#issue-743213945)

Hi there, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are scanning crates on crates.io for potential soundness bugs. We noticed that the `SyncChannel` object implements `Send` and `Sync` unconiditionally:

[signal-rust/src/channel.rs](https://github.com/kitsuneninetails/signal-rust/blob/2d671bde04b87c741134e5e1a5cd491ae54768e6/src/channel.rs#L58-L59)

Lines 58 to 59
in
[2d671bd](/kitsuneninetails/signal-rust/commit/2d671bde04b87c741134e5e1a5cd491ae54768e6)

|  | unsafe impl<T> Send for SyncChannel<T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<T> Sync for SyncChannel<T> {} |

However, this should probably be bounded by T: Send in both, otherwise it allows sending types that should never be sent across threads such as Rc or references to cells. You can see an example of such a data-race with cells below:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use signal_simple::channel::SyncChannel;

use std::cell::Cell;
use crossbeam_utils::thread;

// A simple tagged union used to demonstrate problems with data races in Cell.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum RefOrInt { Ref(&'static u64), Int(u64) }
static SOME_INT: u64 = 123;

fn main() {
    let cell = Cell::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));

    let channel = SyncChannel::new();
    channel.send(&cell);

    thread::scope(|s| {
        s.spawn(|_| {
            let smuggled_cell = channel.recv().unwrap();
            loop {
                // Repeatedly write Ref(&addr) and Int(0xdeadbeef) into the cell.
                smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
                smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
            }
        });

        loop {
            if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = cell.get() {
                // Hope that between the time we pattern match the object as a
                // `Ref`, it gets written to by the other thread.
                if addr as *const u64 == &SOME_INT as *const u64 { continue; }

                println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
                println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
            }
        }
    });
}
```

which outputs:

```
Pointer is now: 0xdeadbeef

Return Code: -11 (SIGSEGV)

```

## Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for SyncChannel. SyncChannel doesn't provide access to &T but merely serves as a channel that consumes and returns owned T.

Users can create UB in safe Rust by sending T: !Send to other threads with SyncChannel::send/recv APIs. Using T = Arc<Cell<\_> allows to create data races (which can lead to memory corruption), and using T = MutexGuard allows to unlock a mutex from a thread that didn't lock the mutex.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Package

cargo

signal-simple
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

<= 0.1.1

## Patched versions

None

## Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `SyncChannel<T>`. `SyncChannel<T>` doesn't provide access to `&T` but merely serves as a channel that consumes and returns owned `T`. Users can create UB in safe Rust by sending `T: !Send` to other threads with `SyncChannel::send/recv` APIs. Using `T = Arc<Cell<_>` allows to create data races (which can lead to memory corruption), and using `T = MutexGuard<T>` allows to unlock a mutex from a thread that didn't lock the mutex.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
