Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36449:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `ShmWriter` struct in the `kekbit` crate implemented the `Send` trait without requiring its generic type parameter `H` to also implement `Send`. This allowed instances of `ShmWriter` to be sent across threads, even when the type `H` within it was not thread-safe, leading to potential data races.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect `Send` implementation:** The `ShmWriter` struct incorrectly implemented `Send` trait unconditionally, which allowed non-Send types to be moved across threads.
- **Data races:** Sending a non-Send type across threads through `ShmWriter` could lead to data races and undefined behavior due to lack of thread safety.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Undefined Behavior:** The main impact is the potential for undefined behavior due to data races and memory corruption that arises when non-Send types are accessed from multiple threads simultaneously.
- **Memory corruption:** The vulnerability could lead to memory corruption due to race conditions
- **Panic:** The example code provided in the issue demonstrates how a non-Send type can cause a panic when its destructor is called on a different thread than where it was created, which demonstrates the potential to trigger an abnormal program termination.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a `ShmWriter` instance, which contains a non-`Send` type, across threads by using Rust's standard threading mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a program using the vulnerable `kekbit` crate.
- The attacker must be able to create and send a `ShmWriter` instance containing a non-Send type to another thread.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided issue on GitHub (motoras/kekbit#34) contains a detailed explanation and example code that demonstrates the vulnerability.
- The fix for the vulnerability involves adding a `H: Send` bound to the `Send` implementation of `ShmWriter` or to the `Handler` trait itself to ensure that only thread-safe types can be used with `ShmWriter`.
- The vulnerability is classified as High severity by both the GitHub Advisory Database and rustsec.org
- The CVSS score is 8.1 with vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating a network attack vector, high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, and high attack complexity.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.3.4 of the `kekbit` crate.
