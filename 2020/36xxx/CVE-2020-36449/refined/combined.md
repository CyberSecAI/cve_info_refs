Hello fellow Rustacean,

we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) found a memory-safety/soundness issue in this crate while scanning Rust code on crates.io for potential vulnerabilities.

## Issue Description

[kekbit/src/core/writer.rs](https://github.com/motoras/kekbit/blob/00fc665e2724f07a1aa5ce0f120aa8f75323f614/src/core/writer.rs#L82)

|  | unsafe impl<H: Handler> Send for ShmWriter<H> {} |
| --- | --- |

`ShmWriter` implements `Send` trait regardless of the inner type parameter `H`. This definition allows safe Rust code to send non-Send type across threads, which potentially causes a data race or undefined behavior.

`H: Send` trait bound should probably be added to `ShmWriter`'s `Send` implementation. If all handlers are expected to be `Send`, then `Send` bound can be added to `Handler` trait's definition instead.

## Reproduction

Below is an example program that shows non-Send type can be sent across threads using safe APIs of `kekbit`.

Show Detail
```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use std::marker::PhantomData;
use std::thread;

use kekbit::api::Handler;
use kekbit::core::{shm_writer, Metadata, TickUnit::Nanos};

// non-Send type that panics when dropped in a wrong thread
struct NonSend {
    created_thread: thread::ThreadId,
    // Ensure `NonSend` type does not implement `Send` trait
    _marker: PhantomData<*mut ()>,
}

impl NonSend {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        NonSend {
            created_thread: thread::current().id(),
            _marker: PhantomData,
        }
    }
}

impl Drop for NonSend {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        if thread::current().id() != self.created_thread {
            panic!("NonSend destructor is running on a wrong thread!");
        }
    }
}

impl Handler for NonSend {}

fn main() {
    // Example code from: https://docs.rs/kekbit/0.3.3/kekbit/core/fn.shm_writer.html#examples
    const FOREVER: u64 = 99_999_999_999;
    let writer_id = 1850;
    let channel_id = 42;
    let capacity = 3000;
    let max_msg_len = 100;
    let metadata = Metadata::new(writer_id, channel_id, capacity, max_msg_len, FOREVER, Nanos);
    let test_tmp_dir = tempdir::TempDir::new("kekbit").unwrap();

    let writer = shm_writer(&test_tmp_dir.path(), &metadata, NonSend::new()).unwrap();

    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        // `NonSend` is sent to another thread via `ShmWriter`
        drop(writer);
    });

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

Output:

```
thread '<unnamed>' panicked at 'NonSend destructor is running on a wrong thread!', src/main.rs:44:13
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Any', src/main.rs:68:19

Return code 101

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
