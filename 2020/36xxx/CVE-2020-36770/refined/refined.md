```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The `pkg_postinst` function in the slurm ebuild uses `chown -R` to change the ownership of directories created by the package. This allows a malicious user to create hard links to sensitive files and have their ownership changed to the `slurm` user upon package reinstallation or upgrade, effectively leading to a privilege escalation.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Incorrect use of `chown -R` in `pkg_postinst` on directories that can be manipulated by the `slurm` user through hard or symbolic links.
- Package maintainer scripts are creating directories and setting permissions instead of leveraging the package manager.

Impact of exploitation:
- Privilege escalation to root by gaining control of critical files, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- Modification or deletion of critical system files.

Attack vectors:
- A local user with the privileges of the `slurm` user creates a hard link in one of the directories targeted by the vulnerable `chown -R` command, pointing to a root-owned file.
- The vulnerable code is executed when the slurm package is reinstalled or upgraded using the `emerge` command.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Must have the ability to execute commands as the `slurm` user to create the hard links prior to package reinstallation or upgrade.
