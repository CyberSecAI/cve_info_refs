    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2020-36166",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The InfoScale application loads the OpenSSL library from \\usr\\local\\ssl and attempts to load the \\usr\\local\\ssl\\openssl.cnf configuration file. On Windows, a low-privileged user can create the <drive>:\\usr\\local\\ssl\\openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure library loading, uncontrolled search path.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM, leading to administrator access.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker creates a malicious OpenSSL configuration file in a predictable path.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Low-privileged user on the Windows system without any privileges in InfoScale."
