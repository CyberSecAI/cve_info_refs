Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of capability checks in the `qppr_save_quick_redirect_ajax` and `qppr_delete_quick_redirect` functions of the WordPress Quick Page/Post Redirect plugin. These functions are intended for saving and deleting redirect configurations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper authorization checks. These AJAX functions should only be accessible to users with the appropriate privileges (e.g., administrators). However, they can be accessed by lower-privileged authenticated users (e.g., contributors).
*   **Security Nonce Bypass:** Although the functions use a security nonce for protection, this nonce is exposed in the HTML source code of certain WordPress admin pages (e.g., `edit.php`, `post.php`, `post-new.php`) which are accessible to lower-privileged users. This allows attackers to retrieve the nonce and use it to make unauthorized requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Redirect Creation:** Attackers can create or modify redirect rules in the plugin settings. This can be exploited to redirect users to malicious external websites, potentially for phishing or malware distribution.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could potentially redirect all traffic from the website.
*   **Plugin Settings Modification:** Attackers can change plugin settings using the `qppr_save_quick_redirect_ajax` and also delete redirects using the `qppr_delete_quick_redirect` function.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is network-based (remote) and uses HTTP requests.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable WordPress site with low privileges (e.g., a contributor role or above).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:**  The attacker needs to be a registered user on the WordPress site.
*   **Access to Admin Pages:** The attacker needs access to the admin interface to fetch the security nonce, which can be obtained from pages accessible by lower-privileged users.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send malicious requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The plugin is no longer maintained, and the vulnerability has not been fixed by the vendor.
*   The vulnerability affects versions 5.1.9 and earlier of the Quick Page/Post Redirect plugin.
*   The `qppr_save_quick_redirect_ajax` function saves the redirect settings in the `wp_options` table.
*   The redirection is performed using the `Location` header.
*   The vulnerable code is present in the `quick-pagepost-redirect-plugin/page_post_redirect_plugin.php` file.
