- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in multiple parameters (`filename`, `mid`, `userid`, `templet`) before including them in the HTML output.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in DedeCMS v5.7 SP2.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent redirects to malicious sources, and manipulation of affected application modules.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can inject malicious script codes through GET requests to vulnerable parameters in the specified files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or user accounts and needs low user interaction.
