- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Veritas VRP/NetBackup Resiliency Platform service on Windows attempts to load the `openssl.cnf` configuration file, which does not exist by default. This can be exploited to load a malicious OpenSSL engine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled search path for configuration file, insecure file system permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges. This allows the attacker to gain complete control of the system, access all data, and installed applications.
- **Attack vectors**: A low-privileged user can create a directory structure `C:\usr\local\ssl\` and place a malicious `openssl.cnf` file. When the service starts, it attempts to load this file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a low-privileged account on the Windows system where the vulnerable software is running. The attacker does not require any specific permissions within the VRP/NetBackup Resiliency Platform itself.
