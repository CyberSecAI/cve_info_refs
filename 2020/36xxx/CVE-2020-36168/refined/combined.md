## Summary

As part of our ongoing testing process Veritas has discovered an issue where Veritas
VRP/NetBackup Resiliency Platform could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code with administrator
privilege.

## Issue

CVE ID: [CVE-2020-36168](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36168)

Severity: Critical

CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.3 ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1))

VRP/NetBackup Resiliency Platform leverages OpenSSL on Windows systems when using the
Managed Host addon.
On start-up, the VRP/NetBackup Resiliency Platform service loads the OpenSSL library. This library
may attempt to load the openssl.cnf configuration file which does not exist. By default, on Windows
systems, users can create directories under C:\. A low privileged user on the Windows system without
any privileges in VRP/NetBackup Resiliency Platform can create a C:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf
configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine resulting in arbitrary code execution as
SYSTEM when the service starts. This gives the attacker administrator access on the system, allowing
the attacker (by default) to access all data, to access all installed applications, etc.

This vulnerability affects VRP/NetBackup Resiliency Platform.

## Affected Versions

VRP/NetBackup Resiliency Platform versions 3.4 and 3.5 are affected. Earlier unsupported
versions may be affected as well.

## Remediation

Customers under a current maintenance contract can download and install VRP/NetBackup
Resiliency Platform v3.6 when available in January 2021 or apply a patch for v3.4 or v3.5. to fix
the vulnerability.

See the Veritas Download Center for available updates: <https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/downloads>

## Mitigation

If not using VRP/NetBackup Resiliency Platform v3.6 or patched versions of 3.4 or 3.5
then using an administrator account create the directory ‘\usr\local\ssl’ under root of all drives
and set the ACL on the directory to deny write access to all other users. This will prevent an
attacker from installing a malicious OpenSSL engine.
