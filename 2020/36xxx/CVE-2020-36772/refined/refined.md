Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient restriction of file paths supplied to the `sendmail` proxy command within CloudLinux CageFS. Specifically, the `-bi` and `-oA` arguments of `sendmail` were not properly validated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **External Control of File Name or Path:** The vulnerability allows a local user to control the file paths used by the `sendmail` command.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The CageFS proxy command implementation lacks proper validation of `sendmail` arguments, especially the `-bi` and `-oA` options.
*   **Argument Injection:** When using Postfix compatibility interface, additional arguments can be injected into the `postalias` command through the `-oA` option, which is not a security issue in Postfix itself.
*   **Reliance on System Security:** Postfix's `sendmail` relies on the underlying operating system to enforce access policies based on user/group IDs instead of sanitizing command-line arguments.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** A local user within a CageFS environment can read arbitrary files outside of the CageFS environment, potentially disclosing sensitive information by using `sendmail` with specific lookup table types (like `texthash` or `unix`).
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** A local user can write to arbitrary files outside of the CageFS environment using `sendmail` with specific lookup table types like `hash`, allowing for the creation or modification of files.
*  **Information Disclosure:** The verbose mode of `sendmail` which is enabled by  `-v` parameter if used at least twice can leak Postfix configurations.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to a system with CloudLinux CageFS installed and vulnerable.
*   **Exploiting `sendmail` Proxy Command:** The attacker leverages the ability to execute the `sendmail` command as a proxy command outside the CageFS environment.
*  **Manipulating `sendmail` arguments:** Specifically the attacker has to use the `-bi` and `-oA` parameters to inject malicious file paths and options.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a local user account that is restricted by CageFS.
*   **Ability to Execute Commands:** The attacker needs to be able to execute commands, particularly `sendmail`, through the CageFS proxy command mechanism.
*  **Understanding of Sendmail and Postfix:** Understanding of `sendmail` command line options and Postfix's alias database mechanisms helps in crafting exploits.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in CloudLinux CageFS versions 7.0.8-2 and below.
*   It is fixed in version 7.1.1-1.
*   The `-oA` parameter is dangerous as it allows specifying multiple paths and additional arguments directly after the option without separators.
*   The `-bi` parameter enables the `newalias` mode of `sendmail`.
* The `-v` parameter if used at least twice enables verbose mode leaking postfix config.
* The vulnerability was identified on 2020-07-07 and publicly disclosed on 2024-01-25 after the CVE was assigned.
* The fix for this issue was introduced in `cagefs-7.1.1-1`.
