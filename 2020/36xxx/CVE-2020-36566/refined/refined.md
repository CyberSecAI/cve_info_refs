Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-36566:

**Root Cause:**

*   Improper path sanitization within the `tar-utils` library when handling file paths within tar archives. Specifically, the library did not properly validate paths, allowing for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The core vulnerability is a path traversal issue, where a crafted archive can contain file paths with ".." sequences, allowing files to be written (or overwritten) outside the intended target directory during extraction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite existing files on the system, potentially including executable files.
*   **Remote Command Execution:** By overwriting executable files, an attacker can achieve remote command execution either immediately or when a legitimate user or the system executes the modified file.
*   **Configuration Manipulation:** Overwriting configuration files or other sensitive resources can also cause damage or lead to further exploitation.
*   **Impact on both Client and Server:** The vulnerability can be exploited on both client (user) machines and servers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Archive:** The attacker crafts a malicious tar archive containing relative file paths (e.g., `../../../evil.sh`).
*   **Extraction Process:** The vulnerability is triggered during the extraction of the malicious archive using the vulnerable `tar-utils` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a tar archive:** The attacker needs to be able to create and control the content of a tar archive.
*   **Delivery of malicious archive:** The attacker needs to deliver or have the malicious archive processed by an application using the vulnerable `tar-utils` library. No user interaction is required besides the archive being extracted.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is similar to the "Zip Slip" vulnerability, which affects various archive formats.
*   The fix involves proper sanitization of file paths before writing files during extraction, specifically preventing ".." sequences from being processed.
*   The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** with a CVSS v3 base score of **9.1**.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of `github.com/whyrusleeping/tar-utils` prior to `0.0.0-20201201191210-20a61371de5b`.
