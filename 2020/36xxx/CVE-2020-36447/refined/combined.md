## Affected versions

< 0.1.43

## Patched versions

0.1.43

## Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Sync for SyncRef. This definition allows data races if &T is accessible through &SyncRef.

SyncRef derives Clone and Debug, and the default implementations of those traits access &T by invoking T::clone() & T::fmt(). It is possible to create data races & undefined behavior by concurrently invoking SyncRef::clone() or SyncRef::fmt() from multiple threads with T: !Sync.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
