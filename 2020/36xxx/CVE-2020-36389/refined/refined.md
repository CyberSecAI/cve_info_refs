Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36389:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The CiviCRM CKEditor configuration form lacks proper CSRF protection. The `run()` method does not validate CSRF tokens, allowing an attacker to make unauthorized changes to the CKEditor configuration via a crafted form.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary weakness is the absence of CSRF tokens, which allows attackers to make requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
*   **Stored XSS:**  By exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker can modify the CKEditor configuration to include malicious JavaScript, leading to stored XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the CKEditor configuration, leading to XSS. This could allow for various malicious actions like session hijacking, data theft, and further exploitation.
*   **Privilege escalation:** By combining the stored XSS with a separate Phar Deserialization vulnerability, an attacker could achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious website:** An attacker could lure an authenticated administrator to a malicious website containing a crafted form that makes unauthorized requests to the CiviCRM instance.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers could also use phishing emails to trick administrators into visiting malicious pages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network or have direct access to the CiviCRM server.
*   **Targeted administrator:** The attacker needs to target an authenticated administrator of the CiviCRM instance, who has the ability to modify the CKEditor configuration.
*   **Social engineering:** The attacker needs to use some social engineering to convince the administrator to access the malicious page or submit the malicious form.

**Additional notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in CiviCRM version 5.28.0 and earlier, fixed in versions 5.28.1 and 5.27.5 ESR.
*   The article mentions a second vulnerability,  a Phar Deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2020-36388), which can be chained with the CSRF/XSS for complete takeover.
*   The attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript by exploiting the `config` post parameter, skipping the sanitation process by not using the "config_" prefix.
*   The injected javascript is saved in a file with a partial attacker-controlled filename in a predetermined path, which limits path traversal.
