Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3285-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                       Guilhem Moulin

Package        : libapache-session-browseable-perl
Version        : 1.3.0-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-36659

In Apache::Session::Browseable before 1.3.6, validity of the X.509
certificate is not checked by default when connecting to remote LDAP
backends, because the default configuration of the Net::LDAPS module for
Perl is used.

This update changes the default behavior to require X.509 validation
against the distribution bundle /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt.
Previous behavior can reverted by setting `ldapVerify => "none"` when
initializing the Apache::Session::Browseable::LDAP object.

NOTE: this update is a prerequisite for LemonLDAP::NG's CVE-2020-16093
fix when its session backend is set to Apache::Session::Browseable::LDAP.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1.3.0-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache-session-browseable-perl packages.

For the detailed security status of libapache-session-browseable-perl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libapache-session-browseable-perl>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
