Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36659:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the fact that `Apache::Session::Browseable` before version 1.3.6 does not perform X.509 certificate validation by default when connecting to remote LDAP backends. This is due to the default behavior of the underlying `Net::LDAPS` module in Perl.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of default X.509 certificate validation during LDAP connections. This allows a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to potentially intercept or modify communication between the application and the LDAP server by presenting a forged certificate.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to the following:
   - Interception of sensitive information transmitted to the LDAP server, including user credentials and session data
   - Potential modification of data within the LDAP server
   - Full compromise of the application's authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Attack vectors:**
A network attacker positioned between the application and the LDAP server can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to intercept the network traffic and impersonate the LDAP server by presenting a malicious certificate.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs:
  - To be on the network path between the application server and the LDAP server
  - The ability to intercept the network traffic
  - The ability to generate and present a forged X.509 certificate that the client would accept, given that there's no default verification enabled.

The Debian security advisory (DLA 3285-1) provides more detail than the original CVE description, which is a placeholder. It specifies that the fix changes the default behavior to require X.509 validation using the system's CA certificates bundle. It also mentions that the previous behavior can be reverted by setting `ldapVerify => "none"` when initializing the `Apache::Session::Browseable::LDAP` object. This advisory also notes that the fix is a prerequisite for LemonLDAP::NG's CVE-2020-16093 fix when its session backend is set to `Apache::Session::Browseable::LDAP`.
