  "CVE-2020-36726": {
    "description": "The Ultimate Reviews plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 2.1.32 via deserialization of untrusted input in several vulnerable functions. This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The plugin deserializes untrusted data from cookies using the `unserialize()` function without proper sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure deserialization",
        "PHP Object Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "Unauthenticated attackers can inject arbitrary PHP objects which could lead to remote code execution or other malicious behavior, depending on available classes and existing POP chains (although no POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin itself).",
      "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious serialized PHP object and setting it as the value of the `EWD_URP_Karma_IDs` or `EWD_URP_Reviewed_Products` cookie.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They can inject objects by interacting with the site, such as by submitting a review or triggering the AJAX karma update functionality."
