Bug Fix | YES

Original Pull Request | [418sec#1](https://github.com/418sec/nodeserver/pull/1)

Vulnerability README | <https://github.com/418sec/huntr/blob/master/bounties/npm/web-node-server/1/README.md>

### User Comments:

#### Bounty URL: <https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/1-npm-web-node-server>

### ⚙️ Description \*

The `nodeserver` server was vulnerable against `path traversal` through the `../` technique, leading to `information exposure` and `file content disclosure`.

### 💻 Technical Description \*

I implemented a simple `fix` which makes possible sanitizing any occurrence of `../`and different vectors, using a regex, in order to check and avoid bypasses `OS-based` which are really common nowadays.

I didn't add other `pages` for forbidden message, since when a file is sanitized and `not found`, by design the server will reply with the `index.html` file.

### 🐛 Proof of Concept (PoC) \*

1. Download the original server
2. Create the file `test.js` with the following content:

```
var config = {
    'localhost': {
        backend: __dirname + '/',
        frondend: __dirname + '/',
        baseTemp: 'index.html'
    }
};
var pkg = require('./nodeserver/nodeserver');
pkg.start(config);
```

1. Start the server: `node test.js`
2. PoC: `curl --path-as-is http://localhost:9999/../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
3. Content of `/etc/passwd` is showed 😄

### 🔥 Proof of Fix (PoF) \*

Same steps above with fixed version == no `/etc/passwd` showed 😄

[![Screenshot from 2020-08-22 01-10-38](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33063403/90942306-85e45000-e415-11ea-8a6e-e8d75f3e8f76.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33063403/90942306-85e45000-e415-11ea-8a6e-e8d75f3e8f76.png)

### 👍 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

All OK 😄

Sorry, something went wrong.
