Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36647:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability in the `nginx.conf` configuration of the `transmission_ynh` application. The original configuration allowed access to the `/home/yunohost.transmission/completed/` directory, potentially allowing access to files outside of the intended scope.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path Traversal: The primary vulnerability is path traversal. By manipulating the URL, an attacker could potentially access files in the `/home/yunohost.transmission/completed/` directory.
- Insecure `alias` directive: The `alias` directive in the original `nginx.conf` was not properly configured to prevent traversal attacks

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Access: A successful path traversal exploit could allow an attacker to access files within the `/home/yunohost.transmission/completed/` directory, which may include sensitive data.
- Information Disclosure: Depending on the content of the accessed files, the attacker could gain sensitive information about the application or the system it is running on.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously Crafted URL: An attacker could craft a URL with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to navigate outside of the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker would need network access to the application.
- Knowledge of the application's URL structure: The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The commit `f136dfd44eda128129e5fd2d850a3a3c600e6a4a` addresses the path traversal issue by modifying the `nginx.conf` file. The change is from `location __PATH__/downloads/ {` to `location __PATH__/downloads {`. The removal of the trailing `/` prevents path traversal.
- The pull request #75 `Update nginx.conf to protect against path traversal issue` is the actual fix for the vulnerability.
- The pull request description mentions that an upcoming change in the `package_linter` will trigger a "real" error for path traversal issues, suggesting that the vulnerability was previously flagged as a warning, but will now be considered more critical.
- There is a mention of the app being downgraded to level 4 if the vulnerability is not fixed which suggests the criticality of the issue.
