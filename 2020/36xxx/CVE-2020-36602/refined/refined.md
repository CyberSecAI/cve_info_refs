Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-36602:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of messages received by the affected Huawei headset products. Specifically, crafted malformed messages with specific parameters can trigger the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The insufficient validation allows for reading data beyond the intended memory boundaries.
*  **Out-of-bounds Write:** The insufficient validation also permits writing data outside the allocated memory space.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can cause out-of-bounds read and write by exploiting this vulnerability. This could lead to unpredictable behavior, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution. (Although the advisory only mentions the out-of-bounds read and write, the nature of this type of vulnerability could potentially lead to code execution).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the vulnerable headset device.
*   **Malicious Messages:** The attacker must craft and send malformed messages with specific parameters to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical access to the vulnerable device to send the crafted messages.

**Additional Information:**
*   **Affected Products:** A specific list of Huawei headset models and versions is provided, along with the resolved versions.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a base score of 7.1 (AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H) and a temporal score of 6.6 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C), indicating a high severity and exploitability.
*   **Resolution:** The vulnerability is resolved in the "CM-H-Shark-BD 1.0.0.612" firmware version for the affected headsets.
*   **Reported By:** Wen Guanxing reported the vulnerability to Huawei PSIRT.
