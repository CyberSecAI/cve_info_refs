Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36406:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-buffer-overflow in the `uWS::TopicTree::trimTree` function. It arises due to an integer overflow, specifically within the `publish` function of the `TopicTree` class. The code tracks triggered topics with a fixed-size array (64 elements). When more than 64 topics are triggered, the code attempts to drain the topics. However, the draining is called *after* the fixed-size array is overflowed leading to the overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `triggeredTopics` array, which stores pointers to triggered topics, is a fixed-size buffer on the stack. The code does not properly check if the array is full before adding more triggered topics.
- **Integer overflow:** The `numTriggeredTopics` variable is incremented without a check, leading to an overflow when the count exceeds the fixed size limit, causing an out of bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The overflow can cause a program crash due to memory corruption.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** In certain circumstances, a stack-based buffer overflow can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite return addresses and execute malicious code, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided details.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering a large number of topics could cause the overflow. Specifically, it involves publishing or subscribing to a large number of topics to exceed the `triggeredTopics` buffer's limit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the capability to publish/subscribe to topics in such a way that they can trigger more than 64 topics within the vulnerable function. This likely means the attacker needs to be able to interact with the `TopicTree` object via a WebSocket connection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit `03fca626a95130ab80f86adada54b29d27242759` fixes this vulnerability by adding checks to drain the triggered topics before the array overflows.
- The affected versions are `v18.11.0` and `v18.12.0`.
