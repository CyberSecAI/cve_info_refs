- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure command formatting in `aaptjs/index.js` where user input is directly used in the `exec` command without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to the ability to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Execution of arbitrary code on the server.
    - Potential information disclosure by accessing sensitive data.
    - Possible Denial of Service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**:  User input is used to construct the command executed by the `exec` function, which can be manipulated to execute malicious commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to influence the input used to create the command passed to `exec`. This could be through a vulnerable API endpoint or through other means that allow user-controlled values to be included in command construction.
