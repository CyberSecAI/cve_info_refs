Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it displayed user-controlled HTML code without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `error` GET parameter was used to display messages, and it did not escape HTML characters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application failed to sanitize user-provided input (specifically the `error` GET parameter) before displaying it in the web page. This allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the page, which will then be executed in the browser of other users who access the page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **JavaScript execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code, potentially leading to:
    - **User Impersonation:** Stealing session cookies or authentication tokens, allowing the attacker to impersonate a legitimate user.
    - **Data theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data.
    - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or forcing downloads of malicious files.
    - **Defacement:** Altering the visual appearance of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- **GET parameter injection:** An attacker crafts a URL with a malicious HTML payload within the `error` GET parameter. For example, `/page?error=<script>alert("XSS")</script>`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to influence the `error` GET parameter's value, typically by crafting a malicious link or through some other means that allows user-supplied data to reach this parameter.
