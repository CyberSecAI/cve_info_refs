Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36208:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `OnceCell` type in the `conquer-once` crate incorrectly implemented the `Sync` trait without requiring the contained type `T` to also be `Send`. This allowed non-`Send` types, like `MutexGuard`, which are `Sync`, to be used with `OnceCell` and thus be moved across threads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect `Sync` Implementation:** The `Sync` trait was implemented without a `Send` bound on the type parameter `T` of `OnceCell`.
- **Thread-Safety Violation:**  By allowing non-`Send` types to be shared across threads, the code could violate Rust's thread safety guarantees.
- **Data Races:** Moving a non-`Send` type across threads without proper synchronization could lead to data races.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Undefined Behavior:** The primary impact is undefined behavior, which can manifest in unpredictable ways.
- **Memory Corruption:** Specifically, the issue could cause memory corruption due to improper unlocking of mutexes.
- **Concurrency Issues:**  It leads to incorrect behavior in concurrent programs, making them unreliable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable locally.
- It can be triggered through the normal usage of the `OnceCell` type within a multithreaded application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to control the types used with `OnceCell` and the threads in which it is being used, typically in a multithreaded Rust program.
- They don't need special privileges, only the ability to compile and run the affected code with multiple threads.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is demonstrated by the provided proof-of-concept code, which uses `OnceCell` to move a `MutexGuard` across thread boundaries. This is problematic because `MutexGuard` is `Sync` but not `Send`. When the `MutexGuard` is dropped in the parent thread, it attempts to unlock a mutex it did not lock, resulting in undefined behavior.

**Fix:**
The fix involves adding a `Send` bound to the type parameter `T` in the `Sync` implementation for `OnceCell`:
```rust
unsafe impl<T, B> Sync for OnceCell<T, B> where T: Send + Sync {}
```
This ensures that only types that are safe to send between threads can be used with `OnceCell`, preventing the undefined behavior.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by a group scanning Rust code on crates.io.
- The severity is rated as high, with a CVSS score of 7.8.
- The affected versions are those before 0.3.2.
- This vulnerability is also tracked as RUSTSEC-2020-0101 and GHSA-3jc5-5hc5-33gj.
