## Description

![@JOE1994](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10286488?u=b10074df08a0e21e9483938c26612ad8e9dfec4b&v=4&size=48)[JOE1994](https://github.com/JOE1994)opened [on Dec 23, 2020](https://github.com/oliver-giersch/conquer-once/issues/3#issue-773334518)

Hello ü¶Ä ,

we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) found an undefined-behavior issue in this crate while scanning Rust code on crates.io for potential vulnerabilities.

## `Sync` impl of `OnceCell`

By exploiting the fact that `T` has no `Send` bound,

it is possible to make `OnceCell` send a non-Send object across thread boundaries.

```
unsafe impl<T, B> Sync for OnceCell<T, B> where T: Sync {}
```
## Proof of Concept

I prepared a small example that sends `std::sync::MutexGuard` across thread boundaries using `OnceCell`.

```
use conquer_once::OnceCell;
use crossbeam_utils::thread;

use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let once_cell = OnceCell::uninit();
    thread::scope(|s| {
        s.spawn(|_| {
            once_cell.try_init_once(move || {
                let mutex_static = Box::leak(Box::new(Mutex::new(0_i32)));

                // `MutexGuard`is `Sync`, but not `Send`.
                let mutex_guard = mutex_static.lock().unwrap();
                let tid = std::thread::current().id();
                (mutex_guard, tid)
            }).unwrap();
        });
    }).unwrap();

    if let Some((smuggled_mutexguard, tid)) = once_cell.into_inner() {
        // `smuggled_mutexguard` is dropped at the end of its lexical scope.
        // The parent thread attempt to unlock the Mutex which it did not lock.
        //
        // If a thread attempts to unlock a Mutex that it has not locked, it can result in undefined behavior.
        // (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/23465#issuecomment-82730326)
        assert_eq!(tid, std::thread::current().id());
    }
}
```
## Suggested Fix

Adding a `Send` bound to `T` as following will allow the compiler to revoke the example program above.

```
unsafe impl<T, B> Sync for OnceCell<T, B> where T: Send + Sync {}
```

Thank you for checking out this issue üëç

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
