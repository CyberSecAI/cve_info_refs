- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `ViewWorkflowSchemes.jspa` and `ListWorkflows.jspa` endpoints.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the web page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, phishing, or defacement of the web application.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can inject malicious code via the vulnerable `ViewWorkflowSchemes.jspa` and `ListWorkflows.jspa` endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoints. This requires network access to the Jira server.
