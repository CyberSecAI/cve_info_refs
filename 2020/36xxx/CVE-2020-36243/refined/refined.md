Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36243:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input within the OpenEMR application when constructing system commands for database backups. Specifically, the application uses `mysqli_real_escape_string` which is designed for SQL injection protection but is inadequate for preventing command injection. The code uses `echo` with double quotes, allowing command substitution via backticks or `$()`, which are not escaped by `mysqli_real_escape_string`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can inject arbitrary system commands by using backticks within the `form_sel_layouts` POST parameter. The `add_escape_custom()` function (which uses `mysqli_real_escape_string()`) only escapes SQL injection characters, not characters used for shell command substitution in Linux.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The reliance on `mysqli_real_escape_string()` for sanitizing shell command parameters indicates a lack of awareness about command injection attack vectors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary System Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server. This means an attacker can take full control of the server.
*   **Data Breach and Infrastructure Compromise:** This can lead to the compromise of sensitive patient data stored within OpenEMR, and it can also lead to a compromise of the underlying server infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `interface/main/backup.php` file with malicious payload within the `form_sel_layouts` parameter.
*   **Administrator Privilege:**  Initially, exploitation requires the attacker to be logged in as an administrator to access the backup feature. However, this can be chained with other vulnerabilities (XSS and insecure API permissions) for a pre-auth attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Initial Administrator Access:**  Direct exploitation requires an attacker to have valid administrator access. However, the blog post details how this can be bypassed.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable file path (`interface/main/backup.php`) and the vulnerable POST parameter (`form_sel_layouts`).
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to craft payloads containing backticks (``) to execute system commands.

**Additional details from the content:**

* The blog post provides a detailed technical analysis of the vulnerability, including code snippets.
* It outlines a full attack chain, combining command injection with XSS and insecure API permissions, to achieve pre-authentication command execution.
* The blog suggests a fix to the command injection vulnerability is to swap the single and double quotes to prevent command substitution.
* The vulnerability was discovered by SonarSource and reported to the OpenEMR team.
* The OpenEMR team released a patch to address this vulnerability (and others).
