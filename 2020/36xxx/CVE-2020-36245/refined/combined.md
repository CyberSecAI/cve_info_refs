## Description

![@n0kovo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16690056?u=44ac9a8ac298470ac5a2e7f8aac736895c3900e1&v=4&size=48)[n0kovo](https://github.com/n0kovo)opened [on Dec 8, 2020](https://github.com/GramAddict/bot/issues/134#issue-759345639)

I discovered something very concerning just now.

When using [uiautomator2](https://github.com/openatx/uiautomator2), which is what GramAddict is based around, it silently installs the application [ATX-Agent](https://github.com/openatx/atx-agent) on your device, which opens a webserver on TCP port 7912, that lets anyone on the network, with **ZERO** form of authentication, execute code, install apps, exfiltrate private data etc. on your device and view the screen remotely.

As soon as you're running GramAddict, this webserver is started. This is a ***HUGE security concern***, and should be addressed immediately!

Try it yourself:

1. Find the Wi-Fi IP address of your device:

   `adb shell ip route | awk '{print $9}'`

   (NOTE: It is trivial for anyone on the same network to discover your device and the running webserver)
2. Run GramAddict as ususal.
3. Using another device on the same network, go to `http://[PHONE IP]:7912` in your browser.

This is what you're presented with:

(Not showing the API page, as it exposes too much personal info. You can view its endpoints and capabilities at the ATX Agent page linked above)

This is extremely worrying!
