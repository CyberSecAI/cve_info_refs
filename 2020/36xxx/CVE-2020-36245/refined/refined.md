- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `uiautomator2` library, used by GramAddict, silently installs the `ATX-Agent` application on the user's device. This agent opens a web server on TCP port 7912 without any authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of authentication on the web server allows anyone on the same network to access the device. This exposes the device to unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can execute code, install apps, exfiltrate private data, and view the device screen remotely without any authentication. This allows for complete control over the device.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker needs to be on the same network as the device running GramAddict and access the webserver on port 7912. The device IP address is easily discoverable via `adb shell ip route | awk '{print $9}'`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device and have basic network knowledge to discover the device and its IP.
