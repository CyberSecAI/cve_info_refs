Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `aom` (AV1 Video Codec Library), specifically a buffer overflow. It is triggered while processing a malformed multimedia file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:**  A buffer overflow can occur while processing a malformed file, which suggests improper bounds checking or allocation of memory during file processing. This can lead to data corruption or overwriting of adjacent memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Unspecified impact:**  The advisory mentions "other unspecified impact" which may include arbitrary code execution, data leaks or unexpected behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malformed Multimedia File:**  The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted multimedia file, which when processed by a vulnerable version of `aom` would trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed media file to the vulnerable software. This could be through a website, email attachment, or other methods that involve processing user-provided files.
*   No specific attacker position is mentioned, implying that this vulnerability could be exploited remotely or locally, depending on the application's architecture.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The Debian Security Advisory DSA-5490-1 and Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3556-1 list this CVE alongside other related vulnerabilities in `aom`.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 202401-32 also references this CVE.
*   The Gentoo advisory explicitly states both "local and remote" exploitability.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in `libaom` version 3.2.0 and later.
*   The Debian packages fixed in version `1.0.0-3+deb10u1` for Debian 10 (buster) and `1.0.0.errata1-3+deb11u1` for Debian oldstable (bullseye) address the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2020-36133 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `aom` library that can be triggered by a malformed media file, potentially leading to denial of service and other unspecified impacts.
