The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in the Demokratian web application, a SQL Injection vulnerability and a Broken Authentication vulnerability.

**SQL Injection**

*   **Root cause:** The `id_provincia` parameter in `basicos_php/genera_select.php` was not properly sanitized, allowing for SQL injection.
*   **Weakness:** Unsanitized user input passed to SQL query
*   **Impact:** An attacker could use SQL injection to extract data from the database, potentially including voter information.
*  **Attack vector:** By manipulating the `id_provincia` GET parameter with malicious SQL code.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** No authentication is required. The attacker only needs to send a crafted HTTP GET request.

**Broken Authentication**

*   **Root cause:** The `install/install3.php` file was not removed after installation, allowing an attacker to create an administrator user.
*   **Weakness:** Improper removal of installation files, leading to a bypass of intended authentication mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** The attacker could gain full control over the application by creating an administrator account.
*   **Attack vector:** By accessing the `install/install3.php` file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** No authentication is required. The attacker only needs to access the vulnerable file.
