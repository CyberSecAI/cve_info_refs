Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36216:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `eventio` crate's `Input<R>` type implementing the `Send` trait without requiring that the type parameter `R` also implement `Send`. This allows instances of `Input<R>` to be sent between threads even when `R` is not thread-safe (i.e., does not implement `Send`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Trait Bound:** The core weakness is the missing `R: Send` bound in the `Send` implementation for `Input<R>`.
*   **Data Race:** This missing bound allows for the possibility of creating data races when a non-`Send` object is accessed concurrently from multiple threads via the `Input<R>` wrapper.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Undefined Behavior:** Sending a non-`Send` type across threads results in undefined behavior.
*   **Data Races:** The primary risk is the introduction of data races which can lead to incorrect program behavior and memory corruption. The provided example demonstrates a data race on a `Cell`, leading to inaccurate statistics.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Data races can potentially lead to memory corruption, though the provided example does not directly show this.
*   **Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a high impact on availability. While data corruption or other undefined behavior may not result in a direct crash, it can lead to unpredictable program state, potentially making the program unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Although the vulnerability is in a library, the CVSS vector indicates "Network" as the attack vector. This is because the vulnerable code could be used in a network application.
*   **Concurrency:** The attack vector requires the exploitation of concurrency, specifically moving the `Input<R>` struct to a separate thread, which may happen implicitly as part of the library's design.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Execution:** An attacker needs to be able to execute code that makes use of the `eventio` crate and can create a scenario where a non-`Send` type is passed to `Input<R>` and sent to another thread.
*   **Concurrency:** The attacker must be able to trigger concurrent access to the underlying non-Send data by sending the constructed `Input<R>` across threads.
*   **No Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without requiring any special privileges.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided proof of concept clearly demonstrates the vulnerability using a custom `Read` object containing a non-`Send` `Rc<Cell<usize>>` and shows the data race that arises when the counter is updated across multiple threads.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves adding the trait bound `R: Send` to the `Send` implementation for `Input<R>`, which restricts the type parameter `R` to be thread-safe, thus preventing the data race.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9 (Medium), with a high impact on availability.
*   **CWEs:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization) and CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write).
