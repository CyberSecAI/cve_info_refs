### Description

`Input<R>` implements `Send` without requiring `R: Send`.

Affected versions of this crate allows users to send non-Send types to other threads,
which can lead to undefined behavior such as data race and memory corruption.

The flaw was corrected in version 0.5.1 by adding `R: Send` bound to the `Send` impl of `Input<R>`.

## Description

![@JOE1994](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10286488?u=b10074df08a0e21e9483938c26612ad8e9dfec4b&v=4&size=48)[JOE1994](https://github.com/JOE1994)opened [on Dec 20, 2020](https://github.com/petabi/eventio/issues/33#issue-771520508)

Hello 🦀 , we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) found a soundness issue in this crate while scanning Rust code on `crates.io` for potential vulnerabilities.

## Soundness Issue

`Send` is unconditionally implemented for `Input<R>`,

so that it is possible to send `Input<R>` to other threads even when `R` is not `Send`.

```
// location = 'src/pcap.rs:22:1: 22:55'
unsafe impl<R: Read> std::marker::Send for Input<R> {}
```

When `Input<R>` is misused, it is possible to create a data race to a non-`Sync` object.

## Proof of Concept

* The example below program creates a data race to a `Cell` using `Input<R>`
  + modified from <https://docs.rs/eventio/0.5.0/src/eventio/pcap.rs.html#148>
* **Multiple threads concurrently update the same `Cell` that counts the number of `read` events,

  making the `Cell` to contain incorrect statistics.**
* `fn main()` compares the value contained inside `Cell` with the exact number of `read`s that happened.
* `CustomRead` is a `Read` object that contains a non `Send` object (`Rc<Cell<usize>>`)
* Program output is shown after the program below

```
use crossbeam_channel::unbounded;
use eventio::{pcap, Input};
use pcap_parser::{LegacyPcapBlock, PcapHeader, ToVec};
use std::{
    io::{self, Cursor},
    cell::Cell,
    rc::Rc,
    sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering},
    thread,
};

/// Non-Send object implementing `Read` trait.
struct CustomRead {
    read: Cursor<Vec<u8>>,
    non_send_counter: Rc<Cell<usize>>,
    atomic_cnt: bool,
}
impl CustomRead {
    fn new(
        non_send_counter: Rc<Cell<usize>>,
        atomic_cnt: bool,
    ) -> Self {
        CustomRead {
            read: Self::create_pcap(),
            non_send_counter,
            atomic_cnt,
        }
    }
    fn create_pcap() -> Cursor<Vec<u8>> {
        let fake_content = b"fake packet";
        let pkt = LegacyPcapBlock {
            ts_sec: 0,
            ts_usec: 0,
            caplen: fake_content.len() as u32,
            origlen: fake_content.len() as u32,
            data: fake_content,
        }
        .to_vec_raw()
        .unwrap();
        let mut buf = PcapHeader::new().to_vec_raw().unwrap();
        for _ in 0..N_PACKETS {
            buf.extend(pkt.iter());
        }
        Cursor::new(buf)
    }
    fn update_read_cnt(&self) {
        if self.atomic_cnt {
            REAL_CNT.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Release);
        } else {
            self.non_send_counter.set(self.non_send_counter.get() + 1);
        }
    }
}
impl std::io::Read for CustomRead {
    fn read(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> io::Result<usize> {
        // Increment counter to keep track of '# of read events'.
        self.update_read_cnt();
        self.read.read(buf)
    }
}

const N_PACKETS: usize = 9_000_000;
const NTHREADS: usize = 8;
static REAL_CNT: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);
fn experiment(atomic_cnt: bool) -> usize {
    let (data_tx, data_rx) = unbounded();
    let (ack_tx, ack_rx) = unbounded();

    // Non-Sync counter that counts the # of read events that happen within this thread.
    // This counter should only be updated within a single thread.
    // Updating this counter concurrently from multiple threads will result in incorrect counts.
    let read_cnt_in_thread= Rc::new(Cell::new(0_usize));

    let mut children = Vec::with_capacity(NTHREADS);
    for _ in 0..NTHREADS {
        let input = pcap::Input::with_read(
            data_tx.clone(),
            ack_rx.clone(),
            CustomRead::new(Rc::clone(&read_cnt_in_thread), atomic_cnt),
        );
        children.push(thread::spawn(move || {
            // `input` is moved from parent thread to child thread.
            input.run().unwrap()
        }));
    }

    std::mem::drop(data_tx);
    for ev in data_rx.iter() {
        ack_tx.send(ev.seq_no).unwrap();
    }
    std::mem::drop(ack_tx);

    for child in children.into_iter() {
        child.join().unwrap();
    }
    if atomic_cnt {
        REAL_CNT.load(Ordering::Acquire)
    } else {
        read_cnt_in_thread.get()
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Check that `read_cnt_in_thread` maintains incorrect count of events.
    assert_eq!(
        experiment(true),
        experiment(false),
    );
}
```
### Program output

When compiled with `rustc 1.49.0-nightly (release mode)` & run on `Ubuntu 18.04`,

outputs from 3 executions of the program was as below.

```
thread 'main' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
  left: `29688`,
 right: `29672`', examples/eventio.rs:105:5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
thread 'main' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
  left: `29688`,
 right: `29679`', examples/eventio.rs:105:5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
thread 'main' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
  left: `29688`,
 right: `29680`', examples/eventio.rs:105:5

```
## Suggested Solution

Simply adding trait bound `R: Send` to the `Send` impl for `Input<R>` will allow the compiler to revoke programs like the above.

After the change, `Input<R>` can no longer carry non-Send objects when moving across thread boundaries.

```
use std::marker::Send;

unsafe impl<R: Read + Send> Send for Input<R> {}
```

Thank you for very much for checking out this issue 👍
