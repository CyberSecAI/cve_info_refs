# Description

Chunk API does not respect the align requirement of types. Unaligned reference can be created with the API, which is an undefined behavior.

# Demonstration

* Crate: chunky
* Version: 0.3.7
* OS: Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS
* Rust: rustc 1.47.0-nightly (bf4342114 2020-08-25)

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use chunky::{HeapStorage, Ident, Value};
use std::rc::Rc;

#[repr(align(256))]
struct LargeAlign(u8);

impl Drop for LargeAlign {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Dropped");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let ident = Ident(String::from("ident"));
    let storage = Rc::new(HeapStorage);
    let value = Value::load_or_default(ident, LargeAlign(0), storage.clone());

    // Value reference does not have a correct alignment
    let v = &*value as *const _ as usize;
    println!("{:x}", v);
    assert!(v % std::mem::align_of::<LargeAlign>() == 0);

    // https://github.com/aeplay/chunky/blob/ef8533aec961eb5f415414dcd81ec4b395bae177/src/value.rs#L43-L49
    // Another bug that is not UB: `LargeAlign::Drop` is not called due to incorrect `drop_in_place()` in `Value::drop()`.
    // "Dropped" should be printed otherwise.
}
```

Output:

```
555e921bea80
thread 'main' panicked at 'assertion failed: v % std::mem::align_of::<LargeAlign>() == 0', src/main.rs:42:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

```

Return Code: 101

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
