Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36562:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from unchecked type assertions within the `handleRequest()` function in the `krpc.go` file of the `shiyanhui/dht` Go package. Specifically, the code directly asserts that certain values extracted from a bencoded UDP packet are strings without verifying their actual types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unchecked Type Assertions:** The code uses type assertions (e.g., `response["t"].(string)`) without proper checks. If the received data does not conform to the expected type (e.g., an integer instead of a string), a panic will occur.
- **Lack of Error Handling:** The code lacks `recover()` to handle panics from type assertion failures, causing the application to crash instead of gracefully handling the malformed input.
- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** While not explicitly stated as a resource consumption issue, the crash due to a panic effectively leads to denial-of-service by preventing the service from processing requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a maliciously crafted UDP packet with incorrect data types, an attacker can trigger a panic in the `handleRequest()` function, causing the application to crash and become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Attackers can send malicious UDP packets over the network to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server running the vulnerable `shiyanhui/dht` package.
- **Packet Crafting:** The attacker must be able to craft a bencoded UDP packet that contains incorrect data types where strings are expected. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by sending an integer instead of a string in fields like `id` or `t`

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all versions of `github.com/shiyanhui/dht` up to and including `0.0.0-20201219151056-5a20f3199263`.
