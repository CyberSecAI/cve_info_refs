# The Go Language Collective is no longer active.

Collectives™ on Stack Overflow is a new offering in beta release. Currently a Collective requires participation from
a sponsoring organization, so in some cases a Collective may be decommissioned when the sponsorship ends. All questions and
answers that comprised a Collective remain accessible.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@hMihaiDavid](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24855110?v=4&size=48)[hMihaiDavid](https://github.com/hMihaiDavid)opened [on Apr 29, 2020](https://github.com/shiyanhui/dht/issues/57#issue-609371164)

At the begining of `krpc.go:handleRequest()`, several unchecked type assertions are made to the values of the parsed bencoded udp packet.

(line 428) `t := response["t"].(string)`

(line 445) `id := a["id"].(string)`

... and others ...

An illegal packet that contains a bencode integer instead of a string in the `id` field would trigger a panic because the [type assertion is not checked](https://play.golang.org/p/aIBOaPyVmT8) and [recover()](https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover) is not used. Therefore a malicious packet can crash the process.

I don't know how much of a problem this is though.
