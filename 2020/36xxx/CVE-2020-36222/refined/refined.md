RELATED: CVE-2020-36222

The provided documents describe a vulnerability in OpenLDAP, specifically an assertion failure that can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the slapd daemon.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**:
    - The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted packet that causes an assertion failure within the `slap_parse_user` function in `saslauthz.c`, specifically at line 181.
    - The assertion `mech->bv_val == id->bv_val + 2` fails, causing the program to abort.
    - The malformed packet leads to the mechanism value not being parsed correctly, causing the assertion to fail.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Assertion failure due to improper parsing of input data, which can be triggered remotely.
    - Lack of proper input validation allows malicious packets to cause the assertion to fail.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS) due to the slapd daemon crashing.
    - This prevents legitimate users from accessing the LDAP service.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attack vector is a network-based attack. A malicious actor sends a specially crafted packet to the OpenLDAP server.
    - The vulnerable code is located in the `saslauthz.c` file, which handles SASL authorization.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the OpenLDAP server.
    - No authentication is required, making it an unauthenticated remote attack.
