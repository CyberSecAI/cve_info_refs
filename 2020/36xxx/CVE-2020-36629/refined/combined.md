### @huntr-helper **[huntr-helper](/huntr-helper)** commented [Sep 3, 2020](#issue-691828721)

<https://huntr.dev/users/Mik317> has fixed the Path Traversal vulnerability üî®. Mik317 has been awarded $25 for fixing the vulnerability through the huntr bug bounty program üíµ. Think you could fix a vulnerability like this?

Original Pull Request | [418sec#1](https://github.com/418sec/httpster/pull/1)

Vulnerability README | <https://github.com/418sec/huntr/blob/master/bounties/npm/httpster/1/README.md>

### User Comments:

### üìä Metadata \*

#### Bounty URL: <https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/1-npm-httpster>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Description \*

The `httpster` file server was vulnerable against a `path traversal` issue which existed because `symlinks` were fetched and their content served without any warn/error.

### üíª Technical Description \*

I inserted a `new router` inside the `express` server which was created by `httpster` and used `fs.lstat` to check if the requested file is or not a `symlink`.

In case it is and the `--symlink` flag isn't specified by the server (default `false` like in other servers like `Nginx`), an error is thrown.

### üêõ Proof of Concept (PoC) \*

1. Download `httpster`
2. `ln -s /etc/passwd test`
3. `httpster`
4. Go on <http://localhost:3333/test> and the content of the `/etc/passwd` file is shown

[![Screenshot from 2020-08-25 17-23-54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33063403/91204053-d6082e80-e703-11ea-81b8-fb1cfe0a8dee.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33063403/91204053-d6082e80-e703-11ea-81b8-fb1cfe0a8dee.png)

### üî• Proof of Fix (PoF) \*

1. Same steps above, but an error is given instead of the content of the `/etc/passwd` file

[![Screenshot from 2020-08-25 18-34-12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33063403/91204133-e5877780-e703-11ea-8264-006b1b65e227.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33063403/91204133-e5877780-e703-11ea-8264-006b1b65e227.png)

1. Same steps but start the server with `httpster --symlink` and the `/etc/passwd` file is shown (option)

[![Screenshot from 2020-08-25 18-35-29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33063403/91204158-eb7d5880-e703-11ea-9bdc-7caa88723097.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33063403/91204158-eb7d5880-e703-11ea-9bdc-7caa88723097.png)
