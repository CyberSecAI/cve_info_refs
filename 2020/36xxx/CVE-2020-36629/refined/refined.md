The provided content is related to CVE-2020-36629.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `httpster` file server was vulnerable to path traversal because it served the content of symlinks without any warning or error.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The server followed symbolic links when serving files, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, by creating a symbolic link to that file and then accessing it through the `httpster` server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to create a symbolic link within the directory being served by `httpster`.
- The attacker then needs to access that symlink via a web request to the server.
- The server would then serve the content of the linked file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a symlink in the directory served by `httpster`.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Additional details:**
- The fix introduces a check for symbolic links using `fs.lstat`. By default, serving symlinks is disabled. If a symlink is detected, the server will throw an error unless the `--symlink` flag is specified when starting the server.
- The vulnerability was fixed by the addition of a new router inside the express server, using `fs.lstat` to detect symlinks.
- A command-line option `--symlink` was introduced to allow symlink serving, but it is disabled by default.
