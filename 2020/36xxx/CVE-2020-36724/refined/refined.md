Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36724:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a user-supplied hashing algorithm within the `hash_hmac()` function, combined with a loose comparison of the generated hash. This allowed attackers to manipulate the hashing process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Insecure Hash Algorithm Handling:** The plugin used a user-provided algorithm for the `hash_hmac()` function, making it vulnerable to manipulation.
2.  **Loose Comparison:** The plugin employed a loose comparison (e.g., `==` instead of `===`) when verifying the generated hash, which could lead to type juggling and an incorrect match. This allowed attackers to bypass authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass the plugin's authentication mechanism and gain temporary administrative privileges, potentially enabling them to:
*   Publish posts and pages on the WordPress site.
*   Upload media files.
*   Potentially take other actions associated with the admin role.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker sends a crafted request to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Details**
* The vulnerable code is located within the `wordable.php` file of the Wordable plugin.
* The vulnerability was patched in version 3.1.2 by changing the hashing algorithm to 'sha1' and using a strict comparison.
* The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on January 28, 2020.
* The plugin had over 1,000 active installations at the time of disclosure.

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description which is a placeholder, and it provides a solid understanding of the vulnerability.
