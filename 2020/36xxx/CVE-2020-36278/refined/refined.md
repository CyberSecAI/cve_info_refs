Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-36278:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `findNextBorderPixel` function within the `ccbord.c` file of the Leptonica library. The root cause is a lack of boundary checks when searching for the next pixel in an image border, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The code attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer on the heap, which can lead to a crash or potentially enable arbitrary code execution.
*   **Insufficient boundary checks:** The `findNextBorderPixel` function does not adequately check if the calculated pixel coordinates (`npx`, `npy`) are within the image boundaries before accessing the pixel data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a crash by providing a crafted image that triggers the overflow.
*   **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** If an attacker has enough control over the buffer overflow, they could potentially execute arbitrary code on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted image using the affected Leptonica library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to provide input to an application using the vulnerable library. No special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs when the function tries to find the next border pixel in a clockwise direction around the boundary of a connected component.
*   The code calculates new coordinates (`npx`, `npy`) based on a position in a lookup table. These new coordinates are not validated against the image boundaries.
*   The fix, as shown in the commit diff, adds a check to verify if `npx` and `npy` are within the image width and height bounds, respectively.

**Summary of fixes:**
*   The fix to this vulnerability was addressed in leptonica version 1.80.0, and the fix was backported into the distro packages that were vulnerable.
*   The fix added boundary checks in `findNextBorderPixel` function.
