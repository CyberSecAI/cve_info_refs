- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Recursive calls to `parse_block`, `parse_statement`, and `parse_statement_list` functions lead to stack exhaustion. The vulnerability lies in the way the parser handles nested blocks and statements, causing excessive stack usage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow due to unbounded recursion in the parsing logic. Specifically the parsing functions call each other recursively without proper exit condition
- **Impact of exploitation**: Crash due to stack exhaustion, potentially leading to denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted input file/code to the vulnerable parser can trigger the recursive calls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs to be able to provide input code to the vulnerable parser. No specific access or permissions are stated.
