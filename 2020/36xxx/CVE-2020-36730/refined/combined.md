### Description

The CMP for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the cmp\_get\_post\_detail(), niteo\_export\_csv(), and cmp\_disable\_comingsoon\_ajax() functions in versions up to, and including, 3.8.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read posts, export subscriber lists, and/or deactivate the plugin.

# Multiple vulnerabilities fixed in CMP – Coming Soon and Maintenance plugin.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [August 4, 2020 - 2:26pm [+0700]January 21, 2021 - 6:16pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/multiple-vulnerabilities-fixed-in-cmp-coming-soon-and-maintenance-plugin/)

The WordPress [CMP – Coming Soon and Maintenance plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cmp-coming-soon-maintenance/) (100k+ active installations) fixed multiple vulnerabilities. Affected versions are 3.7.9 and below and, to some extend, versions 3.8 and 3.8.1 (see [Timeline](#timeline) below for more details).

All vulnerabilities are related to the AJAX actions found in the “[cmp-coming-soon-maintenance/niteo-cmp.php](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cmp-coming-soon-maintenance/tags/3.7.9/niteo-cmp.php)” script.

### Arbitrary Post Read

The plugin registers the `cmp_get_post_detail` AJAX action and makes it accessible to any user, authenticated or not:

```

94    add_action( 'wp_ajax_cmp_get_post_detail', array( $this, 'cmp_get_post_detail' ) );
95    add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_cmp_get_post_detail', array( $this, 'cmp_get_post_detail' ) );
...
...
2657  public function cmp_get_post_detail() {
2658	   $id = isset($_POST['id']) ? esc_attr($_POST['id']) : '';
2659	   $size = $this->isMobile ? 'large' : 'large';
2660	   wp_send_json( array(
2661	      'img'   => get_the_post_thumbnail( $id, $size ),
2662	      'date'  => get_the_date( 'F j, Y', $id ),
2663	      'title' => get_the_title( $id ),
2664	      'body'  => apply_filters( 'the_content', get_post_field('post_content', $id) ),
2665	      'url'   => get_the_permalink( $id ),
2666	   ));
2667  }

```

The function will display the post whose ID is `$_POST['id']`, regardless of its status : an unauthenticated user could view any post or page, including those that are marked as draft, pending, private or even password-protected.

### Subscribers List Export

It registers the `niteo_export_csv` AJAX action, used to export its list of subscribers:

```
100   add_action( 'wp_ajax_niteo_export_csv', array( $this, 'niteo_export_csv' ) );
...
...
1829  public function niteo_export_csv() {
1830	   // load subscribers array
1831	   $subscribers = get_option('niteoCS_subscribers_list');
1832
1833	   if( !empty($subscribers) ) {
1834	      $filename = 'cmp-subscribers-export-' . date('Y-m-d') . '.csv';
1835
1836	      header('Content-Type: text/csv');
1837	      header('Content-Disposition: attachment;filename='.$filename);
1838
1839	      $fp = fopen('php://output', 'w');
1840
1841	      fputcsv($fp, array(
1842	         __('ID','cmp-coming-soon-maintenance'),
1843	         __('Date','cmp-coming-soon-maintenance'),
1844	         __('Email','cmp-coming-soon-maintenance'),
1845	         __('Firstname','cmp-coming-soon-maintenance'),
1846	         __('Lastname','cmp-coming-soon-maintenance'),
1847	         __('Fullname', 'cmp-coming-soon-maintenance')
1848	         )
1849	      );
1850	      foreach ( $subscribers as $key => $value ) {
1851
1852
1853
1854	         if ( isset( $value['ip_address'] ) ) {
1855	            unset($subscribers[$key]['ip_address']);
1856	         }
1857
1858	         if ( isset( $value['timestamp'] ) )     {
1859	            $format="Y-m-d H:i:s";
1860	            $subscribers[$key]['timestamp'] = date_i18n($format, $subscribers[$key]['timestamp']);
1861	         }
1862
1863	         $subscribers[$key]['Name'] = '';
1864
1865	         if ( $value['firstname'] !== '' || $value['lastname'] !== '' ) {
1866	            $subscribers[$key]['Name'] = $value['firstname'] . ' ' . $value['lastname'];
1867	         }
1868
1869	         $subscribers[$key]['Name'] = trim($subscribers[$key]['Name']);
1870
1871
1872	      }
1873
1874	      foreach ( $subscribers as $key => $value ) {
1875	         fputcsv($fp, $value, $delimiter = ',', $enclosure = '"' );
1876	      }
1877	      fclose($fp);
1878	   }
1879	   die();
1880  }

```

It lacks a capability check and a security nonce, allowing any authenticated user to download the plugin’s subscribers list which includes email addresses and names.

### Plugin Deactivation

The plugin registers the `cmp_disable_comingsoon_ajax` AJAX action, accessible to anyone, used to disable itself after expiry of the countdown when its “Countdown Timer Setup” option is enabled:

```
109	add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_cmp_disable_comingsoon_ajax', array( $this, 'cmp_disable_comingsoon_ajax' ) );
...
...
1153	public function cmp_disable_comingsoon_ajax() {
1154
1155	   $theme = $this->cmp_selectedTheme();
1156
1157	   if ( !in_array( $theme, $this->cmp_builder_themes() ) ) {
1158	      check_ajax_referer( 'cmp-coming-soon-maintenance-nonce', 'security' );
1159	   }
1160
1161	   $result = array( 'message' => 'error');
1162
1163	   if ( get_option('niteoCS_countdown_action', 'no-action') !== 'disable-cmp' ) {
1164	      echo json_encode( $result );
1165	      wp_die();
1166	   }
1167
1168	   if ( !empty( $_REQUEST['status'] ) && $_REQUEST['status'] === 'disable-cmp' ) {
1169	      update_option('niteoCS_status', '0');
1170	      $this->cmp_purge_cache();
1171	      $result = array( 'message' => 'success');
1172	   }
1173
1174	   echo json_encode( $result );
1175	   wp_die();
1176	}

```

It relies only on a security nonce that is accessible to anyone in the source of the main HTML page:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CMP-Coming-Soon-Maintenance-Plugin_vulnerability.png)

Unauthenticated users could use it to disable the plugin whenever they want.

### Timeline

The vulnerabilities were reported to the authors on July 15th, 2020 and a new version 3.8 was released the following day. However, because it was still possible to access password-protected posts, a new version 3.8.2 was released on August 3rd, 2020.

### Recommendations

Upgrade immediately if you have version 3.8.1 or below. If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.
