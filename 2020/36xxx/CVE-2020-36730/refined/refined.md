Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization check in the `CMP – Coming Soon & Maintenance` WordPress plugin by NiteoThemes. Specifically, the plugin does not properly restrict access to certain AJAX actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin lacks proper capability checks on the following AJAX functions, making them accessible to unauthenticated users.
    *   `cmp_get_post_detail()`: Used to retrieve post details.
    *   `niteo_export_csv()`: Used to export subscriber lists.
    *    `cmp_disable_comingsoon_ajax()`: Used to disable the plugin.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The `cmp_get_post_detail` function directly uses the provided post ID without checking if the user has permission to access that post.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Post Read:** Unauthenticated attackers can view any post or page on the website, regardless of its status (draft, pending, private, password-protected) by manipulating the `id` parameter in the `cmp_get_post_detail` AJAX call.
*   **Subscribers List Export:** Attackers can download the list of subscribers, including email addresses and names, by calling the `niteo_export_csv` AJAX action.
*  **Plugin Deactivation:** Attackers can disable the plugin using the  `cmp_disable_comingsoon_ajax` AJAX action. Although this function uses a nonce check, the nonce is available in the HTML source and therefore provides no real security.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the plugin's AJAX endpoints.
*   Attackers can send requests directly to the vulnerable AJAX actions with the required parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site to exploit these vulnerabilities with the exception of subscriber list export which requires a user to be logged in.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the WordPress website.
*  **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker needs to know that the website is using the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 3.8.1 of the `CMP – Coming Soon & Maintenance` plugin.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.8.2.
*   The plugin has over 100,000 active installations.
*   The exploit was initially discovered by Jerome Bruandet of NinTechNet.
*   The issue is classified as CWE-264 (Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls).
