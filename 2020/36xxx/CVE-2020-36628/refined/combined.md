[`0484f8c`](/Calsign/APDE/commit/0484f8c9151b3aa8e218adb6e76db16dc888c449)

What's new:

* Sketches no longer open in split-screen by default

Note: Google Play now requires all app updates to target API level 30, but doing so breaks the way that APDE currently uses AAPT on Android 10+. As a result, v0.5.2 will not be released on Google Play. Instead, v0.5.3 is in progress and will feature a new approach for running AAPT, among other things.
