Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an unsafe regular expression used in the `EmailValidator` class within the `com.vaadin:vaadin-server` library. This regex is susceptible to exponential backtracking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The email validation regex is vulnerable to ReDoS due to the use of constructs that can lead to exponential backtracking when processing certain specially crafted input strings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By submitting malicious email addresses, an attacker can cause the server's UI thread to spend an excessive amount of time attempting to match the input against the vulnerable regex pattern. This can lead to thread pool or resource exhaustion, making the application unresponsive for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Email Addresses:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by submitting specially crafted email addresses through any email input field that uses the vulnerable `EmailValidator`.
- **Automated Input:** This attack can be performed repeatedly to exacerbate the resource exhaustion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server containing the malicious email addresses. No special privileges are required.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Field:** The attacker needs to know that the application uses the vulnerable email validator and be able to submit an email to it.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code resides in the `com.vaadin.data.validator.EmailValidator` class.
- The affected versions are Vaadin 7.0.0 through 7.7.21.
- The fix is included in Vaadin 7.7.22 and newer 7 versions.
- The provided GitHub links point to the issue report and pull request that fixed the vulnerability.
- The original vulnerable regex was `"^([a-zA-Z0-9_\\.\\-+])+@(([a-zA-Z0-9-])+\\.)+([a-zA-Z0-9]{2,4})+$"`.
- A malicious input example is `a@a.m5qRt8zLxQG4mMeu9yKZm5qRt8zLxQG4mMeu9yKZm5qRt8zLxQG4mMeu9yKZ&`
