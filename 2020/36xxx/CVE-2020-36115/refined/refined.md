{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'Full Name' field allows for the injection of malicious script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the affected page. This can lead to session hijacking, information theft, or further attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects the malicious script into the 'Full Name' field when adding a new record in the application. This payload is then stored and executed when the page is reloaded.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access and interact with the 'add new record' functionality of the application to insert the malicious payload into the 'Full Name' field."
