The provided content relates to CVE-2020-36315.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to two issues in the `relic_cp_rsa.c` file within the RELIC cryptographic library's PKCS#1 v1.5 implementation:
1. The code does not reject malformed inputs when the first two bytes do not match the expected `0x00 0x01`. The `result` variable is overwritten and not checked.
2. The padding bytes are not checked to ensure they are `0xFF`. The padding is only checked for zero termination, which allows the padding to take arbitrary non-zero values.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation of the first two bytes of the signature.
- Inadequate padding verification.
- Susceptibility to Bleichenbacher-style small exponent signature forgery.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can forge RSA signatures when the public exponent `e` is small (typically 3), allowing them to potentially bypass signature verification checks.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a malformed signature that bypasses the insufficient input and padding checks. This forged signature can then be used to impersonate a legitimate signer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a valid signature for the specific modulus, exploiting the PKCS#1 v1.5 padding vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to know the public key with a small exponent.
- No specific network position is required, as the vulnerability lies within the software's signature verification logic.
