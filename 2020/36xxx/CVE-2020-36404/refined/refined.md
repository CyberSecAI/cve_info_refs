Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36404:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by an invalid free operation within the `llvm_ks::SmallVectorImpl<llvm_ks::MCFixup>` destructor. This occurs during the destruction of `llvm_ks::MCEncodedFragmentWithFixups` and `llvm_ks::MCFragment`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Invalid Free:** The core issue is that the code attempts to free memory that is not valid, resulting in a crash. This indicates a memory management error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The primary impact is a program crash due to the invalid free operation. This can lead to a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by specific input that causes the vulnerable code paths within the Keystone Engine to be executed. The exact details of the malicious input are not provided but it is an input that interacts with `llvm_ks::SmallVectorImpl<llvm_ks::MCFixup>` during cleanup.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to provide input to the Keystone Engine that results in the specific code path being executed. This likely requires the ability to assemble code or generate bytecode using the engine.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered via OSS-Fuzz.
- The issue was introduced in commit `23b54ce7493575d13ac88982f30ab523c3d5a3b1` and fixed in commit `1475885daa7e566c064ae9754706e1a0ba24be3b`.
- The affected versions include 0.9.2, 0.9.2-rc1, 0.9.2-rc1.post1, and 0.9.2-rc1.post2.
