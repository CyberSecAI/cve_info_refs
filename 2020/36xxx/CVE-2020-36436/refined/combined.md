## Package

cargo

unicycle
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.7.1

## Patched versions

0.7.1

## Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send` & `Sync` for types `PinSlab<T>` & `Unordered<T, S>`. This allows sending non-Send types to other threads and concurrently accessing non-Sync types from multiple threads.

This can result in a data race & memory corruption when types that provide internal mutability without synchronization are contained within `PinSlab<T>` or `Unordered<T, S>` and accessed concurrently from multiple threads.

The flaw was corrected in commits 92f40b4 & 6a6c367 by adding trait bound `T: Send` to `Send` impls for `PinSlab<T>` & `Unordered<T, S>` and adding `T: Sync` to `Sync` impls for `PinSlab<T>` & `Unordered<T, S>`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Hi there, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are scanning crates on crates.io for potential soundness bugs. We noticed that the `PinSlab`:

[unicycle/src/pin\_slab.rs](https://github.com/udoprog/unicycle/blob/f5a283826ef91e5a07f4b43fea9ec8ae281f84cb/src/pin_slab.rs#L43-L44)

|  | unsafe impl<T> Send for PinSlab<T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<T> Sync for PinSlab<T> {} |

and `Unordered`

[unicycle/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/udoprog/unicycle/blob/f5a283826ef91e5a07f4b43fea9ec8ae281f84cb/src/lib.rs#L380-L381)

Lines 380 to 381
in
[f5a2838](/udoprog/unicycle/commit/f5a283826ef91e5a07f4b43fea9ec8ae281f84cb)

|  | unsafe impl<T, S> Send for Unordered<T, S> where S: Sentinel {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<T, S> Sync for Unordered<T, S> where S: Sentinel {} |

types implement the `Send` and `Sync` traits for all types. This should likely be bounded by `Send`/`Sync` on the contained types otherwise it can lead to data-races from safe Rust code. Here's an example of such a data race with `PinSlab`:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use unicycle::pin_slab::PinSlab;

use std::cell::Cell;
use crossbeam_utils::thread;

// A simple tagged union used to demonstrate problems with data races in Cell.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum RefOrInt { Ref(&'static u64), Int(u64) }
static SOME_INT: u64 = 123;

fn main() {
    let cell = Cell::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));

    let mut slab = PinSlab::new();
    slab.insert(&cell);

    thread::scope(|s| {
        s.spawn(move |_| {
            loop {
                let smuggled_cell = slab.get(0).unwrap();
                // Repeatedly write Ref(&addr) and Int(0xdeadbeef) into the cell.
                smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
                smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
            }
        });

        loop {
            if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = cell.get() {
                // Hope that between the time we pattern match the object as a
                // `Ref`, it gets written to by the other thread.
                if addr as *const u64 == &SOME_INT as *const u64 { continue; }

                // Due to the data race, obtaining Ref(0xdeadbeef) is possible
                println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
                println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
            }
        }
    });
}
```

which outputs:

```
Pointer is now: 0xdeadbeef

Return Code: -11 (SIGSEGV)

```
