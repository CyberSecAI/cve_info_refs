{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `unicycle` crate incorrectly implemented `Send` and `Sync` traits for `PinSlab<T>` and `Unordered<T, S>` types, without proper bounds on the contained types `T` and `S`. This allows for sending non-Send types to other threads and concurrently accessing non-Sync types from multiple threads.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Data race",
      "Memory corruption",
      "Incorrect implementation of Send and Sync traits"
    ],
    "impact": "A data race and memory corruption can occur when types with internal mutability (but lacking synchronization) are contained within `PinSlab<T>` or `Unordered<T, S>` and accessed concurrently from multiple threads. This can lead to undefined behavior and program crashes.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending non-Send types to other threads and accessing non-Sync types concurrently from multiple threads within a program that uses the vulnerable `unicycle` crate.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the use of the `PinSlab<T>` or `Unordered<T, S>` types with non-Send or non-Sync types, and to access these types concurrently from different threads. No special privileges are required."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "fixed_version": "0.7.1",
    "fix_description": "The issue was corrected by adding trait bounds `T: Send` to `Send` implementations for `PinSlab<T>` and `Unordered<T, S>`, and `T: Sync` to `Sync` implementations for those types.",
