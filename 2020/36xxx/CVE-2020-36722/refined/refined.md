Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36722:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is the insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Visual Composer plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin allows users, including those with low privileges like contributors, to inject arbitrary web scripts (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) that are stored and then executed in a victim's browser when they view a page or post containing the injected code.
    *   The plugin's "CSS, HTML & JavaScript" settings tab and the post editor were vulnerable.
    *   The plugin failed to properly sanitize user input when processing code for header/footer and post content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browser of anyone viewing the affected pages. This can lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the website.
    *   **Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Delivering malware to site visitors.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Elevating the attacker's privileges on the website by executing admin actions through the compromised user's browser.
*   **Global Code Injection:** Malicious scripts injected through these vulnerabilities are executed on every page/post of the website, potentially impacting all users.
*   **Bypassing Security Measures**: The plugin's encoding and compression of user input when saving posts could bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and security plugins, making it harder to detect and block malicious payloads.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Admin Settings:** Attackers can inject malicious code through the "CSS, HTML & JavaScript" settings tab within the WordPress admin panel.
*   **Post Editor:** Attackers can inject malicious code directly into posts using the Visual Composer editor. Even if the post isn't published (saved as a draft) the code is executed.
*   **AJAX Requests:** The plugin's handling of AJAX requests (`vcv-admin-ajax`) was also vulnerable. Attackers could send a crafted request with malicious code in a compressed and encoded form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:** An attacker needs a WordPress user account with minimal permissions, such as a "contributor", to exploit the vulnerability through the post editor and potentially through the settings tab due to an authorization issue.
*   **Access to the WordPress Backend:** The attacker needs access to the WordPress admin interface to manipulate the vulnerable plugin settings or create/edit content through the post editor.
*   **No Special Network Access:** The attack can be carried out remotely via HTTP requests, so there is no need for the attacker to have local network access.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Jerome Bruandet from NinTechNet.
*   The vulnerable versions are Visual Composer <= 26.0.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 27.0 of the plugin.
*   The injected code is executed in both backend and frontend.
*   The plugin uses base64 encoding, zlib compression, and JSON to obfuscate data sent through AJAX requests.
