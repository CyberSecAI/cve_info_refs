The provided content relates to CVE-2020-36364.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `ImportController.Create` method in SmartStore.NET does not validate the `model.TempFileName` user-controlled input, allowing for a path traversal attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability
- Lack of input validation of user-supplied filename
- Arbitrary file copy and delete

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can copy an arbitrary file into a new profile and delete the original file. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files or denial of service by deleting critical files.

**Attack vectors:**
The `model.TempFileName` parameter in the `ImportController.Create` method is vulnerable. An attacker could craft a malicious `TempFileName` with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access and copy files outside of the intended directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the `model.TempFileName` parameter. The attacker would need to be able to submit this value to the vulnerable `ImportController.Create` method.
