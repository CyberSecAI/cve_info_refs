This is in response to issue [681](https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla-patches/issues/681) in [vanilla-patches](https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla-patches).

Update in the `SafeCurl` `execute` method using the `CURLOPT_RESOLVE` curl option. Prior to this fix an attacker could rebind DNS records between when the request URL is checked against the blacklist of IPs and when the curl request is executed.

Sorry, something went wrong.

This is a solid addition to the library. I'd like to get some tests around the functionality before we call it complete.

I don't think we need to put all the standard ports in here. We should be able to determine the port from the URL. We're only pinning the DNS resolution for this request, so this is looping for the sake of pinning at least two more than we need.

It's possible for the URL to use a non-standard port. We default to these standard three, but the library could be used in such a way that additional ports could be whitelisted. As it stands, we're only pinning the three standards, so no pinning would occur for a URL with a non-standard port.

It looks like we already have an exception condition for this in `UrlValidator`.

[safecurl/src/UrlValidator.php](https://github.com/vanilla/safecurl/blob/84be09328597549260d28a0b96db0bb30f58e25a/src/UrlValidator.php#L162)

If `validateUrl` doesn't throw any exceptions, I think it should give us everything we need. If any of the pieces are missing or invalid, exceptions are thrown as part of validating the URL.

I think this is unnecessary, because if the call to `validateUrl` is returning anything, it'll be the full array including `host` and `ips` (it should probably be returning an object of a particular class, but that's a future improvement we can make). This *should* never be thrown, but if you think it's a good idea to keep it, I'm okay with leaving it in for now.

Since there are no breaks in this switch, HTTP will be set to 80, then 443, then 80 again. That works out by coincidence. But I think HTTPS is going to be 443, then fall through to 80, which won't apply the proper DNS pinning. Once we fix that, it'll be a good candidate for a test.

I know this is easier to test as a public member, but it seems like something we don't want to expose (it'll be a pain to enforce `$url` is actually the return value of `validateUrl` if used outside this class). Can it be defined as a private member, while still being testable?

Yup, just used reflection in the test to open up the method when testing.
