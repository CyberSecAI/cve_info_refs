Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of security measures in AJAX calls within multiple WordPress plugins developed by "e-plugins". Specifically, the `update_user_meta` function is used without proper sanitization or authorization checks, allowing arbitrary user meta data updates through AJAX requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure AJAX Handling:** The plugins do not properly validate or sanitize data received in AJAX requests before using it to update user meta.
*   **Arbitrary Meta Data Update:** The plugins use `update_user_meta` without proper checks, allowing any user to modify their user roles, capabilities, or other user-related settings.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A subscriber-level user can exploit this vulnerability to grant themselves administrator privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full Site Compromise:** By escalating privileges to an administrator role, an attacker gains full control of the WordPress site.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify content, create new users, delete user accounts, install malicious plugins or themes, and perform other administrative functions.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker can deface the website and cause significant damage to the site's reputation.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive information stored on the website such as user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **AJAX Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through crafted AJAX requests targeting specific plugin endpoints, like `iv_directories_update_profile_setting` or `ep_finaluser_update_user_settings`.
*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The attacker can send HTTP POST requests with malicious parameters directly to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Subscriber or higher:** The attacker only needs a valid user account on the WordPress site which can be a subscriber-level account, as user registration is possible through a custom form in the plugins, even if the blog does not allow registration.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple plugins by the same developer, e-plugins, including:
    *   `directory-pro`
    *   `final-user-wp-frontend-user-profiles`
    *    `producer-retailer`
    *   `photographer-directory`
    *   `real-estate-pro`
    *   `institutions-directory`
    *   `lawyer-directory`
    *   `doctor-listing`
    *   `hotel-listing`
    *   `fitness-trainer`
    *   `wp-membership`

*   The vulnerability was originally researched by Omar Badran, and the vulnerability has a CVSS score of 10.0 (Critical).
*   The plugins `producer-retailer` doesn't have a known fix.
*   The provided content includes proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code snippets using both jQuery AJAX and standard HTML forms to demonstrate the vulnerability.
