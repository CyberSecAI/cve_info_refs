Patched

* `>=1.0.4`

### Description

`ButtplugFutureStateShared<T>` implements `Send` & `Sync` regardless of `T`.

If `T: !Send` for `ButtplugFutureStateShared<T>`, it is possible to move non-Send types across thread boundaries (e.g. `T`=`Rc<T>`) and lead to undefined behavior.
If `T: !Sync` for `ButtplugFutureStateShared<T>`, it is possible to cause data race to `T` (e.g. `T`=`Arc<Cell<_>>`) and lead to undefined behavior.

The flaw was corrected in version 1.0.4 by removing manual implementations of `Send`/`Sync` for `ButtplugFutureStateShared<T>` to let rustc generate auto trait implementations with correct trait bounds on `T`.

## Description

![@JOE1994](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10286488?u=b10074df08a0e21e9483938c26612ad8e9dfec4b&v=4&size=48)[JOE1994](https://github.com/JOE1994)opened [on Dec 19, 2020](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug/issues/225#issue-771272389)

Hello ðŸ¦€,

we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) found a memory-safety/soundness issue in this crate while scanning Rust code on crates.io for potential vulnerabilities.

## Issue (**Describe the bug**)

`Send`/`Sync` are unconditionally implemented for `ButtplugFutureStateShared`,

and thus it is possible to cause a data race to a (`!Send`|`!Sync`) object.

```
unsafe impl<T> Send for ButtplugFutureStateShared<T> {
}
unsafe impl<T> Sync for ButtplugFutureStateShared<T> {
}
```
## Proof of Concept (**Actual behavior**)

Below is an example program that segfaults while using `ButtplugFutureStateShared`.

**Segmentation fault** was observed when the program was built with `rustc 1.49.0-nightly` in `Debug` mode (on `Ubuntu 18.04`).

The program below allows two threads to concurrently access the same `Cell`

(one thread writes to `Cell` while the other thread reads from `Cell`).

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
use buttplug::util::future::ButtplugFuture;
use futures::executor;

use std::cell::Cell;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum RefOrInt<'a> {
    Ref(&'a u64),
    Int(u64),
}
static X: u64 = 0;

fn main() {
    let future = ButtplugFuture::default();
    let shared = future.get_state_clone();

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let shared = shared;

        let cell = Arc::new(Cell::new(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef)));
        shared.set_reply(Arc::clone(&cell));

        loop {
            cell.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
            cell.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&X))
        }
    });

    let smuggled_cell: Arc<Cell<RefOrInt>> = executor::block_on(future);
    println!("Future resolved");

    loop {
        if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = smuggled_cell.get() {
            if addr as *const _ as usize != 0xdeadbeef {
                continue;
            }
            // Due to the data race, obtaining Ref(0xdeadbeef) is possible
            println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
            println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
        }
    }
}
```
## Suggested Solution

Adding `T: Send` bound to the `Send` impl & `T:Sync` bound to the `Sync` impl can

prevent code like the above to be revoked by the compiler.

```
unsafe impl<T: Send> Send for ButtplugFutureStateShared<T> {
}
unsafe impl<T: Sync> Sync for ButtplugFutureStateShared<T> {
}
```

Thank you for reviewing this issue ðŸ¦€

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
