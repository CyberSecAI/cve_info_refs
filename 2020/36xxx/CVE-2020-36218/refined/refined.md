Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36218:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `ButtplugFutureStateShared<T>` struct in the `buttplug` crate implementing `Send` and `Sync` traits unconditionally, regardless of the type `T`. This is incorrect because `Send` and `Sync` traits have specific requirements on the contained type T. Specifically, `Send` means it is safe to send the type across threads, and `Sync` means it is safe to share the type across threads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Data Race:** When `T` is not `Send` or `Sync`, the unconditional `Send` and `Sync` implementations allow for moving non-`Send` types across thread boundaries, or for data races when sharing non-`Sync` types, leading to undefined behavior and memory corruption.
- **Incorrect Trait Implementations:** The manual, unconditional implementations of `Send` and `Sync` for `ButtplugFutureStateShared<T>` were incorrect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Undefined Behavior:** Exploitation leads to undefined behavior due to data races and incorrect use of multi-threading primitives, including the possibility of memory corruption, and program crashes (segmentation fault).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Multi-threading:** The vulnerability is exposed when using the `ButtplugFutureStateShared` struct in a multi-threaded context where the type `T` is not `Send` or `Sync`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a multi-threaded application that uses the vulnerable `buttplug` crate and creates instances of `ButtplugFutureStateShared` with a type that is not `Send` or `Sync`.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by removing manual implementations of `Send` and `Sync` for `ButtplugFutureStateShared<T>` and letting Rust's compiler handle it. This ensures correct trait bounds on `T`.
- The provided code example demonstrates how a data race can be triggered using `Arc<Cell<>>`, a type that is `Sync` but not thread-safe unless wrapped in a mutex.
- The vulnerability is categorized as both a memory corruption and a thread-safety issue.
- The CVSS score is 5.9 (MEDIUM), with high availability impact.
