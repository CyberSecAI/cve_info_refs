{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the insecure configuration of the default `ObjectMapper` in Vaadin Flow server. It was modifying the default `ObjectMapper` bean in Spring to expose private and protected properties in the JSON response.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-200)"
    ],
    "impact": "This could lead to accidental exposure of sensitive data through JSON responses, particularly if the application also uses Spring's `@RestController` or similar mechanisms for creating REST APIs.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the application"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to send a network request to an affected application endpoint that serializes objects to JSON, and be able to observe the JSON response.",
        "details": "The vulnerability was introduced in Vaadin 15 (versions 15.0.0 through 15.0.4) where the framework modified the default Spring `ObjectMapper` bean, causing it to serialize private and protected properties, which are typically not exposed. This could happen for example when using Spring's `@RestController` annotation or similar, which may unintentionally leak sensitive information through the API endpoint. Vaadin 15.0.5 fixed this issue by using a separate `ObjectMapper` instance specific to Vaadin Connect, instead of modifying the global one used by Spring and other parts of the application."
