Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36442:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `beef::Cow` type in versions prior to 0.5.0 lacked a `Sync` bound on its `Send` trait implementation. This allowed users to create data races by using `Cow` with types that are `Send` but not `Sync`, such as `Cell` or `RefCell`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing `Sync` bound:** The core issue is the absence of a `T: Sync` bound in the `Send` implementation for `Cow<'_, T, U>`. This allows `Cow` to be used to share mutable data across threads without proper synchronization.
- **Data Races:** The lack of synchronization when sharing non-`Sync` data across threads leads to data races, where multiple threads access and modify shared data concurrently, resulting in unpredictable behavior and potential memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Data races caused by improper use of `Cow` can lead to memory corruption.
- **Arbitrary Memory Read:** The provided code examples demonstrate how data races can be exploited to read arbitrary memory locations by racing access to a shared `Cell`. This can result in reading potentially sensitive data.
- **Segmentation Fault:** Dereferencing the read memory can trigger a segmentation fault and crash the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Multi-threaded Applications:** The vulnerability is exploitable in multi-threaded Rust applications where a `Cow` containing non-`Sync` types is shared between threads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to control code:** The attacker needs the ability to introduce multi-threaded logic using `beef::Cow` in a vulnerable way.
- **No special privileges are required.**

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was corrected by adding `T: Sync` and `T::Owned: Send` trait bounds to the `Send` implementation for `Cow<'_, T, U>` in commit `d1c7658`.
- The issue was reported on October 28, 2020, and patched in version 0.5.0 of the `beef` crate.
