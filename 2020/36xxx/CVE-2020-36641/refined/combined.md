This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix CWE-611

This commit fixes the issue described on
<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html>

Nb: it's mostly the same as [ad6615b](https://github.com/gturri/aXMLRPC/commit/ad6615b3ec41353e614f6ea5fdd5b046442a832b) but
with an added reference to org.apache.xerces in order to avoid the
AbstractMethodError that was experienced by users back then.

Nb2: writting down the payload with which I tested this patch, in case I
need to run this test again in the future:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY ent SYSTEM "http://localhost/malware"> ]>
    <methodResponse>
        <params>
            <param>
               <value><string>&ent;</string></value>
            </param>
        </params>
    </methodResponse>
```
