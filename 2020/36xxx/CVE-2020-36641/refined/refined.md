Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2020-36641:

**1. Verification of CVE Relation:**

The provided content is directly related to the fix for CWE-611, which is a common cause for XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities.  While not explicitly mentioning CVE-2020-36641, the description and code changes in the commit directly address a vulnerability described by CWE-611, which is the primary goal of the fix commit. Thus, it is highly likely that this commit is associated with a fix for CVE-2020-36641, but further information is required to confirm this.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the insecure processing of XML data, specifically the lack of proper configuration of the XML parser. The vulnerability arises from the XML parser's default behavior of resolving external entities defined in a Document Type Definition (DTD).

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE Vulnerability (CWE-611):** The application was vulnerable to XML External Entity injection. This occurs because the XML parser was not configured to prevent the expansion of external entities.
*   **DTD Processing:** The XML parser, by default, was processing DTDs, which allowed for the inclusion of external entities.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially access local files on the server hosting the aXMLRPC service by defining an external entity that points to the local file system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could cause a denial of service by pointing an external entity to a large file, causing the server to exhaust resources while attempting to resolve the large entity.
*  **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker could make requests to internal or external resources from the vulnerable server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious XML Payload:** The attacker would craft a malicious XML payload that includes a DTD containing an external entity. This payload would be sent to the vulnerable application.
*   **XMLRPC Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses XML responses from the XMLRPC server. An attacker can inject malicious XML into the response and trick the parser into resolving the entities.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send XMLRPC Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the XMLRPC service.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to communicate with the server.
*   **Knowledge of the XMLRPC Structure:** The attacker would need some knowledge of the expected XMLRPC structure in order to embed the malicious payload within it.

**7. Technical Details:**

*   **Code Changes:** The fix commit introduces the following changes:
    *   `factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);` This line disables DTD processing, preventing the inclusion of external entities.
    *   `factory.setExpandEntityReferences(false);` This disables the expansion of internal entity references.
    *   `factory.setNamespaceAware(true);` and `factory.setXIncludeAware(false);`
         These two methods should not have impact on the reported security issue, but it is good practice to declare them with the reported values.
    *   Added `xercesImpl` dependency to resolve a reported `AbstractMethodError`.
*   **Payload Example:** The commit description includes an example XML payload used to test the vulnerability, demonstrating how an external entity is defined using `<!ENTITY ent SYSTEM "http://localhost/malware">`.

In summary, the content clearly demonstrates a fix for an XXE vulnerability (CWE-611) in aXMLRPC by disabling DTD processing and external entity expansion in the XML parser. This prevents attackers from exploiting the vulnerable XML parser to access local files or cause a denial of service on the server. The attacker needs to send a malicious XMLRPC request to the vulnerable server.
