Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The `MessageBundleWhiteList` class within the `atlassian-gadgets` plugin incorrectly obtains the application base URL from the HTTP request. This allows an attacker to control the base URL through a crafted request.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application uses an attacker-controlled base URL to make DNS lookups and HTTP requests to arbitrary services.
    *   **Incorrect Base URL Handling:** The application's logic to determine its base URL is flawed, making it susceptible to manipulation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can use the SSRF vulnerability to:
    *   Perform unauthorized DNS lookups.
    *   Make HTTP requests to internal servers or external services.
    *   Potentially gain access to sensitive data or systems behind the firewall.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable application. Specifically, by manipulating the base URL used by the `atlassian-gadgets` plugin.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Jira server. They do not need to be authenticated, according to the provided text.

**Affected Versions:**
* Versions of `atlassian-gadgets` before 4.2.37
* Versions from 4.3.0 before 4.3.14
* Versions from 4.3.2.0 before 4.3.2.4
* Versions from 4.4.0 before 4.4.12
* Version 5.0.0
* Jira Server and Data Center versions before 8.5.10, from 8.6.0 before 8.13.2, and from 8.14.0 before 8.14.1.

**Fixed Versions:**
*  atlassian-gadgets: 4.2.37, 4.3.14, 4.3.2.4, 4.4.12, 5.0.1
*  Jira Server and Data Center versions: 8.5.10, 8.13.2, 8.14.1, 8.15.0
