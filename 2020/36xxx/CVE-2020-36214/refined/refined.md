Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36214:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the incorrect implementation of the `Send` trait for several types (`InnerSend<RW, T>`, `InnerRecv<RW, T>`, `FutInnerSend<RW, T>`, `FutInnerRecv<RW, T>`) within the `multiqueue2` crate. These types were used in queue implementations. The `Send` trait in Rust indicates that a type can be safely transferred between threads. The implementation of `Send` for those types was unconditional and did not require the contained type `T` to also implement `Send`. This allowed non-Send types to be sent across threads, violating Rust's safety guarantees.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect `Send` Implementation:** The core issue is the unconditional `Send` implementation for the aforementioned queue-related types, regardless of whether the contained type `T` was `Send`.
*   **Data Races:** The ability to send non-`Send` types across threads can lead to data races, where multiple threads access and modify shared memory concurrently without proper synchronization.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** Data races can result in unpredictable behavior, including memory corruption, segmentation faults, and other forms of undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Data races can lead to memory corruption.
*   **Segmentation Faults:** The provided proof-of-concept code demonstrates how sending non-Send types across threads can lead to segmentation faults.
*   **Memory Leaks**: The second example program shows how data races can lead to memory leaks.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** The vulnerability can lead to various forms of unpredictable and undesirable program behavior.
*   **Denial of Service (Availability Impact):** The resulting crashes and unpredictable behavior can make the affected programs unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Multi-threaded programs**: Attackers need to use the affected crate in a multi-threaded context.
*   **Sending non-Send types**: Attackers need to send non-Send types using the vulnerable queues.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Use the Crate:** An attacker needs to be able to use the `multiqueue2` crate in a project.
*   **Multi-threading Context:** The attacker needs to use the crate in a multi-threaded context where data is sent between threads using the queue.
*   **Knowledge of Non-Send Types:** The attacker needs to be able to construct examples involving non-Send types.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding `T: Send` bounds to the `Send` implementations of affected types, ensuring that only `Send` types can be used with the queues.
*   The provided proof-of-concept examples effectively demonstrate the data races that can occur due to the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS score of 5.9 (Medium) with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`.
*   The vulnerability is associated with CWE-662 (Improper Synchronization).
