![@JOE1994](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10286488?u=b10074df08a0e21e9483938c26612ad8e9dfec4b&v=4&size=48)[JOE1994](https://github.com/JOE1994)opened [on Dec 19, 2020](https://github.com/abbychau/multiqueue2/issues/10#issue-771379357)

Hello 🦀,

we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) found a memory-safety/soundness issue in this crate while scanning Rust code on crates.io for potential vulnerabilities.

## Issue

`T` is not bound to `Send` in the following `Send` impls, and thus all queue APIs provided by the crate (except for `MPMCSender, MPMCReceiver`) can send non-Send types to other threads. This can allow data race bugs in `safe` Rust programs.

```
unsafe impl<RW: QueueRW<T>, T> Send for InnerSend<RW, T> {}
unsafe impl<RW: QueueRW<T>, T> Send for InnerRecv<RW, T> {}
unsafe impl<RW: QueueRW<T>, T> Send for FutInnerSend<RW, T> {}
unsafe impl<RW: QueueRW<T>, T> Send for FutInnerRecv<RW, T> {}
```
## Proof of Concept

I wrote two example programs that can trigger **data race bugs** while using this crate.

Both programs were tested on `Ubuntu 18.04`, using `rustc 1.49.0-nightly` in `Debug` mode.

Example Program 1 (Click to expand)
#### This creates a data race to a `Cell`, causing memory corruption & segmentation fault.

```
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::cell::Cell;
use std::thread;
// futures = "0.1.27"
use futures::{Future, Sink, Stream};

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum RefOrInt<'a> {
    Ref(&'a u64),
    Int(u64),
}
static X: u64 = 0;

use multiqueue2::mpmc_fut_queue;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpmc_fut_queue(16);
    let cell = Arc::new(Cell::new(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef)));
    let sent = tx.send(Arc::clone(&cell));

    thread::spawn(move || {
        let mut rx = rx.wait();

        // parent thread sent us an object that is not `Send`!
        let smuggled_cell = rx.next().unwrap().unwrap();

        loop {
            smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
            smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&X))
        }
    });
    sent.wait().unwrap();

    loop {
        if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = cell.get() {
            if addr as *const _ as usize != 0xdeadbeef {
                continue;
            }
            // Due to the data race, obtaining Ref(0xdeadbeef) is possible
            println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
            println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
        }
    }
}
```

Example Program 2 (Click to expand)
#### This creates a data race to a single `Rc`, causing either a segmentation fault (illegal instruction) or a memory leak.

```
use multiqueue2::mpmc_fut_queue;
// futures = "0.1.27"
use futures::{Future, Sink, Stream};

use std::thread;
use std::rc::Rc;

const NUM_THREADS: usize = 8;
fn main() {
    let (mut tx, rx) = mpmc_fut_queue(16);
    let non_send = Rc::new(0);

    let mut children = Vec::with_capacity(NUM_THREADS);
    let rx_clones = vec![rx.clone(); NUM_THREADS];

    for rx in rx_clones.into_iter() {
        let sent = tx.send(Rc::clone(&non_send));
        children.push(thread::spawn(move || {
            let smuggled_rc = rx.wait().next().unwrap().unwrap();
            for _ in 0..900_000 {
                let _ = Rc::clone(&smuggled_rc);
            }
        }));
        tx = sent.wait().unwrap();
    }
    for child_thread in children.into_iter() {
        child_thread.join().unwrap();
    }

    assert_eq!(Rc::strong_count(&non_send), 1);
}
```
## Solution

One solution for the issue is to add `T: Send` bounds to the following types' `Send` impls as below.

After making the following changes, the compiler can revoke programs that use the queues to send non-Send types to other threads.

Please let me know about your opinion on the suggested changes :)

```
unsafe impl<RW: QueueRW<T>, T: Send> Send for InnerSend<RW, T> {}
unsafe impl<RW: QueueRW<T>, T: Send> Send for InnerRecv<RW, T> {}
unsafe impl<RW: QueueRW<T>, T: Send> Send for FutInnerSend<RW, T> {}
unsafe impl<RW: QueueRW<T>, T: Send> Send for FutInnerRecv<RW, T> {}
```

Thank you for reviewing this issue 👍

### Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send` for types used in queue implementations (`InnerSend<RW, T>`, `InnerRecv<RW, T>`, `FutInnerSend<RW, T>`, `FutInnerRecv<RW, T>`).

This allows users to send non-Send types to other threads, which can lead to data race bugs or other undefined behavior.

The flaw was corrected in v0.1.7 by adding `T: Send` bound to to the `Send` impl of four data types explained above.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
