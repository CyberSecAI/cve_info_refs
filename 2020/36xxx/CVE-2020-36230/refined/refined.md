    "description": "Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenLDAP, a free implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. An unauthenticated remote attacker can take advantage of these flaws to cause a denial of service (slapd daemon crash, infinite loops) via specially crafted packets.",

    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `ldap_X509dn2bv` function where a crafted packet with invalid BER encoding after the RDN count can lead to an assertion failure and a crash of the `slapd` daemon. This is due to insufficient checks on the validity of the BER encoded data.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation of BER encoded data.",
        "Lack of checks for invalid BER data after the RDN count in `ldap_X509dn2bv` function."

      "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) due to `slapd` daemon crash.",

        "Sending a specially crafted packet to OpenLDAP server, triggering the vulnerable code path in `ldap_X509dn2bv`."
