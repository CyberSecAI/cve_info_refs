  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing injection of malicious script code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent redirects to malicious sources, and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities are exploited through POST requests to the vulnerable files, injecting malicious scripts via the `activepath`, `keyword`, `tag`, `fmdo=x&filename`, `CKEditor` and `CKEditorFuncNum` parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a privileged user account and low user interaction is required for exploitation."
