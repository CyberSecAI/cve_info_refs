- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in several parameters (`filename`, `mid`, `userid`, `templet`) across multiple files (`tpl.php`, `mychannel_edit.php`, `file_manage_view.php`, `sys_admin_user_edit.php`, `makehtml_homepage.php`). This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization. The XSS is non-persistent, client-side.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent redirects to malicious sites, and non-persistent manipulation of affected application modules.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is non-persistent and client-side. The vulnerable parameters are passed via the GET method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not need any privileges or a session. Low user interaction is required to trigger the exploit. The attacker needs to craft malicious URLs containing the XSS payload.
