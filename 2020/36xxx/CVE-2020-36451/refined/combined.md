# Send/Sync bound needed on T for Send/Sync impl of RcuCell
Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `RcuCell`.
This allows users to send `T: !Send` to other threads (while `T` enclosed within `RcuCell`), and allows users to concurrently access `T: !Sync` by using the APIs of `RcuCell` that provide access to `&T`.
This can result in memory corruption caused by data races.

### Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `RcuCell<T>`.
This allows users to send `T: !Send` to other threads (while `T` enclosed within `RcuCell<T>`), and allows users to concurrently access `T: !Sync` by using the APIs of `RcuCell<T>` that provide access to `&T`.

This can result in memory corruption caused by data races.

## Description

![@JOE1994](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10286488?u=b10074df08a0e21e9483938c26612ad8e9dfec4b&v=4&size=48)[JOE1994](https://github.com/JOE1994)opened [on Nov 15, 2020](https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/rcu_cell/issues/3#issue-743165354)

Hello! ðŸ¦€, while scanning crates.io., we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) have noticed a soundness/memory safety issue in this crate which allows safe Rust code to trigger undefined behavior.

## Issue

* There is no `Send` bound on `T` of `Send` impl of `RcuCell<T>`
* There is no `Sync` bound on `T` of `Sync` impl of `RcuCell<T>`

```
unsafe impl<T> Send for RcuCell<T> {}
unsafe impl<T> Sync for RcuCell<T> {}
```

By exploiting this issue, it's possible to send non-`Send` items to other threads,

or share a non-`Sync` item concurrently across multiple threads.

## Proof of Concept

You need to run the below program in **Debug** mode in order to observe undefined behavior.

In the program below, multiple threads clone & drop `Rc`(which is neither Send nor Sync).

Since `Rc`'s internal `strong_count` is updated by multiple threads without synchronization,

the program will terminate in either one of the following states.

* **`strong_count` > 1**
  + program panics at the assertion check at the end (indicates memory leak in this case)
* **`strong_count` == 0**
  + `Rc` is dropped while references to it are still alive.

    When run on Ubuntu 18.04, program crashes with error: `Illegal Instruction (Core Dumped)`
* **`strong_count` == 1**
  + Not impossible, but highly unlikely

```
use rcu_cell::RcuCell;

use std::rc::Rc;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    // `Rc` is neither `Send` nor `Sync`
    let rcu_cell = RcuCell::new(Some(Rc::new(0_i32)));
    let arc_parent = Arc::new(rcu_cell);

    let mut child_threads = vec![];
    for _ in 0..5 {
        let arc_child = Arc::clone(&arc_parent);
        child_threads.push(thread::spawn(move || {
            for _ in 0..1000 {
                let reader = arc_child.as_ref().read();
                // data race on internal `strong_count` of `Rc`
                let _ = Rc::clone(&reader.unwrap());
            }
        }));
    }
    for child in child_threads {
        child.join().expect("failed to join child thread");
    }

    assert_eq!(Rc::strong_count(arc_parent.read().as_ref().unwrap()), 1);
}
```
## How to fix

Adding trait bounds to Send/Sync impls of `RcuCell` as below would be one way to fix the issue.

```
unsafe impl<T: Send> Send for RcuCell<T> {}
unsafe impl<T: Sync> Sync for RcuCell<T> {}
```

Thank you for reviewing this issue! ðŸ¦€

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `RcuCell<T>`.

This allows users to send `T: !Send` to other threads (while `T` enclosed within `RcuCell<T>`), and allows users to concurrently access `T: !Sync` by using the APIs of `RcuCell<T>` that provide access to `&T`.

This can result in memory corruption caused by data races.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
