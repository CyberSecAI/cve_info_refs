Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of user input within the `HTTPEngine.Handle` function of the `aah` framework. This lack of proper sanitization allows for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. The application does not adequately validate or sanitize user-supplied paths, allowing an attacker to access files and directories outside the intended webroot.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server that the server process has permission to access. This can include source code, configuration files, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network (HTTP).
*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to navigate to directories outside the intended scope.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the network and doesn't require any prior access or privileges.
*   **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered without requiring any user interaction.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `HTTPEngine.Handle` function of the `aah` framework.
*   The fix involved using `path.Clean(r.URL.Path)` to sanitize the URL path.
*   The vulnerable versions are prior to `0.12.4`.
*   The fix is available in version `0.12.4` and later.
*   The vulnerability was reported on March 3, 2020, and a patch was released the same day.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was reported by Louis (@snyff) and fixed by jeevatkm.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `881dc9f` and merged in pull request #267.
*   The vulnerability has a high severity score of 7.5 according to CVSS v3 metrics, with a high impact on confidentiality.
