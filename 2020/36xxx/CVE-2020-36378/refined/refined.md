The provided content is related to CVE-2020-36378.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure command formatting in the `aaptjs` library, specifically within the `exec()` function call. User-provided input is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing for the injection of arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection: The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to insert malicious commands within the user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application.
- Information Disclosure: Attackers may gain access to sensitive data.
- Denial of Service (DoS): Attackers might be able to disrupt the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `exec` function call in `aaptjs/index.js`, specifically line 18, where unsanitized user input is used to construct a command for execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply input that is then passed to the vulnerable function.
