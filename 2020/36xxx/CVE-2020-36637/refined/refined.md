Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The code was not properly sanitizing user-supplied data before displaying it, specifically within the `info()` function in `resources/core/adminserv.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS Vulnerability:** The `info()` function in `adminserv.php` was directly outputting user-provided input without any sanitization to the `$_SESSION['info']` variable. This allowed a malicious user to inject JavaScript code which would be executed by other users when viewing the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the browser of other users.
- **Session Hijacking:** The injected JavaScript could potentially steal session cookies, allowing the attacker to hijack user accounts.
- **Data Manipulation:** Malicious scripts could be used to modify page content, steal sensitive data, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other unauthorized actions.
- **Phishing:** Attackers could inject code to display fake login forms, tricking users into providing credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulating input:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into input fields or any other areas where user input is stored in the `$_SESSION['info']` variable.
- **Context:** When the application reads the `$_SESSION['info']` variable and displays it, the injected javascript is then rendered and executed in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to submit input into the application that is not properly sanitized before being stored in the `$_SESSION['info']` variable.
- No specific user position is required, an attacker can be any user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involved using the `htmlspecialchars()` function to properly encode user input before storing it, thus preventing the execution of injected JavaScript.
- This was the second XSS vulnerability found, suggesting that input sanitization was not being handled correctly across the application.
