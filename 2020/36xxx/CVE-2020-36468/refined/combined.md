## Affected versions

<= 0.4.0

## Patched versions

None

## Description

Affected versions of this crate have the following issues:

1. `Ptr` implements `Send` and `Sync` for all types, this can lead to data

   races by sending non-thread safe types across threads.
2. `Ptr::get` violates mutable alias rules by returning multiple mutable

   references to the same object.
3. `Ptr::write` uses non-atomic writes to the underlying pointer. This means

   that when used across threads it can lead to data races.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Multiple soundness issues in `Ptr`
Affected versions of this crate have the following issues:
1. `Ptr` implements `Send` and `Sync` for all types, this can lead to data
races by sending non-thread safe types across threads.
2. `Ptr::get` violates mutable alias rules by returning multiple mutable
references to the same object.
3. `Ptr::write` uses non-atomic writes to the underlying pointer. This means
that when used across threads it can lead to data races.

## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Dec 10, 2020](https://github.com/playXE/cgc/issues/5#issue-761020963)

Hi there, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are scanning crates on crates.io for potential soundness bugs. We noticed that some soundness issues in the `Ptr` class.

---

1. `Ptr` implements the `Send` and `Sync` traits for all types:

[cgc/src/mem.rs](https://github.com/playXE/cgc/blob/e8e277fc0018fc00899a730158239c3acf0b86da/src/mem.rs#L829-L830)

Lines 829 to 830
in
[e8e277f](/playXE/cgc/commit/e8e277fc0018fc00899a730158239c3acf0b86da)

|  | unsafe impl<T> Send for Ptr<T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<T> Sync for Ptr<T> {} |

This allows you to send types that aren't safe to use across threads like `Rc` and `Cell`. We'd recommend only implementing this when the `T: Send` and `T: Sync`.

---

2. `Ptr` violates aliasing rules by having `.get()` take a reference and return a mutable reference.

[cgc/src/mem.rs](https://github.com/playXE/cgc/blob/e8e277fc0018fc00899a730158239c3acf0b86da/src/mem.rs#L760-L764)

Lines 760 to 764
in
[e8e277f](/playXE/cgc/commit/e8e277fc0018fc00899a730158239c3acf0b86da)

|  | impl<T: ?Sized> Ptr<T> { |
| --- | --- |
|  | pub fn get(&self) -> &mut T { |
|  | unsafe { &mut \*self.0 } |
|  | } |
|  | } |

This allows you to create multiple mutable references to the same object which is undefined behavior in Rust.

---

3. `Ptr::write` writes to the raw pointer underneath:

[cgc/src/mem.rs](https://github.com/playXE/cgc/blob/e8e277fc0018fc00899a730158239c3acf0b86da/src/mem.rs#L775-L777)

Lines 775 to 777
in
[e8e277f](/playXE/cgc/commit/e8e277fc0018fc00899a730158239c3acf0b86da)

|  | pub fn set(&self, val: T) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe { self.0.write(val) }; |
|  | } |

This can lead to data-races, using an atomic pointer would be better if you want to support multiple threads.

---

Here's a proof-of-concept for the two of the issues above:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use cgc::mem::Ptr;
use std::rc::Rc;

fn wild_sync() {
    // 1. Wild Send and Sync
    let rc = Rc::new(42);
    let ptr = Ptr::new(rc.clone());

    std::thread::spawn(move || {
        let smuggled_rc = ptr.take();

        println!("Thread: {:p}", smuggled_rc);
        for _ in 0..100_000_000 {
            smuggled_rc.clone();
        }
    });

    println!("Main:   {:p}", rc);
    for _ in 0..100_000_000 {
        rc.clone();
    }
}

// A simple tagged union used to demonstrate problems with aliasing.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum RefOrInt { Ref(&'static u64), Int(u64) }

fn aliasing() {
    // 2. Aliasing violation
    let ptr = Ptr::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&42));

    let mutable_ref_one = ptr.get();
    let mutable_ref_two = ptr.get();

    println!("Pointer points to: {:?}", mutable_ref_one);
    if let RefOrInt::Ref(ref addr) = mutable_ref_one {
        *mutable_ref_two = RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef);

        println!("Pointer now points to: {:p}", *addr);
        println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", **addr);
    }
}

fn main() {
    wild_sync();
    aliasing();
}
```

This outputs:

```
Pointer points to: Ref(42)
Pointer now points to: 0xdeadbeef

Terminated with signal 11 (SIGSEGV)

```
