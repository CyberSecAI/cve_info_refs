Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2020-36468**.

**Root Cause:**
The `cgc` crate's `Ptr` type has multiple soundness issues stemming from incorrect implementations of `Send`, `Sync`, `get`, and `write` methods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Incorrect `Send` and `Sync` Implementation:** The `Ptr` type implements `Send` and `Sync` for all types `T`, regardless of whether `T` is actually thread-safe. This allows non-thread-safe types like `Rc` and `Cell` to be sent across threads, potentially leading to data races.
2.  **Mutable Aliasing Violation:** The `Ptr::get` method takes a reference and returns a mutable reference. This allows the creation of multiple mutable references to the same object, violating Rust's aliasing rules and resulting in undefined behavior.
3.  **Non-Atomic Writes:** The `Ptr::write` method uses non-atomic writes to the underlying pointer. When used across threads, this can lead to data races.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to data races, memory corruption, undefined behavior, and potentially a denial of service. Specifically, the provided proof of concept demonstrates:
    *   Data races when sending non-thread-safe types across threads.
    *   The creation of multiple mutable references, causing a segmentation fault when dereferenced after mutation.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by using the `Ptr` type in a multithreaded context or by creating and using multiple mutable references via the `get` method, as shown in the proof-of-concept.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to introduce and use the vulnerable `cgc` crate in their Rust application. No special privileges are required. The attack complexity is rated as high because the attacker would need to use the library in a way that triggers the concurrency or aliasing issues.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The affected versions of the `cgc` crate are `<= 0.4.0`.
*   No patches were available at the time of this report, indicating the crate might be abandoned.
*   The severity is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 5.9.
*   The weakness is categorized under CWE-657 (Improper Handling of Syntactic Elements) and CWE-362 (Race Condition)
* This issue is related to CVE-2020-36466 and CVE-2020-36467
