The provided content is related to CVE-2020-36631.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an SQL injection caused by embedding an unsanitized string directly into an SQL query within the `update_profile` function in the `gamespy/gs_database.py` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The code directly embeds user-provided input (`field[0]`) into the SQL query string without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code through the `field` parameter.
- This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, or potentially complete database compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through the `update_profile` function, which takes `profileid` and `field` as parameters.
- The attacker needs to control the `field` parameter to inject malicious SQL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to call the `update_profile` function and control the `field` parameter. This requires access to the application's interface where this function can be triggered.
- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the application using the vulnerable function.
