Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-36426:

**Root Cause:**

*   A 1-byte buffer over-read exists in the `mbedtls_x509_crl_parse_der()` function.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**

*   A buffer over-read occurs due to improper bounds checking within the `mbedtls_x509_crl_parse_der()` function while parsing a DER-encoded X.509 Certificate Revocation List (CRL).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The impact is a 1-byte over-read, which might lead to a crash or potentially expose sensitive data, depending on how the memory is allocated and used in the application. The provided information does not elaborate further on this.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted X.509 CRL to the `mbedtls_x509_crl_parse_der()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious CRL. This could be achieved through a network connection or a compromised system that uses the library.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit this issue.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found by OSS-Fuzz and pinpointed by Philippe Antoine.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in mbedtls versions 2.24.0, 2.16.8, and 2.7.17.
*   The fix involves correcting the parsing logic to prevent the over-read.
