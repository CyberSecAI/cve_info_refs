- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Veritas System Recovery (VSR) application attempts to load the OpenSSL library from `\usr\local\ssl` and a configuration file `openssl.cnf` from within the same directory. This directory and file do not exist by default, but can be created by a low-privileged user. The openssl.cnf file, if created, can be used to load a malicious OpenSSL engine, resulting in arbitrary code execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insecure library loading: The application loads OpenSSL library and a configuration file from a path that can be created by a low-privileged user.
    - Arbitrary code execution: By crafting a malicious OpenSSL engine and referencing it in the openssl.cnf file, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges, allowing the attacker to gain full administrative control of the affected system.
    - Access to all data and installed applications on the system.
    - If the system is an Active Directory domain controller, it could affect the entire domain.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Local: A local attacker with low privileges can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Low-privileged access to the Windows system.
    - Ability to create directories and files under the `C:\` path.
    - Ability to craft a malicious OpenSSL engine and configuration file.
