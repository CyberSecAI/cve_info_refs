Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36154:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `VUEApplicationWrapper` service has an unquoted service path, specifically: `C:\Pearson VUE\VUE TestingSystem\bin\VUEWrapper.exe`.
*   Insecure file permissions exist on the `C:\Pearson VUE` directory, allowing any user to write to this directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unquoted Service Path:** The service path `C:\Pearson VUE\VUE TestingSystem\bin\VUEWrapper.exe` is not enclosed in quotation marks. This allows an attacker to insert a malicious executable in an earlier part of the path, such as `C:\Pearson VUE\VUE.exe` which will then be executed by the service. This is due to how Windows parses service paths, it will execute `C:\Pearson.exe`, then `C:\Pearson VUE\VUE.exe` and so on.
*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The `C:\Pearson VUE` directory has "Everyone" with "Full Control" permissions. This allows any user on the system to write/modify files in the directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An unauthorized local user can exploit the unquoted service path vulnerability and insecure file permissions to gain privileges of the `VUEService` user, which has administrative rights. By placing a malicious executable in the directory and then restarting the service, the malicious executable will be executed with the service's rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable Pearson Vue software is installed.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to write/modify files in the `C:\Pearson VUE` directory, which is possible due to the insecure file permissions.
*  **Service Restart:** The attacker needs to restart the `VUEApplicationWrapper` service, or reboot the machine, for the exploit to trigger.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a local user with the ability to write to the `C:\Pearson VUE` directory. This means the attacker could be anyone who is able to login to the target system.
*   The attacker needs a way to execute commands on the system (e.g., via command prompt, PowerShell).
*   The attacker must have the ability to create a malicious executable and place it within the vulnerable directory.

**Additional Details (from Exploit-DB):**

*   The vulnerability was discovered on 2020-09-14.
*   The vulnerable version is Pearson Vue VTS 2.3.1911.
*   The exploit involves creating a malicious `VUE.exe` and placing it into the `C:\Pearson VUE\` directory
*   The provided exploit script uses `certutil.exe` to download the malicious payload

**Note:** While the provided text mentions CVE-2020-36154 in the title, the Exploit-DB entry (49143) does not list a CVE number, and simply states "N/A" for CVE.
