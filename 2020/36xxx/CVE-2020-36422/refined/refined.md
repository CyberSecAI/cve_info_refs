Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36422:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a side-channel issue in the `mbedtls_ecp_check_pub_priv()`, `mbedtls_pk_parse_key()`, `mbedtls_pk_parse_keyfile()`, `mbedtls_ecp_mul()`, and `mbedtls_ecp_mul_restartable()` functions within the Mbed TLS library. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when loading a private key that did not include the uncompressed public key or when calling `mbedtls_ecp_mul` or `mbedtls_ecp_mul_restartable` with a NULL f_rng argument.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Side-channel vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a side-channel issue that can leak sensitive information through timing and memory access patterns.
*   **Insecure key handling:** The vulnerable functions fail to properly handle cases where private keys are loaded without corresponding uncompressed public keys.
*   **Insecure RNG usage:** The vulnerable functions do not properly handle cases where a null RNG argument is passed.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker with precise timing and memory access information can fully recover the ECC private key. This is particularly dangerous in scenarios like secure enclaves, where an untrusted OS may be able to attack the secure enclave.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Timing attacks:** An attacker needs to be able to measure the timing of operations performed by the vulnerable functions.
*   **Memory access analysis:** The attacker needs to be able to observe the memory access patterns of the vulnerable functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to precise enough timing and memory access information. This typically requires the attacker to have control over the operating system or environment where the vulnerable code is running, such as in the case of an untrusted operating system attacking a secure enclave.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability affects mbedtls versions 2.16.7 and 2.23.0.
* The vulnerability was found and reported by Alejandro Cabrera Aldaya and Billy Brumley.
* The fix involves addressing the side-channel issues in the affected functions.
* The mbedtls library has released updated versions that address this vulnerability.
