Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-36701:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the lack of proper access controls and input validation in the KingComposer WordPress plugin, particularly within its AJAX actions and shortcode handling. The plugin relies on a nonce for security checks, but this nonce is leaked in the page source and used in multiple AJAX endpoints. Additionally, several shortcodes don't properly sanitize attributes, allowing for injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin leaks a security nonce, allowing any authenticated user (including subscribers) to perform actions intended for higher-level users.
*   **Arbitrary WordPress Options Change:** The `kc_update_option` AJAX action allows modification of any WordPress option, enabling attackers to, for example, enable registration with administrator default role, or redirect all traffic to an external malicious website.
*  **Arbitrary File/Folder Deletion:** The `kc_installed_extensions` AJAX action allows deletion of arbitrary files and directories due to insufficient path validation.
*  **Content Injection:** The `kc_push_section` AJAX action allows modification of any page or post content. The attacker can either replace or append the new content to the existing one. Additionally, `kc_load_section` allows attackers to view any page/post even if private or password-protected.
*   **Stored XSS via Shortcode:** Several shortcodes fail to properly escape attributes, enabling injection of malicious JavaScript via crafted shortcodes, leading to stored XSS. Specifically, the `kc_row_inner` shortcode is vulnerable to javascript injection via the `column_align` attribute.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The plugin's extension upload functionality within the `process_bulk_action` function doesn't validate uploaded file types, allowing authors and editors to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a ZIP archive with a PHP file inside.
*  **Arbitrary File/Folder Deletion:** The `bulk-delete` action also allows deleting arbitrary files/folders by specifying a relative path via the `checked[]` POST array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Website Takeover:** Through the combination of options modification, content injection, and RCE, an attacker can gain complete control over a vulnerable website, including creating administrator accounts, modifying website content, and executing arbitrary code.
*   **Data Loss:** Arbitrary file/folder deletion can lead to significant data loss and website malfunction.
*   **Malware Distribution:** RCE can be used to inject malicious code into the website, which can then infect visitors.
*   **User Compromise:** XSS can be used to steal user session cookies or redirect users to phishing pages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Actions:** Exploitation occurs through maliciously crafted AJAX requests to vulnerable endpoints (`kc_update_option`, `kc_installed_extensions`, `kc_push_section`, `kc_load_section`, `process_bulk_action`).
*   **Shortcodes:** The stored XSS is triggered via a crafted shortcode inserted into post content.
*  **File Upload**: RCE is achieved by uploading a malicious zip archive containing a PHP script via the extension upload functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The vulnerabilities involving AJAX actions require an attacker to have a valid WordPress account (at least a subscriber for options change, content injection and arbitrary file deletion, and at least author level for the RCE vulnerability). The XSS vulnerability requires a logged in user to view the page with the crafted shortcode.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable AJAX actions and the parameters used by these endpoints.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The plugin was closed in the WordPress plugin repository due to security issues and is no longer available for download.
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed in version 2.9.4 of the plugin.
