The Page Builder: KingComposer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Uploads in versions up to, and including, 2.9.3 via the 'process_bulk_action' function in the 'kingcomposer/includes/kc.extensions.php' file. This makes it possible for authenticated users with author level permissions and above to upload arbitrary files onto the server which can be used to execute code on the server.
