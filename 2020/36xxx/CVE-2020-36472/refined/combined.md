Hello fellow Rustacean,

we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) found a memory-safety/soundness issue in this crate while scanning Rust code on crates.io for potential vulnerabilities.

## Issue Description

[max7301/src/expander/immediate.rs](https://github.com/edarc/max7301/blob/a2084de5ea1242c0fe1a143fd1719733964735a2/src/expander/immediate.rs#L23-L28)

Lines 23 to 28
in
[a2084de](/edarc/max7301/commit/a2084de5ea1242c0fe1a143fd1719733964735a2)

|  | unsafe impl<M, EI> Sync for ImmediateIO<M, EI> |
| --- | --- |
|  | where |
|  | M: IOMutex<Expander<EI>>, |
|  | EI: ExpanderInterface, |
|  | { |
|  | } |

[max7301/src/expander/transactional.rs](https://github.com/edarc/max7301/blob/a2084de5ea1242c0fe1a143fd1719733964735a2/src/expander/transactional.rs#L65-L70)

Lines 65 to 70
in
[a2084de](/edarc/max7301/commit/a2084de5ea1242c0fe1a143fd1719733964735a2)

|  | unsafe impl<M, EI> Sync for TransactionalIO<M, EI> |
| --- | --- |
|  | where |
|  | M: IOMutex<Expander<EI>>, |
|  | EI: ExpanderInterface, |
|  | { |
|  | } |

`ImmediateIO` and `TransactionIO` implement `Sync` for `M: IOMutex<Expander<EI>>, EI: ExpanderInterface`. This bound is seemingly unsound; it allows to send a reference of `ImmediateIO` or `TransactionIO` to another thread, and from there a mutable reference of `Expander<EI>` can be accessed through `IOMutex` APIs. This could result in a thread-safety violation when `EI` is a non-Send type.

We suggest to add an `Expander<EI>: Send` bound (or an equivalent `EI: Send` bound) to those `Sync` implementations, following [the stdlib Mutex's Sync implementation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html#impl-Sync).

## Description

The `ImmediateIO` and `TransactionalIO` types implement `Sync` for all contained

`Expander<EI>` types regardless of if the `Expander` itself is safe to use

across threads.

As the `IO` types allow retrieving the `Expander`, this can lead to non-thread

safe types being sent across threads as part of the `Expander` leading to data

races.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
