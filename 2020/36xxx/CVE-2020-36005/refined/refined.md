The provided content describes a vulnerability in the `appcms` application where an authenticated user can delete arbitrary files on the server.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `del_resource` function within `core/function.php` and how it's called in `dawn/app.php`. The application does not properly restrict the file paths passed to this function, allowing a user with administrative privileges to delete any file on the server that the webserver process has permissions to access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary file deletion:** The application allows for deleting any file through the `del_resource` function.
- **Insufficient input validation:** The application lacks proper validation on the resource parameter passed to the `del_resource` function, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.
- **Lack of access control:** The authorization mechanism requires that the user be logged in to access the vulnerable function, however, it does not check if the logged-in user should have access to such a destructive functionality or restrict which files can be deleted.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data loss:** Attackers can delete any file from the server, including application code, configuration files, and uploaded files.
- **Denial of Service:** Deletion of essential files can render the application unusable.
- **Potential complete compromise of the server:**  Depending on the server configuration and access rights, the attacker can potentially delete system files and achieve complete compromise of the system, if the webserver process has enough privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the server's admin interface after logging in, with specific parameters such as 'm' set to 'resource', and 'a' set to 'del', with the `resource` parameter containing the path to the file which needs to be deleted.
- **Web interface:** The vulnerable functionality is accessed through the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user:** An attacker must have valid login credentials to access the admin interface.
- **Basic knowledge of web requests:** An attacker needs to understand how to manipulate POST requests (e.g., via tools like Burp Suite) to send the malicious request to the server.
