# Critical Vulnerabilities Patched in Adning Advertising Plugin

On June 24, 2020, our Threat Intelligence team was made aware of a possible vulnerability in the Adning Advertising plugin, a premium plugin with over 8,000 customers. We eventually discovered 2 vulnerabilities, one of which was a critical vulnerability that allowed an unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files, leading to Remote Code Execution(RCE), which could allow complete site takeover.

The next day, on June 25, 2020, we privately disclosed these vulnerabilities to the plugin’s author, Tunafish. A patched version was made available in less than 24 hours, on June 26, 2020. We strongly recommend updating to the latest version of this plugin, 1.5.6, immediately.

Wordfence Premium users received a firewall rule protecting against these vulnerabilities on June 25, 2020. Users still running the free version of Wordfence will receive this rule on July 25, 2020.

After monitoring attacks against this firewall rule, we determined that, although these vulnerabilities were being attacked in the wild, the attacks were extremely limited in scope and scale. As such we withheld details from public disclosure for a short period of time to allow users time to update and prevent more widespread exploitation.

**Description**: Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload leading to Remote Code Execution

**Affected Plugin**: [Adning Advertising](https://codecanyon.net/item/wp-pro-advertising-system-all-in-one-ad-manager/269693)

**Plugin Slug**: angwp

**Affected Versions**: < 1.5.6

**CVE ID**: N/A

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**CVSS score**: 10.0(critical)

**Patched Version**: 1.5.6

One functionality of the Adning plugin is to allow users to upload banner images. In order to provide this functionality, it used an AJAX action, `_ning_upload_image`. Unfortunately this AJAX action was available with a `nopriv_` hook, meaning that any visitor to the site could make use of it, even if they were not logged in. Additionally, the function called by this AJAX action also failed to make use of a capability check or a nonce check.

```
	public static function _ning_upload_image()
	{
		$_action = isset($_POST['action']) ? $_POST['action'] : '';
		$user_id = isset($_POST['uid']) ? $_POST['uid'] : 0;
		$banner_id = isset($_POST['bid']) ? $_POST['bid'] : 0;
		$max_upload_size = isset($_POST['max_upload_size']) ? $_POST['max_upload_size'] : 100;
		$upload = isset($_POST['upload']) ?  json_decode(stripslashes($_POST['upload']), true) : array();
		$valid_formats = isset($_POST['allowed_file_types']) ? explode(',', $_POST['allowed_file_types']) : array('jpg');
		if( in_array('jpg', $valid_formats) )
		{
			$valid_formats[] = 'jpeg';
		}

		//$max_file_size = 1024*100; //100 kb
		//$max_file_size = 1024000*15; // 15 MB (1 mb = 1000 kb)
		$max_file_size = 1024000*$max_upload_size;

		//$upload_path = $upload_dir.'/'.$upload_folder;
		//$upload_path = $upload_path.$upload_folder;
		$upload_path = $upload['dir'].$upload['folder'];
		$count = 0;

		// Create upload folder if not exists
		if(!is_dir($upload_path)) {
		    mkdir($upload_path, 0777, true);
		}

		if(!empty($_FILES['files']))
		{
			$upload_success = false;
			$upload_error = '';
			$uploaded_files = array();
			$unzip_error = array();

			// Loop $_FILES to execute all files
			foreach ($_FILES['files']['name'] as $f => $name)
			{
			    if ($_FILES['files']['error'][$f] == 4)
			    {
			        continue; // Skip file if any error found
			    }
			    if ($_FILES['files']['error'][$f] == 0)
			    {
			        if ($_FILES['files']['size'][$f] > $max_file_size)
			        {
			            $upload_error = $name. " is too large!";
			            continue; // Skip large files
			        }
					elseif( !in_array(pathinfo($name, PATHINFO_EXTENSION), $valid_formats) )
					{
						$upload_error = $name." is not a valid format";
						continue; // Skip invalid file formats
					}
			        else
			        {
			        	// No error found! Move uploaded files
			            if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES["files"]["tmp_name"][$f], $upload_path.$name)){
			            	$count++; // Number of successfully uploaded file
							$src = $upload['src'].$upload['folder'].$name;

			            	// Copy image to banner folder
			            	/*if(!empty($banner_id))
			        		{

								}
			        			copy($path.$name, $upload_dir.'/'.$banner_folder.$name);

			        		$uploaded_files[] = array(
			        			'name' => $name,

								'upload' => $upload,

							if( pathinfo($name, PATHINFO_EXTENSION) == 'zip')
							{
								$zipfile = array(
									'name' => $_FILES['files']['name'][$f],
									'type' => $_FILES['files']['type'][$f],
									'tmp_name' => $_FILES['files']['tmp_name'][$f],
									'error' => $_FILES['files']['error'][$f],
									'size' => $_FILES['files']['size'][$f],
								);

								$unzip_error = self::upload_and_unzip($zipfile, array('folder' => $upload['folder'], 'path' => $upload_path, 'src' => $upload['src']));
							}
						}
						else
						{
							$upload_error = is_writable($upload_path) ? 'Could not move files.' : 'Folder is not writable.';
						}
			        }
			    }
			}

			if(count($uploaded_files) > 0){
				$upload_success = true;
			}

			echo json_encode(array("chk" => $_FILES['files'], "unzip" => $unzip_error, "upload" => $upload, "success" => $upload_success, "files" => json_encode($uploaded_files), "error" => $upload_error));
		}else{
			echo 'no files found.';
		}
		exit;
	}
```

This function also allowed the user to supply the “allowed” file types. As such it was possible for an unauthenticated attacker to upload malicious code by sending a `POST` request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `_ning_upload_image` the `allowed_file_types` set to `php`, and a `files` parameter containing a malicious PHP file. Alternatively, an attacker could set the `allowed_file_types` to `zip` and upload a compressed archive containing a malicious PHP file, which would be unzipped after upload. It was also possible for an attacker to change the upload directory by manipulating the contents of the `upload` parameter – if the desired directory did not exist, the plugin would create it.

**Description**: Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion via path traversal

**Affected Plugin**: [Adning Advertising](https://codecanyon.net/item/wp-pro-advertising-system-all-in-one-ad-manager/269693)

**Plugin Slug**: angwp

**Affected Versions**: < 1.5.6

**CVE ID**: N/A

**CVSS Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H)

**CVSS score**: 8.7(high)

**Patched Version**: 1.5.6

In order to delete any uploaded images, the plugin also registered another ajax action, `_ning_remove_image`, which also used a `nopriv_` hook. As with the upload vulnerability, this function did not perform a capability check or a nonce check. As such it was possible for an unauthenticated attacker to delete arbitrary files using path traversal.

If an attacker were able to delete `wp-config.php`, the site would be reset, and an attacker could then set it up again and point it to a remote database under their control, effectively replacing the site’s content with their own content.

```
	public static function _ning_remove_image()
	{
		$upload = wp_upload_dir();
		$upload_dir = $upload['basedir'];
		$upload_url = $upload['baseurl'];
		$upload_folder = self::$upload_folder.$_POST['uid'].'/';

		$path = $upload_dir.'/'.$upload_folder.basename($_POST['src']);
		$removed = 0;

		if(unlink($path)){
			$remove = 1;
		}
		echo $remove;

		exit;
	}
```

This attack might require an extra step of preparation, which is that the `wp-content/uploads/path` folder would need to exist. However, since the previously mentioned arbitrary file upload vulnerability allowed for directory creation, this was not a major obstacle. Once the directory was created, an attacker could send a `POST` request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `_ning_remove_image`, the `uid` parameter set to `/../../..` and the `src` parameter set to `wp-config.php`.

## Timeline

**June 24, 2020** – Wordfence Threat Intelligence receives a report of a compromised website running the Adning plugin. During our investigation, we discovered two vulnerabilities.

**June 25, 2020** – Firewall rule released for Premium Wordfence users. We make initial contact with plugin’s author and send full disclosure after receiving a response.

**June 26, 2020** – Plugin’s author releases a patch.

**July 25, 2020** – Firewall rule becomes available to Wordfence free users.

## Conclusion

In today’s post, we discussed two vulnerabilities in the Adning Advertising plugin which could allow an attacker to completely take over a website. These flaws have been fully patched in version 1.5.6. If you are running this plugin, it is critical that you updated to this version as soon as possible. Sites running [Wordfence Premium](https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-signup/?promo_id=blog20200708&promo_name=get-premium&promo_creative=txt&promo_position=conclusion) have been protected against these vulnerabilities since June 25, 2020, while sites still using the free version of Wordfence will receive the firewall rule on July 25, 2020.

*Special Thanks to Tunafish, the author of the Adning Advertising plugin, for their excellent and timely response in releasing a patch.*

# Critical vulnerability in Adning Advertising plugin actively exploited in the wild.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [July 7, 2020 - 6:14pm [+0700]July 7, 2020 - 6:24pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/critical-vulnerability-in-adning-advertising-plugin-actively-exploited-in-the-wild/)

A critical vulnerability in the WordPress [Adning Advertising](https://codecanyon.net/item/wp-pro-advertising-system-all-in-one-ad-manager/269693) plugin (8k+ installations) is currently actively exploited in the wild. It affects version 1.5.5 and below. A new version 1.5.6 was released on June 26th, 2020:

![](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/adning-advertising-vulnerability.png)

The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to upload any file via the WordPress AJAX API.

We have seen several hacked websites lately. It’s unclear yet if the plugin was patched because it was already exploited (zero-day) or if hackers detected the vulnerability after it was patched and publicly released, but the attack has been going on for at least a week or so.

### Recommendations

Upgrade immediately if you have version 1.5.5 or below. If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.
