Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36728:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Adning Advertising plugin contains two distinct vulnerabilities:
1.  **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload:** The plugin's AJAX action `_ning_upload_image` was accessible to unauthenticated users due to the `nopriv_` hook, and lacked capability and nonce checks. This allowed arbitrary file uploads.
2.  **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion:** The plugin's AJAX action `_ning_remove_image` was also accessible to unauthenticated users, lacked capability and nonce checks, and was vulnerable to path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   Lack of access control on the AJAX endpoint `_ning_upload_image`.
    *   Missing capability and nonce checks.
    *   Ability to specify allowed file types, including malicious ones such as `php` or `zip`
    *   Ability to manipulate the upload directory by controlling the `upload` parameter.
2.  **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion:**
    *   Lack of access control on the AJAX endpoint `_ning_remove_image`.
    *   Missing capability and nonce checks.
    *   Path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of the `src` parameter, allowing deletion of files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) by uploading malicious PHP files.
    *   Complete site takeover.
2. **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion:**
    *   Arbitrary file deletion, including critical files like `wp-config.php` which could lead to site reset and takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   Sending a `POST` request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `_ning_upload_image` along with other necessary parameters.
2.  **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion:**
    *   Sending a `POST` request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `_ning_remove_image` and other necessary parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated:** Attackers do not need any login credentials.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers must be able to send HTTP requests to the target website.

**Additional Notes:**
* The file upload vulnerability could be exploited by uploading a zip file containing malicious code, which would be unzipped after upload
* The file deletion vulnerability could be exploited to delete `wp-config.php`, effectively resetting the site and allowing takeover.
* The file deletion vulnerability may require the attacker to use the file upload vulnerability to create a directory first.
* The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild.
* The vulnerability was patched in version 1.5.6 of the Adning Advertising plugin.
