Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-36712:

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary vulnerability stems from the lack of authorization checks in the `kaliforms_form_delete_uploaded_file` AJAX action. This allows unauthenticated users to trigger the `delete_file` function.
*   The `delete_file` function, in turn, uses the value provided in `$_POST['id']` to call `wp_delete_post` without proper validation or user permission checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post Deletion:** The most significant vulnerability is that any user, even those not logged in, can delete any post or page on the WordPress site.
*   **Missing Authorization:** The AJAX action `kaliforms_form_delete_uploaded_file` lacks any privilege or user protection, making it accessible to unauthenticated users.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The `delete_file` function directly uses a user-supplied ID to delete a post, without proper validation or authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Site Data Loss:** An attacker can delete all posts and pages on the WordPress site, effectively causing data loss and significant disruption.
*   **Site Defacement:** Deleting content can render a site unusable, impacting its functionality and reputation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct AJAX Call:** The attacker sends a direct AJAX request to `wp_ajax_kaliforms_form_delete_uploaded_file` with a crafted `id` parameter corresponding to the post they wish to delete.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have a user account on the WordPress site or to be logged in.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target website.
