Fixes [#334](https://github.com/rl-institut/NESP2/issues/334)

`wget "http://<host_name>/csv-export?state=Edo&cluster_type=ogcluster&ogmin_area=0;SELECT PG_SLEEP(10)--&ogmax_area=10&ogmindtg=0&ogmaxdtg=100&ogminb=0&ogmaxb=10000&ogminbfp=0&ogmaxbfp=100"`

should return a 500 error

`wget "http://<host_name>/csv-export?state=Edo;SELECT PG_SLEEP(10)--&cluster_type=ogcluster&ogmin_area=0&ogmax_area=10&ogmindtg=0&ogmaxdtg=100&ogminb=0&ogmaxb=10000&ogminbfp=0&ogmaxbfp=100"`

should both return 200 and an empty csv file

Sorry, something went wrong.

Hi,

just passing by, but noticed (at least one) sql injection issue in

[NESP2/app/database.py](https://github.com/rl-institut/NESP2/blob/a82e6ce7ae6e81b2a1e08a31858399839c0fdf81/app/database.py#L66)

Line 66

[a82e6ce](/rl-institut/NESP2/commit/a82e6ce7ae6e81b2a1e08a31858399839c0fdf81)

|  | def filter\_materialized\_view( |
| --- | --- |

user-controlled data is used without escaping in a raw sql query. I suggest either to use the orm layer, or maybe one of
```
table = Table('table', metadata, autoload = True, autoload_with = engine)
s=table.select().where(Column('blub') == usercontrolled1).where(Column('muh') == usercontrolled2)

```

or

```
filter=['blub = :value1', 'blub2 = :value1']
values={'value1':usercontrolled1,'value2':usercontrolled2}
sql = 'select * from table where' + 'and'.join(filter)
result = connection.execute(sql, **values)

```

should make sqlalchemy escape the input.

The severity of this issue depends on the sql server configuration, I don't want to set up a local test environment

Protect user input against sql injection

```
All fields which are provided by the user are now checked
converted to numerical values in python to prevent
SQL injection.

Best would be to use ORM, but SQLAlchemy does not handle it
great for materialized views, and I wanted to patch the
vulnerability asap
