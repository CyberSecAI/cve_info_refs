Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the direct inclusion of user-controlled data into a raw SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the `filter_materialized_view` function in `app/database.py` constructs a SQL query by directly embedding user-provided values for filtering conditions like `area`, `distance_grid`, `building`, and `buildingfp` into the SQL string.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By crafting malicious input within the URL parameters, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or even complete database compromise.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Data breach:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive data from the database.
- **Data modification:** An attacker could modify or delete existing data in the database.
- **Denial of service:** An attacker could potentially overload or crash the database.
- **Privilege escalation:** Depending on the database user's permissions, the attacker might be able to gain higher privileges within the database server.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP GET request parameters:** The attack vector is the HTTP GET request parameters in the `/csv-export` endpoint. The attacker can modify the URL to inject malicious SQL code through the parameters that are used in the `filter_materialized_view` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Access to the application's HTTP endpoint:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, typically over the network.
- **Basic understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft a malicious SQL injection payload.
- **No authentication required:** Based on the information provided, there is no mention of authentication requirements for accessing this endpoint.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was identified in the `NESP2` project.
- The vulnerable code was located in the `app/database.py` file, specifically in the `filter_materialized_view` function.
- A fix was implemented by converting user-provided parameters to numerical values in python before using them in the query. However, the commit message suggests that using an ORM would have been a better solution but was not done due to time constraints and issues with materialized view handling. The fix was implemented in commit `07c0cdf36cf6a4345086d07b54423723a496af5e`.
- Example malicious URLs demonstrate the potential for SQL injection through parameters like `state`, and other filter parameters.
