Based on the provided content, there is a direct match related to CVE-2020-36558, specifically concerning the fix for a race condition in the `vt_ioctl` function.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists in the `vt_ioctl` function when handling `VT_RESIZEX` ioctl requests. The code accesses `vc_cons[i].d` after acquiring the `console_lock()` without checking for `NULL`, which can lead to a null pointer dereference and a crash.
- The root cause is that the vc\_cons array might contain null pointers. After acquiring the console\_lock, there might be a delay in assigning non-null values to array entries, leading to usage of null pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference due to missing check for `NULL` before accessing the `d` member of the `vc_cons[i]` structure after acquiring `console_lock()`.
- Race condition due to asynchronous access to the vc\_cons array entries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash due to null pointer dereference.
- General protection fault, leading to system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- By sending a specially crafted `VT_RESIZEX` ioctl request using a user-space application while also performing operations that change the contents of the vc\_cons array (e.g. creating and deleting consoles).
- Specifically, triggering the ioctl while the  `vc_cons[i].d` value is `NULL` after console\_lock is grabbed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to make system calls, specifically the `ioctl` syscall.
- The ability to manipulate console state or trigger a specific timing of events, in order to race with console initialization or de-initialization that result in the race condition.
- Needs to be a local user with access to a TTY.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix involves adding a check for `NULL` before accessing members of `vc_cons[i].d` within a conditional, and using a local variable for `vc_cons[i].d` to avoid potential race conditions after a null check.
