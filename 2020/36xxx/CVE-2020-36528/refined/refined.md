{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The server-side component of Platinum Mobile does not properly validate the user's permissions based on the 'UserCode' extracted from the message. Instead, it trusts and uses the parameters within the message body as the real reference to the business data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Broken Access Control",
    "Insufficient authorization checks on user data access"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated attacker can disclose sensitive information such as company payroll and personal information of other employees, potentially including higher-ranked managers.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious XML message with modified parameters (e.g., a different user's ID) while using their own valid 'UserCode' and 'TokenID' to generate the message hash. This crafted message is then sent to the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Platinum Mobile application."
