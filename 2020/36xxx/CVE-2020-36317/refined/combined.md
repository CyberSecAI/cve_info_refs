## Description

![@SkiFire13](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9020423?u=d0ce7486e9b05e2564d23eca411832e5eda37383&v=4&size=48)[SkiFire13](https://github.com/SkiFire13)opened [on Oct 28, 2020](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78498#issue-731720421)

While `String::retain` executes it may temporarily leave the `String` in an inconsistent state, in particular it may contain invalid utf8. This is safe because it restores this invariant before returning, but the caller may skip this by panicing inside the closure and catching the unwind it outside. This allows to create `String`s that are not utf8, breaking the library invariant without using `unsafe`.

For example the following will panic at the final assertion, while I would expect it to never fail when `s` has type `String`:

```
let mut s = "0è0".to_string();
let _ = std::panic::catch_unwind(std::panic::AssertUnwindSafe(|| {
    let mut count = 0;
    s.retain(|_| {
        count += 1;
        match count {
            1 => false,
            2 => true,
            _ => panic!(),
        }
    });
}));
assert!(std::str::from_utf8(s.as_bytes()).is_ok()); // This will fail
```

Fixes [#78498](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78498)

The idea is the same as `Vec::drain`, set the len to 0 so that nobody can observe the broken invariant if it escapes the function (in this case if `f` panics)

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Can you add a test that fails without this change, but passes with?  Done. I added it in the same function of the other tests for `String::retain`. Is that ok or should I make it separate?  A test for `s.retain(|_| true)` would also be good, since I don't think the existing tests caught that bug  There's already a test for that, which in fact initially failed in the CI. The reason I didn't catch it before opening the pull request is that I naively ran `./x.py test library/std` expecting it to also test `alloc`, but to be fair the rustc book is pretty misleading about that. |

[@RalfJung](https://github.com/RalfJung) this was brought to my attention by [@DJMcNab](https://github.com/DJMcNab) (the author of [`retain_more`](https://github.com/DJMcNab/retain_more)), as somewhat suspicious - it's calling `get_unchecked` on a `&str` obtained via auto-deref **which is zero-length now**. So we more or less expect this needs to go through a raw pointer directly or something similar.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Good catch! I guess another fix would be using a `DropGuard` for setting the length at the end of the loop. This way it's not necessary to set the length to 0 anymore because its `drop` implementation would called even in case of panic.
