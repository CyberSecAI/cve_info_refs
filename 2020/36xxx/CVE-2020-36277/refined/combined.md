Name : leptonica
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 1.80.0
Release : 3.fc32
URL : <https://github.com/danbloomberg/leptonica>
Summary : C library for efficient image processing and image analysis operations
Description :
The library supports many operations that are useful on
\* Document images
\* Natural images

Fundamental image processing and image analysis operations
\* Rasterop (aka bitblt)
\* Affine transforms (scaling, translation, rotation, shear)
on images of arbitrary pixel depth
\* Projective and bi-linear transforms
\* Binary and gray scale morphology, rank order filters, and
convolution
\* Seed-fill and connected components
\* Image transformations with changes in pixel depth, both at
the same scale and with scale change
\* Pixelwise masking, blending, enhancement, arithmetic ops,
etc.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-f5f2803fff

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : leptonica
Product : Fedora 33
Version : 1.80.0
Release : 3.fc33
URL : <https://github.com/danbloomberg/leptonica>
Summary : C library for efficient image processing and image analysis operations
Description :
The library supports many operations that are useful on
\* Document images
\* Natural images

Fundamental image processing and image analysis operations
\* Rasterop (aka bitblt)
\* Affine transforms (scaling, translation, rotation, shear)
on images of arbitrary pixel depth
\* Projective and bi-linear transforms
\* Binary and gray scale morphology, rank order filters, and
convolution
\* Seed-fill and connected components
\* Image transformations with changes in pixel depth, both at
the same scale and with scale change
\* Pixelwise masking, blending, enhancement, arithmetic ops,
etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
