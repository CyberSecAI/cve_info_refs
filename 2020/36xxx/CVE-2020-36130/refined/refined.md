Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36130:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `aom` (AV1 Video Codec Library).
- The root cause involves multiple issues like buffer overflows, use-after-free, and NULL pointer dereferences. These issues occur when processing malformed multimedia files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer overflows:** Improper bounds checking when handling data can lead to writing data beyond the allocated buffer, causing crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Use-after-free:** Memory is accessed after it has been freed, which can lead to crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **NULL pointer dereferences:** Attempting to access memory through a NULL pointer, leading to program crashes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (DoS):** Malformed multimedia files can cause the application to crash.
- **Unspecified impact:** The advisories also mention an unspecified impact, suggesting that in certain conditions, the vulnerabilities could be exploited for purposes other than causing a crash, potentially including arbitrary code execution. The Gentoo advisory explicitly mentions that the worst case scenario is remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a malformed multimedia file.
- This could be achieved by tricking a user into opening a malicious file or via a network service parsing video data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted multimedia file. This can be done either through a network service, local file manipulation or by tricking an user into using it.
- Based on Gentoo's advisory, the vulnerabilities are exploitable locally and remotely.

**Additional notes:**
- Multiple CVEs are referenced which are related to the vulnerabilities in the `libaom` library, including CVE-2020-36130, CVE-2020-36131, CVE-2020-36133, CVE-2020-36135, CVE-2021-30473, CVE-2021-30474 and CVE-2021-30475.
- Patches have been made for Debian stable and oldstable distributions, specifically versions `1.0.0.errata1-3+deb11u1` and `1.0.0-3+deb10u1`, respectively. Gentoo users are advised to upgrade to version 3.2.0 or higher.
