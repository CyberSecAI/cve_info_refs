Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) implementation in the Linux kernel.
*   The core issue is that the FUSE implementation doesn't correctly handle a FUSE server returning invalid attributes for a file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The kernel's FUSE implementation doesn't properly validate the attributes returned by the FUSE server. Specifically, it was found that inconsistent attributes were being returned and the kernel was not handling this situation properly.
*   **Incorrect Error Handling:** When invalid attributes are encountered, the kernel calls `make_bad_inode()`, which sets `inode->i_mode = S_IFREG;`. This incorrectly marks directory inodes as regular files, leading to further issues with dnotify, which doesn't properly handle this situation, eventually causing a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local user who can run a FUSE server can trigger this vulnerability, leading to a kernel crash.
*   **System Crash:** The vulnerability causes a system crash due to incorrect inode handling and dnotify issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local User:**  An attacker must be a local user who is permitted to run a FUSE server.
*   **FUSE Server:** The vulnerability is triggered by a FUSE server returning invalid or inconsistent attributes for a file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
*   The attacker must have the ability to run a FUSE server.
*   The attacker must be able to manipulate the FUSE server to return invalid file attributes.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The specific function in the kernel that is vulnerable is `fuse_do_getattr()`, which is called by the kernel when it needs to get attributes of a file.
*   The fix involves adding a check for a private flag on the fuse inode instead of calling `make_bad_inode()` directly and adding checks to ops, which would have caught bad inodes.
*   The original fix for this vulnerability introduced a different potential denial of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which was also fixed (tracked as CVE-2021-28950).

**Affected Products:**

*   StarWind VSAN Version V8 (build 14338) - vulnerable
*   Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.10.6 - vulnerable
