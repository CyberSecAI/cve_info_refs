## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Jan 24, 2021](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/issues/1932#issue-792926179)

Hi there, we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are scanning crates on crates.io for potential soundness bugs. We noticed that `DeflateOutput`'s implementation of `poll_read` does the following:

[rust-libp2p/protocols/deflate/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/blob/6400719ae9585f7a3620044b8fb3f86d35ef8b22/protocols/deflate/src/lib.rs#L136-L141)

Lines 136 to 141
in
[6400719](/libp2p/rust-libp2p/commit/6400719ae9585f7a3620044b8fb3f86d35ef8b22)

|  | unsafe { |
| --- | --- |
|  | this.read\_interm.reserve(256); |
|  | this.read\_interm.set\_len(this.read\_interm.capacity()); |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | match AsyncRead::poll\_read(Pin::new(&mut this.inner), cx, &mut this.read\_interm) { |

This sets up uninitialized bytes in `read_interm` and then passes it to the user provided `poll_read` method. This allows invoking undefined behavior from safe Rust code, reading uninitialized memory.

This issue is described a bit in the documentation for [`Read`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html#tymethod.read):

> It is your responsibility to make sure that `buf` is initialized before calling read. Calling read with an uninitialized `buf` (of the kind one obtains via `MaybeUninit<T>`) is not safe, and can lead to undefined behavior.

Here's an example that outputs uninitialized memory using this:

#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use libp2p_core::upgrade::{InboundUpgrade, ProtocolName};
use libp2p_deflate::DeflateConfig;

use futures::executor;
use futures::io::{AsyncRead, AsyncReadExt, AsyncWrite, Error};
use futures::task::{Context, Poll};
use std::pin::Pin;

struct BrokenReader();

impl AsyncRead for BrokenReader {
    fn poll_read(
        self: Pin<&mut Self>,
        cx: &mut Context,
        buf: &mut [u8],
    ) -> Poll<Result<usize, Error>> {
        // Dump out uninitialized memory
        println!("{:?}", buf);
        assert!(buf[0] == 0);

        return Poll::Ready(Ok(buf.len()));
    }
}

impl AsyncWrite for BrokenReader {
    fn poll_write(
        self: Pin<&mut Self>,
        cx: &mut Context,
        buf: &[u8],
    ) -> Poll<Result<usize, Error>> {
        return Poll::Ready(Ok(buf.len()));
    }

    fn poll_flush(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context) -> Poll<Result<(), Error>> {
        return Poll::Ready(Ok(()));
    }

    fn poll_close(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context) -> Poll<Result<(), Error>> {
        return Poll::Ready(Ok(()));
    }
}

fn main() {
    executor::block_on(async {
        let broken_reader = BrokenReader();
        let deflate_config = DeflateConfig::default();

        let mut deflate_output = deflate_config
            .upgrade_inbound(broken_reader, "/test/1".as_bytes())
            .await
            .unwrap();

        let mut buf = [1u8; 256];
        deflate_output.read_exact(&mut buf).await.unwrap();
    });
}

# Contents of uninitialized memory exposed in DeflateOutput's AsyncRead implementation
Affected versions of this crate passes an uninitialized buffer to a user-provided trait function `AsyncRead::poll\_read()`.
Arbitrary `AsyncRead::poll\_read()` implementations can read from the uninitialized buffer (memory exposure) and also can return incorrect number of bytes written to the buffer.
Reading from uninitialized memory produces undefined values that can quickly invoke undefined behavior.
The flaw was fixed in commit 5ba266a by ensuring the newly allocated part of the buffer is zero-initialized before passing it to a user-provided `AsyncRead::poll\_read()`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Description

Affected versions of this crate passes an uninitialized buffer to a user-provided trait function `AsyncRead::poll_read()`.

Arbitrary `AsyncRead::poll_read()` implementations can read from the uninitialized buffer (memory exposure) and also can return incorrect number of bytes written to the buffer.
Reading from uninitialized memory produces undefined values that can quickly invoke undefined behavior.

The flaw was fixed in commit 5ba266a by ensuring the newly allocated part of the buffer is zero-initialized before passing it to a user-provided `AsyncRead::poll_read()`.
