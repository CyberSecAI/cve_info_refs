{
  "CVE-2020-36158": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the mwifiex WiFi driver due to a missing length check before calling `memcpy()`, which copies a SSID value. If the SSID value exceeds the maximum allowed length, a buffer overflow occurs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
	  "Lack of Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to denial of service (DoS) or the execution of arbitrary code. It could also lead to disclosure of sensitive information, or addition or modification of data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a crafted, long SSID value to the `mwifiex_cmd_802_11_ad_hoc_start` function."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be local and privileged enough to be able to initiate ad-hoc WIFI network creation."
