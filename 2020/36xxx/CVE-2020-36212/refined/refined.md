Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36212:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `abi_stable` crate before version 0.9.1 used code from the Rust standard library that had known soundness issues, specifically a double drop vulnerability in `DrainFilter` and a bug in `RString::retain` that could create invalid UTF-8 strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Double Drop:** The `DrainFilter` implementation had a double drop vulnerability. This occurs when an object's destructor (the code responsible for cleaning up resources) is called more than once, leading to memory corruption and potentially other undefined behaviors.
*   **Invalid UTF-8 String:** The `RString::retain` function had a bug that could cause it to create an invalid UTF-8 string. This can lead to issues when this string is used, as many Rust functions expect valid UTF-8 data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Availability Impact:** The double drop vulnerability could cause a program to crash, leading to a denial of service (DoS).
*   **Unspecified Impact:** The potential for invalid UTF-8 strings introduces the possibility for unspecified issues, such as incorrect data processing or unexpected behavior in downstream operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, suggesting the vulnerability could potentially be triggered remotely by sending crafted data.
*   **Low Complexity:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires low complexity, indicating that it isn't difficult for an attacker to trigger the vulnerable code path.
*   **No Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any special privileges, making it easier for any attacker to exploit.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability, meaning it can be triggered without tricking a user into performing actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to send a network request that triggers the affected code path in the vulnerable version of the `abi_stable` crate.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5, classified as "HIGH" severity.
*  The `abi_stable` crate corrected these issues in version 0.9.1 by implementing fixes similar to those made in the Rust standard library.
*   The EPSS score of 0.119% indicates that the vulnerability is not frequently exploited in the wild.
*   The issue is tracked under CWE-672.
