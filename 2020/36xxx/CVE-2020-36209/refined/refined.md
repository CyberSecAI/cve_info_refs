Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of the `Sync` trait for the `LateStatic` type in the `late-static` crate. The `Sync` trait is used to indicate that a type is safe to share between threads. The crate incorrectly implemented `Sync` for `LateStatic<T>` when `T` only implemented `Send`, but not `Sync`. This allowed types that are not thread-safe, such as `Cell`, to be used in a multithreaded context through `LateStatic`, leading to data races.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect `Sync` implementation:** The `LateStatic` type was incorrectly marked as `Sync` when the inner type `T` only implemented `Send`.
- **Data race:** Due to the incorrect `Sync` implementation, it became possible to introduce data races when using `LateStatic` in multithreaded applications with non-thread-safe types like `Cell`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory corruption:** The data races could lead to memory corruption due to concurrent modifications of shared data.
- **Undefined behavior:** The memory corruption or other race conditions can result in unpredictable or undefined behavior of the application.
- **Crash:** The provided example shows a scenario where the program crashes with a segmentation fault due to dereferencing corrupted memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is **local**.  An attacker would need to be able to execute code within the context of the application using the vulnerable library. 
- The attack complexity is **high**, as exploiting the vulnerability involves crafting a multi-threaded application that uses the library and triggers the data race.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to write code that uses the vulnerable `late-static` crate.
- The attacker needs to control the types placed inside a `LateStatic` instance such that a non-`Sync` type is introduced.
- The attacker must be able to execute code in a multithreaded environment.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is fixed by changing the `Sync` implementation for `LateStatic<T>` to require that `T` also implements `Sync`, not just `Send`.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.0 (High).
