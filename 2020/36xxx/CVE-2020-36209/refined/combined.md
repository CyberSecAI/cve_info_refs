## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Nov 10, 2020](https://github.com/Richard-W/late-static/issues/1#issue-740237740)

Currently LateStatic implements `Send` and `Sync` unconditionally for all types.

[late-static/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/Richard-W/late-static/blob/3b72ba58df151a821405551358edbe0b015545f3/src/lib.rs#L29-L30)

[3b72ba5](/Richard-W/late-static/commit/3b72ba58df151a821405551358edbe0b015545f3)

|  | unsafe impl<T: Send> core::marker::Send for LateStatic<T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<T: Send> core::marker::Sync for LateStatic<T> {} |

This should probably only be for `Sync` types (this is the same limitation that Rust applies to static types) otherwise there is a soundness issue for multithreaded programs . It is possible to wrap a type that isn't safe to use across threads like `Cell` in a `LateStatic` and then cause data races like so:

```
use late_static::LateStatic;

use std::cell::Cell;
use std::thread;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum RefOrInt<'a> { Ref(&'a u64), Int(u64) }
static SOME_INT: u64 = 123;

static STATIC_CELL: LateStatic<Cell<RefOrInt>> = LateStatic::new();

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        LateStatic::assign(&STATIC_CELL, Cell::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT)));
    }

    thread::spawn(move || {
        loop {
            // Repeatedly write Ref(&addr) and Int(0xdeadbeef) into the cell.
            STATIC_CELL.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
            STATIC_CELL.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
        }
    });

    loop {
        if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = STATIC_CELL.get() {
            // Hope that between the time we pattern match the object as a
            // `Ref`, it gets written to by the other thread.
            if addr as *const u64 == &SOME_INT as *const u64 {
                continue;
            }

            // Due to the data race, obtaining Ref(0xdeadbeef) is possible
            println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
            println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
        }
    }
}
```

This outputs:

```
Pointer is now: 0xdeadbeef

Return Code: -11 (SIGSEGV)

```

## Affected versions

## Patched versions

0.4.0

## Description

Affected versions of this crate implemented Sync for LateStatic with T: Send, so that it is possible to create a data race to a type T: Send + !Sync (e.g. Cell).

This can result in a memory corruption or other kinds of undefined behavior.

The flaw was corrected in commit 11f396c by replacing the T: Send bound to T: Sync bound in the Sync impl for LateStatic.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
