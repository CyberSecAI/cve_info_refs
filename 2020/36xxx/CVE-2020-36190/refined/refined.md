Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability fixed by commit `d72090e`:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the way the `rails_admin` gem handles labels within nested forms, specifically when rendering object labels in tabs for nested associated objects. It was using `.text()` instead of `.html()`, which was causing the HTML special characters to be escaped and displayed as text in the tab instead of being rendered as HTML, as intended. However, when this label is passed via user input, it could introduce arbitrary javascript via HTML tags within a form field label in an admin panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application was vulnerable to reflected XSS via the nested forms.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the application by crafting a specific label containing HTML tags (e.g., `<script>`). This code would then execute within the victim's browser when they view the nested form in the admin panel, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker needs to be able to create a record with malicious HTML in a nested model which is then displayed in the `rails_admin` interface. The vulnerability exists within the `rails_admin` admin panel interface when rendering labels of nested objects, specifically in the tabs generated for nested objects.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to create/edit data, specifically the labels of nested objects, within the application's database. This is usually an authenticated user with specific privileges within the system to interact with nested forms, such as administrative access.

**Additional details:**

*   The commit `d72090e` addresses the XSS vulnerability by changing the way object labels are rendered within the nested form tabs. Instead of using `.text()`, it now uses `.html()` to render the label content.
* The vulnerability is present when the label includes HTML tags that can be executed as JavaScript in the browser.
*   The vulnerability is specifically related to the `ra.nested-form-hooks.js` and `ra.widgets.js` javascript files that manage nested forms behaviour.
* The tests added in the commit ensure that if HTML is entered as input into the label of a nested form it is escaped correctly and not rendered as executable javascript.
*   The comments from other users indicate that GitHub's Dependabot did flag this as a security issue for some users.

**In summary:** This commit addresses a reflected XSS vulnerability in the `rails_admin` gem by changing the way nested object labels are rendered, preventing the execution of malicious HTML code injected into the label fields.
