Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from passing the CageFS authentication token as a command-line argument to the `proxyexec` command. This exposes the token to local users if the `lve_namespaces` service or the virtualized proc filesystem feature is disabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Sensitive information exposure:** Passing the authentication token as a command-line argument makes it visible in the process list.
- **Insufficient process isolation:** When `lve_namespaces` or virtualized procfs is disabled, process information becomes visible to other local users.
- **Lack of secure token handling:** `proxyexec` does not retrieve the token securely from a file or other protected location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege escalation:** An attacker can obtain another user's CageFS token and use it to execute commands as that user.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By using a stolen token, an attacker can potentially create cron jobs or other tasks that lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Data and system compromise:** Once code is executed as another user, the attacker could potentially access sensitive data, modify configurations, or further compromise the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Process list visibility:** The attacker must be able to view the process list (e.g., using `ps aux`).
- **Disabled `lve_namespaces` or virtualized procfs:** The vulnerability is exploitable if the virtualized proc filesystem or `lve_namespaces` service is disabled

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to run commands, like `ps aux`, to view the process list.
- The attacker needs a system where the `lve_namespaces` service or virtualized proc filesystem is disabled.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory on GitHub provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, a proof-of-concept exploit, and recommended countermeasures.
- The vulnerability affects CloudLinux CageFS versions 7.1.1-1 and below.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.1.2-2.
- The suggested fix is to have `proxyexec` directly read the token from `/var/.cagefs/.cagefs.token` instead of relying on command line arguments.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-36771.
