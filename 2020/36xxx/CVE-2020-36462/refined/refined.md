Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `syncpool` crate's `Bucket2` type incorrectly implemented the `Send` trait without a necessary type bound. This allowed instances of `Bucket2` containing non-`Send` types to be moved between threads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unconditional `Send` implementation:** The `Bucket2` struct in affected versions of the `syncpool` crate incorrectly implemented the `Send` trait.
*   **Data Races:**  By allowing non-`Send` types (like `Cell<T>` or `Rc<T>`) to be moved between threads via `Bucket2`, the code introduces the potential for data races.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Data races resulting from the vulnerability can lead to memory corruption, as demonstrated in the proof-of-concept (PoC) from the original report issue.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The CVSS score indicates high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely, as indicated by CVSS Attack Vector of Network (AV:N). However, this is likely more related to the fact that it is a library vulnerability that can be exploited within an application accessed via network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability (PR:N).
*   **No User Interaction:** Exploitation does not require any user interaction (UI:N).
*   **High Attack Complexity:** Exploitation requires a higher degree of complexity (AC:H).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the `syncpool` crate before version `0.1.6`.
*   The fix was implemented by adding a `T: Send` bound to the `Send` implementation of `Bucket2<T>`. This ensures that `Bucket2` can only be `Send` if the type it contains (`T`) is also `Send`.
* The vulnerability is tracked as RUSTSEC-2020-0142, CVE-2020-36462, GHSA-r88h-6987-g79f and GHSA-vp6r-mrq9-8f4h.

In summary, the vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of the `Send` trait in the `syncpool` crate, leading to potential data races and memory corruption.
