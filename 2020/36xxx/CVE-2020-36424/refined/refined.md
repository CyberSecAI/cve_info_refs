Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36424:

**CVE-2020-36424:**

*   **Root Cause:** Side channel vulnerability in RSA private key operations and static (finite-field) Diffie-Hellman.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** An existing counter-measure (base blinding) could be bypassed due to insufficient protection against timing and memory access analysis.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially recover the private keys used in RSA or static (finite-field) Diffie-Hellman operations.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Exploitation requires precise timing and memory access information, typically achievable by an untrusted operating system attacking a secure enclave (e.g., SGX or TrustZone).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs fine-grained timing and memory access information, often in a scenario where an untrusted OS has the ability to attack a secure enclave.

**Summary of relevant information:**

The provided text details a side-channel attack vulnerability related to RSA private key operations and static Diffie-Hellman. The vulnerability exists due to a bypass of an existing counter-measure (base blinding), making it possible for attackers with precise timing and memory access information to recover the private keys. The vulnerability is described as primarily affecting environments where a secure enclave is being attacked by an untrusted OS. Patches were released in Mbed TLS versions 2.24.0, 2.16.8, and 2.7.17 to address this issue.
