Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-36630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the FreePBX CDR module, specifically within the User Control Panel (UCP) application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The code is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- The `Cdr.class.php` file handles user inputs such as 'limit', 'offset', 'order', 'sort', and 'search'. Some of these values, particularly 'search', are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
- The `views/ucp_config.php` file also has an issue. It uses `htmlentities()` on the `$value` but not `$key` in the `<option>` tag, which could lead to issues when the keys contain special characters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary SQL code, leading to potential unauthorized data access, data modification, or even denial of service.
- The SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive data stored within the CDR database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the UCP application, particularly the ajax handler, by manipulating the `$_REQUEST` parameters, especially the 'search' parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the FreePBX UCP application. This likely means they would need some level of access to the UCP portal, which may or may not require authentication depending on the specific setup and vulnerability location.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters in the `Cdr.class.php` file, such as the `search` parameter.
- They would also need knowledge of SQL syntax and how to craft a malicious query.

**Additional Details:**
- The commit log message `FREEI-1763 (ver14)SQL Injection in Cdr Module for the UCP application` clearly identifies the issue as a SQL injection vulnerability.
- The diff in `Cdr.class.php` doesn't show the actual fix for the SQL injection, instead, it is just sanitizing the 'limit' and 'offset' input using `filter_var`.
- The diff in `views/ucp_config.php` shows the addition of `htmlentities()` for the `$value` in the `<option>` tag in the `ucp_config.php`, but no change for the key.

This information is more detailed than a basic CVE description, providing insight into the specific code files and parameters involved in the vulnerability.
