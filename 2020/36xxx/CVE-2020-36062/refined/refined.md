Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36062:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2020-36062. The GitHub issue explicitly mentions "CVE:2020-36062" and describes the vulnerability in the "Dairy Farm Shop Management System" from phpgurukul.com.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the use of hardcoded administrator credentials within the source code of the "Dairy Farm Shop Management System." Specifically, the admin username and password can be found in the SQL file.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** The application stores sensitive credentials directly in the source code, making them easily accessible to anyone with access to the codebase.
*   **Weak Hashing:** Although the password in the SQL file was hashed, it was done using MD5, which is easily cracked using online tools or rainbow tables.
*   **Default Credentials:** The system uses a default username and password, which are also publicly known.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Admin Panel Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the administrator panel by using the discovered hardcoded credentials.
*   **Malicious Activities:** Once inside the admin panel, an attacker can perform various malicious activities, including:
    *   Modifying or deleting data.
    *   Adding malicious code.
    *   Disrupting the system's operations.
    *   Accessing sensitive information.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Code Access:** The attacker needs access to the source code of the application to find the credentials. This could happen through several attack vectors:
    *   Gaining access to the server where the code is deployed.
    *   Downloading the application from the provided link where source code is available.
    *   Compromising a developer's environment or account with access to the source code.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Source Code:** The attacker needs to obtain the source code of the application.
*   **Basic Technical Skills:** The attacker needs basic technical knowledge to extract the credentials from the database file, identify the MD5 hash, and decrypt it.
*   **Network access** The attacker needs to be able to access the application to login using the recovered credentials.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a detailed proof-of-concept (POC) outlining the steps to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The mitigation advice suggests using a stronger hashing algorithm like SHA-256 with SALT and changing default credentials during installation time.

In summary, CVE-2020-36062 describes a vulnerability where hardcoded credentials in the "Dairy Farm Shop Management System" allowed unauthorized access to the admin panel, leading to a range of potential malicious activities. The vulnerability was caused by insecure coding practices, including storing sensitive information directly in source code and using a weak hashing algorithm.
