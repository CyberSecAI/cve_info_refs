Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36470:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `RingBuffer` type in the `disrustor` crate retrieves mutable references from the `DataProvider` in a non-atomic manner. This allows for the potential creation of multiple mutable references to the same data. Additionally, `RingBuffer` incorrectly implements the `Send` and `Sync` traits for all types `T`, without ensuring that `T` itself is `Send` and `Sync`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Data Races:** The non-atomic retrieval of mutable references allows multiple threads to potentially access and modify the same memory location concurrently, resulting in data races.
2.  **Undefined Behavior:** The creation of aliased mutable references violates Rust's memory safety rules, leading to undefined behavior.
3.  **Incorrect `Send` and `Sync` Implementation:** The `RingBuffer` struct incorrectly implements `Send` and `Sync` traits for all types, enabling non-Send types to be unsafely moved between threads, potentially causing issues when the type is dropped or accessed from the wrong thread.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Data races and the creation of multiple mutable references can lead to memory corruption.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** This can manifest in unpredictable ways, potentially leading to crashes, unexpected program behavior, or security vulnerabilities.
*  **Denial of Service:** Specifically, the incorrect `Send`/`Sync` implementations allows for a panic in the `Drop` implementation, which leads to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered when the `RingBuffer` is used in a multithreaded context, where multiple threads attempt to obtain mutable references to the underlying data.
*   The ability to send non-Send types between threads further exacerbates this vulnerability and enables the demonstrated panic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to use the `disrustor` crate in their project.
*   The attacker needs to utilize `RingBuffer` in a multithreaded context, where multiple threads try to concurrently access the `RingBuffer`.
*   No special privileges are required.

**Summary of additional details:**

The provided content gives specific details on how to exploit the issue using a custom `NonSend` struct that panics when dropped from a thread different from the creating thread, demonstrating data races. It also references the commit that fixed the vulnerability. The content provides a more complete view of the vulnerability compared to the standard CVE description.
