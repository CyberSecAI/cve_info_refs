# RingBuffer can create multiple mutable references and cause data races
The `RingBuffer` type retrieves mutable references from the `DataProvider` in a
non-atomic manner, potentially allowing the creation of multiple mutable
references. `RingBuffer` also implements the `Send` and `Sync` traits for all
types `T`.
This allows undefined behavior from the aliased mutable references as well
as data races.

Hello fellow Rustacean,

we (Rust group [@sslab-gatech](https://github.com/sslab-gatech)) are scanning Rust code on crates.io for potential memory safety and soundness bugs and found an issue in this crate which allows safe Rust code to exhibit an undefined behavior.

## Issue Description

[disrustor/src/ringbuffer.rs](https://github.com/sklose/disrustor/blob/966b949dae93d7c56f796d5c5f49be8e5a73a9c6/src/ringbuffer.rs#L48-L49)

Lines 48 to 49
in
[966b949](/sklose/disrustor/commit/966b949dae93d7c56f796d5c5f49be8e5a73a9c6)

|  | unsafe impl<T> Send for RingBuffer<T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<T> Sync for RingBuffer<T> {} |

`RingBuffer` implements Send/Sync regardless of whether the internal type implements Send/Sync. This allows users to send a non-Send type across threads with `RingBuffer`.

`RingBuffer`'s Send/Sync should probably have a trait bound on the internal type `T`, or if `RingBuffer` needs to implement Send/Sync and it is not meant to be created by the end user, `new()` should be hidden with `pub(crate)` or so.

## Reproduction

Below is an example program that sends Non-Send type across threads using safe APIs of `disrustor`.

Show Detail

This example just shows that non-Send type is sent across the thread, but it is possible to demonstrate a data race with a more complicated example.

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

#[macro_use]
extern crate static_assertions;

use disrustor::internal::RingBuffer;

use std::marker::PhantomData;
use std::thread;

struct NonSend {
    created_thread: thread::ThreadId,
    // Mark this struct as `NonSend`
    _marker: PhantomData<*mut ()>,
}

assert_not_impl_all!(NonSend: Send);

impl Default for NonSend {
    fn default() -> Self {
        NonSend {
            created_thread: thread::current().id(),
            _marker: PhantomData,
        }
    }
}

impl Drop for NonSend {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        if thread::current().id() != self.created_thread {
            panic!("NonSend destructor is running on a wrong thread!");
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let buffer = RingBuffer::<NonSend>::new(1);

    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        drop(buffer);
    });

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

Output:

```
thread '<unnamed>' panicked at 'NonSend destructor is running on a wrong thread!', src/main.rs:47:13
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Any', src/main.rs:59:19

Return code 101

```
