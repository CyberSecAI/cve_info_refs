Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `aovec` crate in Rust lacks bounds on its `Send` and `Sync` traits. This means that `aovec::Aovec<T>` implements `Send` and `Sync` for all types `T`, even those that are not thread-safe (non-Send or non-Sync types).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing `Send` and `Sync` trait bounds:** The core issue is the absence of necessary restrictions on the types that can be used with `Aovec`, allowing non-thread-safe types to be used across thread boundaries.
- **Data races and memory corruption:** This flaw can lead to data races and memory corruption because types not designed for concurrent access are being used in a multi-threaded context without proper synchronization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Undefined behavior:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to undefined behavior in the program.
- **Memory corruption:** Memory corruption can occur, which may lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or potential security issues.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The vulnerability can potentially lead to high impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability due to memory corruption and data races.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system where the vulnerable code is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low privileges:** The attacker needs only low privileges on the target system.
- **No user interaction:** The vulnerability doesn't require any user interaction to be exploited.
- **Concurrency:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the use of the vulnerable type in a concurrent context.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered high severity, as it can lead to significant issues like memory corruption.
- The affected versions of the `aovec` crate are `<= 1.1.0`.
- There are no patched versions available at the time of the information.
- The vulnerability is related to concurrency and thread-safety issues.

The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-662 and CWE-787.

The CVSS score is 7.0, with the vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
