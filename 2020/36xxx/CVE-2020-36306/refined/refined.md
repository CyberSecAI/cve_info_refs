Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36306:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing validation of the `back_url` parameter in Redmine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of validation on the `back_url` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the Redmine application. This can result in various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the web page
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing a malicious `back_url` parameter. When a user clicks this link, the injected script is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious URL containing the crafted `back_url` parameter to potential victims. The attacker does not require any prior authentication on the Redmine instance to craft the malicious URL.
