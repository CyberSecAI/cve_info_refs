{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the 'id' parameter in the URL, before using it in an SQL query. This direct inclusion of unsanitized input into the query creates an SQL injection vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
        "Lack of input sanitization",
        "Direct use of unsanitized user input in SQL queries"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of data, and potentially gaining administrative privileges on the database, severely impacting the business.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the `customeredit.php` page.",
        "The attacker must manipulate the 'id' parameter in the URL (e.g., http://localhost/tailor/customeredit.php?id=1) to inject SQL code."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the vulnerable `customeredit.php` page",
      "The attacker needs to have a tool to craft and send malicious requests such as Burp Suite or sqlmap"
    ]
