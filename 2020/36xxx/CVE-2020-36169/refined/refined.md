The provided content is related to CVE-2020-36169.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from NetBackup processes using OpenSSL that attempt to load and execute libraries from paths that do not exist by default on Windows systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled search path: NetBackup processes search for libraries in predictable locations that are not protected by default on Windows, allowing for the injection of malicious libraries.
- Insecure library loading: The software attempts to load libraries from user-writable directories without proper validation or security checks.
- Privilege escalation: By placing a malicious library in a directory NetBackup attempts to load from, a low-privileged user can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM or Administrator privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain administrator-level access on the system. This includes the ability to:
- Access all data.
- Access all installed applications.
- Run arbitrary code.
- Potentially compromise the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attack is performed by a local low-privileged user on the Windows system where NetBackup is installed.
- Directory Creation: The attacker creates a directory with a specific path that NetBackup will attempt to load a library from.
- Malicious Library: The attacker places a malicious library in the created directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have low-privileged user access to the target Windows system.
- The attacker must be able to create directories on the system's drives.
- The attacker needs to create malicious dynamic-link library that will be loaded by vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects NetBackup master servers, media servers, clients, and OpsCenter servers on the Windows platform.
- The system is vulnerable during install/upgrade and post-install during normal NetBackup operations.
- The document also references CVE-2020-36163 which is a similar vulnerability but uses Strawberry Perl instead of OpenSSL.
- Mitigation includes applying hotfixes or using a workaround by securing affected directories.
