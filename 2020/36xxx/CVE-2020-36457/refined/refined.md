Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36457:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `AtomicBox` type in the `lever` crate for Rust. This type incorrectly implements the `Send` and `Sync` traits for *all* types `T`, regardless of whether `T` itself is thread-safe.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Trait Implementation:** `AtomicBox` unconditionally implements `Send` and `Sync` traits, which are meant to signify thread-safe types.
*   **Data Races:**  This incorrect implementation allows non-thread-safe types like `Rc` and `Cell` to be used across thread boundaries. This leads to data races where multiple threads access and modify the same memory location concurrently without proper synchronization, leading to undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Undefined Behavior:** The primary impact is undefined behavior, which means the program can behave unpredictably.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Specifically, the data races can lead to memory corruption, potentially overwriting or corrupting data.
*  **Crash:** The provided example code demonstrates how this leads to a segmentation fault.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Concurrency:** The vulnerability is triggered by using the `AtomicBox` with types that are not thread-safe and passing them between different threads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Modification:** An attacker would need the ability to introduce the vulnerable code pattern of using `AtomicBox` with non-Send/Sync types into a program.
*   **Multithreading:** The attacker would need to be able to execute the vulnerable code in a multithreaded context to trigger the race condition.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the `lever` crate before 0.1.1.
*   The fix involves adding bounds to the `Send` and `Sync` trait implementations, requiring that `T` also implements those traits when `AtomicBox` does.
*   The CVSS score is 8.1 (High), reflecting the severe nature of the vulnerability. The CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`, indicating that the vulnerability is exploitable over a network with high complexity, requires no privilege or user interaction, with no scope change, and results in high impacts to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
* The issue was discovered by the Rust group at SSLab-Gatech.
