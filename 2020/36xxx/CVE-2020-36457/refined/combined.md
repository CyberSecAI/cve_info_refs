## Package

cargo

lever
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.1.1

## Patched versions

0.1.1

## Description

An issue was discovered in the lever crate before 0.1.1 for Rust. AtomicBox implements the Send and Sync traits for all types T. This allows non-Send types such as Rc and non-Sync types such as Cell to be used across thread boundaries which can trigger undefined behavior and memory corruption.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# AtomicBox lacks bound on its Send and Sync traits allowing data races
`AtomicBox` is a `Box` type designed to be used across threads, however, it
implements the `Send` and `Sync` traits for all types `T`.
This allows non-Send types such as `Rc` and non-Sync types such as `Cell` to
be used across thread boundaries which can trigger undefined behavior and
memory corruption.

## Description

![@ammaraskar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?u=2c52b558c4daef8e3a6df73e6e4234d169f462b8&v=4&size=48)[ammaraskar](https://github.com/ammaraskar)opened [on Nov 10, 2020](https://github.com/vertexclique/lever/issues/15#issue-740069651)

Currently `AtomicBox` implements the Sync/Send traits unconditionally:

[lever/src/sync/atomics.rs](https://github.com/vertexclique/lever/blob/15a96c7f99e91f3d50c97ebba1147b3905f9f3dc/src/sync/atomics.rs#L104-L105)

Lines 104 to 105
in
[15a96c7](/vertexclique/lever/commit/15a96c7f99e91f3d50c97ebba1147b3905f9f3dc)

|  | unsafe impl<T: Sized> Sync for AtomicBox<T> {} |
| --- | --- |
|  | unsafe impl<T: Sized> Send for AtomicBox<T> {} |

I think this should only be when `T: Sized + Sync` and `T: Sized + Send` respectively. Otherwise, this makes it possible to send across types that aren't safe to use across threads such as `Cell`s. Here's a demonstration that causes a data-race:

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use lever::sync::atomics::AtomicBox;

use std::cell::Cell;
use crossbeam_utils::thread;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum RefOrInt<'a> {
    Ref(&'a u64),
    Int(u64),
}
static SOME_INT: u64 = 123;

fn main() {
    let cell = Cell::new(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
    let atomic_box = AtomicBox::new(&cell);

    thread::scope(|s| {
        s.spawn(move |_| {
            let smuggled_cell = atomic_box.get();

            loop {
                // Repeatedly write Ref(&addr) and Int(0xdeadbeef) into the cell.
                smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Ref(&SOME_INT));
                smuggled_cell.set(RefOrInt::Int(0xdeadbeef));
            }
        });

        loop {
            if let RefOrInt::Ref(addr) = cell.get() {
                // Hope that between the time we pattern match the object as a
                // `Ref`, it gets written to by the other thread.
                if addr as *const u64 == &SOME_INT as *const u64 {
                    continue;
                }

                // Due to the data race, obtaining Ref(0xdeadbeef) is possible
                println!("Pointer is now: {:p}", addr);
                println!("Dereferencing addr will now segfault: {}", *addr);
            }
        }
    });
}
```

This outputs:

```
Pointer is now: 0xdeadbeef

Return Code: -11 (SIGSEGV)

```

### Description

`AtomicBox<T>` is a `Box` type designed to be used across threads, however, it
implements the `Send` and `Sync` traits for all types `T`.

This allows non-Send types such as `Rc` and non-Sync types such as `Cell` to
be used across thread boundaries which can trigger undefined behavior and
memory corruption.
