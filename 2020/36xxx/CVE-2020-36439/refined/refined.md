Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36439:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `ticketed_lock` crate incorrectly implemented `Send` for `ReadTicket<T>` and `WriteTicket<T>` without requiring `T` to also be `Send`. This allowed users to send types that are not thread-safe (i.e., types that do not implement `Send`) across threads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect `Send` implementation:** The core issue is the unconditional implementation of `Send` for `ReadTicket` and `WriteTicket`, regardless of the type `T`. This violates Rust's safety guarantees related to concurrent programming.
- **Data Races:** Sending a non-`Send` type `T` across threads through `ReadTicket`/`WriteTicket` could lead to data races if the type `T` has internal mutability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** Data races can lead to memory corruption due to unsynchronized access and modification of shared mutable data.
- **Undefined Behavior:** Data races result in undefined behavior, which could include crashes, incorrect computations, and other unpredictable issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is exploited when a user creates a `ReadTicket` or `WriteTicket` with a type `T` that is not `Send` and then sends the ticket to another thread.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to use the `ticketed_lock` crate and create a scenario where a non-`Send` type is used as the type parameter `T` and then send the resulting `ReadTicket<T>`/`WriteTicket<T>` across threads.
- The attacker needs to clone the non-Send types with internal mutability.

**Summary of technical details:**

The `ticketed_lock` crate prior to version 0.3.0 incorrectly implemented `Send` for `ReadTicket<T>` and `WriteTicket<T>`, even when the type `T` was not `Send`. This allows sending non-threadsafe data across threads, which can cause data races, leading to memory corruption and undefined behavior. The fix involves adding `T: Send` bounds to `Send` impls of `ReadTicket`/`WriteTicket`.

This content provides more technical detail than the typical CVE description by detailing how the improper implementation of `Send` allows for data races and memory corruption through sending non-Send data across threads, which also aligns with the provided CVSS vector.
