The provided content describes a vulnerability in the ownCloud Android app, specifically related to bypassing the app lock (pattern/passcode/fingerprint). This aligns with the general vulnerability type described in CVE-2020-36248.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the ownCloud Android app allowed backups of app data via `adb`, which included the app's preferences file. This file contained sensitive information related to the app lock feature, such as the pincode/pattern and whether the lock is active.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext storage of sensitive information (CWE-312): The app stored the lock settings in a preference file without adequate protection.
- Insecure backup mechanism: Allowing app data backups through `adb` exposed sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with physical access to the device could bypass the app lock, gaining unauthorized access to the ownCloud app and its associated data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Physical access to the Android device.
- Utilizing `adb` to create a backup of the ownCloud app.
- Modifying the app preferences file in the backup to disable the lock.
- Restoring the modified backup to the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Physical access to the target Android device.
- Ability to use `adb` to create and restore backups.
- Basic knowledge of Android app preferences files.

**Additional details from the content:**
- This vulnerability was assigned the internal ID `oC-SA-2020-003`.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 3.9, with a vector of AV:P/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
- Affected versions: ownCloud Android App versions < 2.15
- The fix involved disabling app data backup.
