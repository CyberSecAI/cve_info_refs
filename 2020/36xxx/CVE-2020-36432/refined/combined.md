## Package

cargo

alg\_ds
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

<= 0.3.1

## Patched versions

None

## Description

An issue was discovered in the alg\_ds crate through 2020-08-25 for Rust. `Matrix::new()` internally calls `Matrix::fill_with()` which uses `*ptr = value` pattern to initialize the buffer. This pattern assumes that there is an initialized struct at the address and drops it, which results in dropping of uninitialized struct.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Matrix::new() drops uninitialized memory

# Description

`Matrix::new()` internally calls `Matrix::fill_with()` which uses `*ptr = value` pattern to initialize the buffer.
This pattern assumes that there is an initialized struct at the address and drops it, which results in dropping of uninitialized struct.

# Demonstration

* Crate: alg\_ds
* Version: 0.3.1
* OS: Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS
* Rust: rustc 1.45.2 (d3fb005a3 2020-07-31)
* Cargo flags: --release

```
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

use alg_ds::ds::matrix::Matrix;
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};

static creation_cnt: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);
static drop_cnt: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);

#[derive(Clone)]
struct DropDetector(u32);

impl Default for DropDetector {
    fn default() -> Self {
        creation_cnt.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
        DropDetector(12345)
    }
}

impl Drop for DropDetector {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        drop_cnt.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
        println!("Dropping {}", self.0);
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Please check along with the code snippets above.
    {
        // `*ptr = value` acts by dropping existing contents at `ptr`.
        // `Matrix::fill_with()` uses this pattern which result in dropping
        // uninitialized, unallocated struct.
        //
        // Note that the creation of a mutable reference to uninitialized memory
        // region is already UB by itself.
        // `ptr::write` and `MaybeUninit` should be used for the initialization.
        let _ = Matrix::<DropDetector>::new(1, 1);
    }
    {
        // (Bonus) Integer overflow in `layout()` allows to create a huge matrix.
        // Fortunately, every access to the internal buffer are bound-checked,
        // so this doesn't lead to obvious UB by itself.
        let mat = Matrix::<usize>::new(15326306685794188004, 0x123456789);
        println!(
            "rows: {}, cols: {}, number of elements: {}",
            mat.rows(),
            mat.cols(),
            mat.elements_number()

    assert_eq!(
        creation_cnt.load(Ordering::Relaxed),
        drop_cnt.load(Ordering::Relaxed)

}
```

Output:

```
Dropping 0
