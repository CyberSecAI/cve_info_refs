The provided content is related to CVE-2020-36124.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The PAXSTORE ecosystem allows developers to define an XML template for their applications. However, two endpoints in the developer panel are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability in the following endpoints:
  - `POST /p-market-web/v1/developers/apks/{App-ID}/paramTemplateSchema`
  - `POST /p-market-web/v1/developers/{Dev-ID}/app/{App-ID}/paramAnalysis`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows an attacker to manipulate XML data processing.
- Enables listing and reading files from the API server, including sensitive files such as `/path/to/conf/fs.properties` which contains signing keys.
- An attacker could use the compromised keys to manipulate access tokens and gain access to the platform as any desired user (clients and administrators).
- Could lead to remote installation of any application in thousands of payment terminals managed by PAXSTORE.
- Potential for botnet creation, DDoS attacks, theft of financial information, and rendering payment terminals non-operational.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can sign up as a developer in the PAXSTORE marketplace.
- The attacker crafts a malicious XML payload containing an external entity reference that points to a local file on the server.
- The attacker sends this malicious XML payload in a POST request to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a developer account in the PAXSTORE marketplace.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious XML payload and be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable API endpoints.
