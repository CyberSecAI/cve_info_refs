Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `FixedCapacityDequeLike::clone()` function within the `array-tools` crate for Rust.
- The function doesn't properly handle panics that might occur within the user-provided `T::clone()` method.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Panic Handling:** The core weakness is the absence of proper panic handling within the `clone()` function. If a user-provided `T::clone()` panics during the cloning process, the function does not gracefully unwind, leading to a partially initialized buffer being dropped. This is because the code was not designed to correctly clean up partially initialized memory if a panic occurs during the cloning process.
- **Memory Corruption:** The dropping of a partially uninitialized buffer results in memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to memory corruption, which is a critical issue that can have a range of negative consequences.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, memory corruption vulnerabilities can often be leveraged by attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution. This is a major concern given the "Critical" severity rating and the high values for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability in the CVSS score.
- **Data Exposure, Modification, Denial of Service:** Depending on the specifics of the memory corruption, an attacker might be able to achieve confidentiality breaches, integrity violations (data modification) or trigger a denial of service (availability loss).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is classified as "Network", which means the vulnerability can be exploited remotely. This typically means that an attacker could trigger the vulnerable code via an API or other kind of network interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction:** Exploitation does not require any user interaction.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low, indicating that exploitation is relatively easy to achieve.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The network attack vector means that the attacker can be remote to the system/application using the library

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects versions of the `array-tools` crate prior to 0.3.2.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.3.2 and later.
- **CWEs:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-908 (Use of Uninitialized Resource) and CWE-909 (Improperly Signed/Unsigned Comparison).
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 9.8, indicating a "Critical" severity.
