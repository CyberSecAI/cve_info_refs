Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center.
* **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The system allows unauthorized access to board metadata through direct object references. Specifically, it fails to properly check user permissions before disclosing the board's metadata, leading to an IDOR vulnerability.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker can view board metadata of boards they should not have access to, potentially revealing sensitive information about project structure, team organization, and other internal configurations.
* **Attack Vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability. The attack vector involves crafting requests that directly reference the board's object, circumventing proper permission checks.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be remote and does not require specific privileges to exploit this vulnerability. They must, however, be able to interact with the Jira application, likely via HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions prior to 8.5.10 and versions between 8.6.0 and 8.13.2.
*   Fixed versions are 8.5.10, 8.13.2, and 8.14.0.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a low-severity issue with a CVSS score of 3.
