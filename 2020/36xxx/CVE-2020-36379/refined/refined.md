```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to restrict arbitrary commands in user input, leading to command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure command formatting allows execution of arbitrary commands through user-controlled input.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Code Execution (RCE), Information Disclosure, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting malicious commands into the user input, which is then used to build and execute a system command.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input that is used to form the command that is executed by the application."
