{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper nonce verification in the `edit_meta_value()` function within the Custom Field Template plugin. Specifically, the nonce check is only performed if the nonce parameter is set, and is skipped if it is missing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to modify meta field values on a WordPress site if they can trick an administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a malicious link.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves tricking a logged-in administrator to submit a forged request, typically by getting them to click a link or visit a crafted web page.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in administrator to trigger a malicious request. This could be through social engineering, or other methods of tricking a user to click a link"
