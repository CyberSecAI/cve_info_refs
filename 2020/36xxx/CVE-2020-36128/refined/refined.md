The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in PAXSTORE, a marketplace for PAX Technology's payment terminals. One of these vulnerabilities is related to CVE-2020-36128.

**CVE-2020-36128:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to retrieve a terminal's session token (X-Terminal-Token) without requiring any password or security key. This token is used to authenticate the terminal with the marketplace, allowing it to download applications and receive commands.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The lack of proper authentication or authorization when requesting the X-Terminal-Token at the `/p-market-api/v1/terminal/login` endpoint.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can impersonate another terminal by crafting requests to obtain a valid X-Terminal-Token, which allows a malicious terminal to access the marketplace, download restricted applications and receive commands intended for another device, or remove the terminal from the control of the original reseller.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network interception of the request responsible for assigning the X-Terminal-Token to a terminal, and crafting a new request using the intercepted information.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept the network traffic between a payment terminal and the PAXSTORE server to obtain necessary data to craft the malicious request. They also require a payment terminal to impersonate.
