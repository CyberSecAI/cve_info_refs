Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-36430

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of buffer size within the `decode_font` function, specifically in the `decode_chars` function, due to a change to an unsigned integer type. This leads to a one-byte buffer overwrite during font decoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** A one-byte buffer overflow occurs when decoding fonts, due to an incorrect size calculation, leading to a write beyond the allocated memory.
*   **Integer Type Mismatch:** The root cause is using the wrong integer data type for subtraction during size calculations in the `decode_chars` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overwrite triggers an assertion failure, causing the application using libass to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious ASS/SSA Subtitle Files:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious ASS or SSA subtitle file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Control over ASS Track Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted subtitle file to an application that uses the vulnerable libass library. This could be done remotely if the application is processing subtitles from an external source.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `decode_font` and `decode_chars` functions within the libass library.
*   The incorrect buffer size calculation is due to a regression in commit `910211f1c0078e37546f73e95306724358b89be2`.
*   The fix was introduced in commit `017137471d0043e0321e377ed8da48e45a3ec632`.
* The vulnerable code is in `libass/ass.c` file, where a fix was implemented to calculate the buffer size correctly.
* OSS-Fuzz discovered this vulnerability and reported it as issue 26674.
* The vulnerability exists in libass versions prior to 0.15.1.
