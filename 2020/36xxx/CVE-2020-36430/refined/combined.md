## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 35 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [RPM-4.17](/wiki/Changes/RPM-4.17 "Changes/RPM-4.17")
* [IBus 1.5.25](/wiki/Changes/IBus_1.5.25 "Changes/IBus 1.5.25")
* [F35MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F35MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F35MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [golang1.17](/wiki/Changes/golang1.17 "Changes/golang1.17")
* [LLVM-13](/wiki/Changes/LLVM-13 "Changes/LLVM-13")

## Before the rebuild

```
- exclude GHC from the mass rebuild by updating the scripts before run.
- use rpmdevtools 9.5 for rpmautospec support

```

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 21st. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f35
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f35. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f35 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f35
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

| [Description](#c0)  Ian Smith    2002-09-17 09:09:17 UTC  ``` The Gentoo mailx - 8.1.1 - does not utilize the REPLYTO environment variable.  This prevents me from sending external email from the command line as replies need to be sent to a POP server rather than the originating address.  Debian Woody uses 8.1.2, which does respect REPLYTO, along with several extra variables.  TIA. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2002-09-17 13:21:00 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 8042](show_bug.cgi?id=8042 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Request for updated mailx") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-09-18 16:42:31 UTC  ``` We'll update it after the freeze, but until then have you considered "nail"?  It's usually better maintained, and it does let you set reply-to. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Ian Smith    2002-09-19 05:07:29 UTC  ``` Hadn't heard of it, but will try - thanks. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Nick Hadaway    2002-11-04 12:22:00 UTC  ``` I will be getting this into portage within the next couple of days.  I have been trying to find a maintained mailx source.  Debian claims to have a  cvs version of 8.1.2... but I don't know where the mailx cvs repository is. Any ideas? ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Ian Smith    2002-11-05 05:19:46 UTC  ``` I couldn't find it either, I guess the Debian maintainers should be able to help - are you going to ask them or shall I? ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Martin Holzer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-11-05 06:31:56 UTC  ``` <http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/mailx/mailx_8.1.2>- 0.20020411cvs.orig.tar.gz <http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/mailx/mailx_8.1.2-0.20020411cvs>- 1.diff.gz  here's the source :) ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Martin Holzer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-11-05 06:38:13 UTC  ``` latest unstable: <http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/mailx/mailx_8.1.2>- 0.20020411cvs-4.diff.gz  maintainer: robert@debian.org ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Martin Holzer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-11-05 06:51:34 UTC  ``` the download location for all files:  <http://http.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/mailx/> ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Ian Smith    2002-11-05 12:33:05 UTC  ``` Looks promising!

As I hear more I will post  on this bug. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Nick Hadaway    2002-11-13 01:15:43 UTC  ``` I got a response :)  <snip> Yes, I'm taking it from the OpenBSD cvs repository (<http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/mail/>). </snip>  I will check out the latest source and have an ebuild up soon. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Ian Smith    2002-11-13 03:19:30 UTC  ``` <burns> excellent! </burns> ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Nick Hadaway    2002-12-01 16:34:57 UTC  ``` I have ported mailx-8.1.2 from the openbsd cvs repository.

### Description
