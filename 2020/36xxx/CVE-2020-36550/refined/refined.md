Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-36550:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Table Name" field when adding a table within the Multi Restaurant Table Reservation System.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application doesn't sanitize user-supplied input when adding a new table. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Table Name" field, which will then be stored in the database and executed when the table list is viewed by other users or administrators in `/dashboard/table-list.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Sensitive Information Theft:** This can be used to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data.
- **Account Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially hijack user accounts if they can steal their session tokens.
- **Malware Distribution:** Malicious scripts can be used to redirect users to malicious websites, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Defacement:** The attacker can alter the visual appearance of the web page, potentially causing reputational damage.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is via HTTP POST requests to `/TableReservation/dashboard/manage-insert.php`.
- The attacker needs to submit a malicious payload in the "tablename" parameter when adding a table through `/dashboard/table-add.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a restaurant administrator or a user with the permission to add tables to the system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application.
- **Understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft and send HTTP POST requests.
