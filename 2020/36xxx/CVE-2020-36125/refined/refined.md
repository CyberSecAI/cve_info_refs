Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-36125:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The PAXSTORE marketplace requires password revalidation for sensitive operations, such as uploading a new certificate signature for Android applications. However, this password validation can be bypassed by directly accessing the relevant API endpoints, even if the user is already authenticated. This circumvents the intended security mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypass of Password Revalidation:** The vulnerability lies in the ability to bypass the password revalidation mechanism intended for sensitive operations by directly accessing the backend API endpoints.
*   **Lack of Proper Authorization Checks:** The system fails to properly enforce the password revalidation requirement at the API level, allowing direct access without the additional authentication step.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Operations:** An attacker who has access to a user's session can perform sensitive operations without the user's explicit consent or knowledge, because of the bypassed password revalidation mechanism.
*   **Compromise of Platform Security:** Attackers can upload new certificate signatures for Android applications and access secrets of credentials for integrations with external systems.
*   **Lateral Movement**: Access to external system credentials allows attackers to potentially pivot to other parts of the infrastructure.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Access to credential secrets for external systems, as well as the certificate and its password, allows attackers to extract sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct API Requests:** The attack vector is through direct requests to the vulnerable API endpoints, bypassing the intended web application flow.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker needs to have access to an already authenticated userâ€™s session in order to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to a User Session:** The attacker needs to have compromised a legitimate user session, implying that they might have already bypassed the initial login/authentication mechanism.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoints:** The attacker must be aware of the specific API endpoints that are vulnerable to this bypass.
*   **Ability to Craft API Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to directly interact with the backend APIs.
