Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token in the `wp-pro-quiz` plugin's quiz deletion functionality. The plugin directly uses the `$_GET['id']` parameter in the `deleteAction()` function, which then deletes the quiz, without any CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into executing actions they did not intend, specifically deleting quizzes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Quiz Deletion:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete any quiz on the vulnerable WordPress website. This can lead to data loss and disruption of the website's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link:** The attacker crafts a malicious link containing the deletion request, embedding the target quiz ID in the `id` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking the malicious link (e.g., through email, chat, or other means).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need to have any valid account on the targeted WordPress site.
- **Social Engineering Skill:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in administrator to click the crafted link to trigger the deletion request.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable plugin (wp-pro-quiz) and the vulnerable URL.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is located in the file `wp-pro-quiz/lib/controller/WpProQuiz_Controller_Quiz.php`. The `deleteAction()` function directly uses the `$_GET['id']` parameter without any CSRF token validation, leading to the deletion of the quiz with specified ID.

**Affected Versions:**
The vulnerability affects `wp-pro-quiz` plugin versions up to and including version 0.37.

**Additional Information:**
The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 2020-06-22, and no known fix was available at the time of the provided content.
