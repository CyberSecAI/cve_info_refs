Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-36127:

**CVE-2020-36127:**

*   **Root Cause:** The PAXSTORE marketplace allows users with administrator privileges to control the public certificate key used for signing Android applications on payment terminals. While the admin panel doesn't display the current certificate and password, an API endpoint exists that exposes the p12 certificate in base64 format along with its password. This endpoint is accessible even by users with reseller privileges, bypassing the intended security controls.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure API Endpoint:** The API endpoint `GET /p-market-web/v1/admin/signature/signaturePuk` provides unauthorized access to sensitive certificate and password information.
    *   **Insufficient Access Control:** Reseller-level users are able to access the sensitive certificate data, which is intended to be restricted to administrators.
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The certificate and password are directly exposed through the API response.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Compromised Application Signing:** An attacker with access to the certificate and password can sign malicious applications with the platform's trusted signature, allowing them to bypass security controls and potentially install malicious software on payment terminals.
    *   **Malware Distribution:**  This could lead to widespread malware distribution across the payment terminals managed by the PAXSTORE.
    *   **Financial Fraud:** The malicious applications could be designed to intercept payment information, conduct fraudulent transactions, or manipulate other aspects of the payment process.
    *   **Complete platform compromise:** The attacker can impersonate any user and install malware on any terminal.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the API endpoint.
    *   **Reseller or Higher Privilege Account:** The attacker needs a compromised or legitimate user account with at least reseller privileges on the PAXSTORE platform.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   A user account with reseller or higher privileges.
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable API endpoint.
    *   Knowledge of the API endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by PRIDE Security during a security assessment.
*   PAX Technology was informed and has released a fix in version 8.0 of PAXSTORE.
*   The report notes that PRIDE Security did not retest the fixes to confirm their effectiveness.
