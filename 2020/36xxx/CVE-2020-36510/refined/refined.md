- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The 15Zine theme does not sanitize and escape the `cbi` parameter before outputting it in the response via the `cb_s_a` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions performed in the context of the victim's session.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `cbi` parameter and tricking a user into visiting the link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create malicious URLs and trick victims into accessing these URLs. No authentication or privileged access is needed.
