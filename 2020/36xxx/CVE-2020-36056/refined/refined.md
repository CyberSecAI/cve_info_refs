Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-36056:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Host Name" field of the Ping Diagnostic functionality within the Beetel 777VR1 modem's web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the web application fails to sanitize or encode user input submitted in the "Host Name" field during a ping diagnostic operation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability can have several impacts:
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will execute in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page. This could lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to gain unauthorized access to the router's management interface.
    *   **Phishing Attacks:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance or content of the router's web interface.
    *   **Malware Delivery:** Injecting scripts that attempt to download malware onto the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface of the Beetel 777VR1 modem. Specifically, the attacker needs to:
1.  Access the modem's web interface (likely on the local network).
2.  Navigate to the Ping Diagnostic page.
3.  Insert the malicious JavaScript payload within the "Host Name" input field.
4.  Submit the form, triggering the execution of the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable modem or have access to it remotely.
*   The attacker needs to have credentials to log into the modem's web interface or exploit a vulnerability that enables such access without credentials.
*   The attacker needs to be able to navigate the web interface and find the "Ping Diagnostic" page.
*   The attacker requires basic knowledge of HTML and Javascript to craft a suitable malicious payload.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability is present in firmware version V01.00.09\_55 of the Beetel 777VR1 modem.
* The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Vivek Panday.
* The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.4, with a moderate severity.
* The attack complexity is low, and user interaction is required.
