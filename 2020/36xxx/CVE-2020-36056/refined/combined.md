# Exploit Title: beetel Moderm 777vr1 — Cross Site Scripting on the beetel 777vr1 via the Ping Diagnostic

# Date: 2020–12–25

# Exploit Author: VIVEK PANDAY

# Version: Firmware Version V01.00.09\_55 777VR1

# Tested on Windows10

# Linkedln Contact: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-panday-796768149/>

# [CVE-2020-36056](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m2mv-ff48-hjqh "CVE-2020-36056")

[Cross-site scripting] (XSS)

Cross site scripting (XSS) is a common attack vector that injects malicious code into a vulnerable web application. XSS differs from other web attack vectors (e.g., SQL injections), in that it does not directly target the application itself. Instead, the users of the web application are the ones at risk.

[Step To Reproduce]

1. Login to your router
2. After signing
3. Select for Maintance Mode
4. Go to Ping Diagnostic option
5. In the host Name field, enter any of these payloads:
   <script> alert ("Hacked") </script>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
