Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2020-36552:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization when handling user-provided data in the "Made by" field within the menu-add.php page of the "Multi Restaurant Table Reservation System." This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS flaw. This means that the injected malicious script is stored within the application's database and is executed each time the affected page is loaded, potentially impacting other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code to steal session cookies or other sensitive data from administrators or users who access the vulnerable page (menu-list.php).
*   **Account Hijacking:** Stolen session cookies could be used to impersonate legitimate users and potentially take over their accounts.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites, execute arbitrary code within their browsers, or perform other actions that could compromise the application or its users.
*   **Website Defacement:** Injected scripts could modify the page content and deface the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited via the web interface of the "Multi Restaurant Table Reservation System."
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `manage-insert.php` endpoint, using the `menu-add.php` form.
*   **Malicious Payload in "Made by" Field:** The attack vector involves inserting a malicious JavaScript payload into the "madeby" parameter of the POST request when adding or modifying a menu item.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
*   **Authentication (potentially):** To exploit this specific vulnerability, the attacker needs to be authenticated as a user with the permission to add or modify menu items. This is typically a restaurant administrator or staff account.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided content demonstrates how an attacker can inject a `<svg onload=alert("XSS2")>` payload within the `madeby` field of the menu form.
*   The payload is then stored in the database and rendered when the `menu-list.php` page is accessed, triggering the XSS vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability lies within the `dashboard/menu-list.php` page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The identified vulnerable software is "Multi Restaurant Table Reservation System" version 1.0.
*   The provided content includes proof-of-concept (PoC) HTTP requests demonstrating how to trigger this vulnerability.
*   This is a persistent XSS vulnerability, as the injected payload is stored in the database.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-36552 describes a persistent XSS vulnerability in the "Multi Restaurant Table Reservation System" which allows an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript within the application by injecting a payload into the "Made by" field of the menu form. This can lead to account hijacking, information disclosure, and other malicious actions.
