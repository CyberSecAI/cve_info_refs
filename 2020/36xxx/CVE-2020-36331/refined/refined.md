Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-36331:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `ChunkAssignData()` function within `mux/muxinternal.c` of the libwebp library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read.
- Heap-based buffer overflow (as mentioned in the Red Hat bugzilla description, though the primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read.)

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Disclosure of sensitive information.
-  Denial of Service (DoS).
-  Potentially arbitrary code execution, if the out-of-bounds read leads to memory corruption. (this is inferred from the impact of similar vulnerabilities in libwebp listed in the Debian advisory)
- Data confidentiality and to the service availability are at highest threat

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a maliciously crafted WebP image.
- A remote attacker may be able to cause arbitrary code execution (based on the libxml2 CVE-2021-3518 impact description), this is related to libwebp processing, although this is less clear in terms of attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted WebP image to a vulnerable application or system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in libwebp version 1.0.1.
- The issue is also present in multiple NetApp products, specifically "ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility", and fixed in version 9.13.1.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of libwebp prior to 1.0.1
- Multiple other CVEs related to libwebp were patched at the same time as this one.

The provided information generally aligns with the description in the CVE, but the additional context from the various sources provides a more detailed understanding of the vulnerability, its impact, and affected products.
