                 CVE-2020-36331 CVE-2020-36332

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libwebp, the implementation
of the WebP image format, which could result in denial of service, memory
disclosure or potentially the execution of arbitrary code if malformed
images are processed.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.1-2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libwebp packages.
