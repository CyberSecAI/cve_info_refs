- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The APTARE application loads OpenSSL, which attempts to load a configuration file from a predictable location that a low-privileged user can create.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insecure file loading and arbitrary code execution. The application tries to load an OpenSSL configuration file from a location where a low-privileged user can create directories, allowing them to inject a malicious OpenSSL engine. Additionally, the OpenSSL executable distributed with APTARE for Linux is also vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM, leading to complete system compromise, including access to all data and installed applications. The attacker gains administrator privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access. A low-privileged user on the Windows system can create the necessary directory structure to place the malicious OpenSSL engine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low-privileged user account on the target Windows system is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability.
