- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `RuleID` field of the "Define Entitlement Rules" section when creating a new entitlement policy, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The injected payload is stored in the system and executed when a user accesses the affected page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browser of any user who views the page containing the injected payload. This can lead to redirection to malicious sites, UI manipulation, information theft, and other malicious activities. Although the session cookies are protected with `httpOnly`, limiting session hijacking, other malicious activities are possible.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker needs access to the WSO2 Identity Server's admin interface to create or modify entitlement policies.
    - The attacker injects the XSS payload into the `RuleID` field when defining entitlement rules.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the WSO2 Identity Server with sufficient permissions to create or modify entitlement policies (likely administrator privileges).
