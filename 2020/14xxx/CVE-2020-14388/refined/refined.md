Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14388:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in the Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform where member permissions for an API's admin portal were not properly enforced.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper enforcement of member permissions within the 3scale API management platform. This allows authenticated users to bypass intended access controls.
- **Permissions Bypass:** The vulnerability specifically involves bypassing the normal account restrictions related to API services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An authenticated user could gain access to API services for which they do not have the necessary permissions.
- **Potential Data Exposure/Manipulation:** Depending on the specifics of the API service, unauthorized access could lead to exposure of sensitive data or the ability to manipulate data without proper authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the 3scale API Management Platform itself.
- It requires an attacker to have a valid, though limited, authenticated user account on the platform.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user of the 3scale API Management Platform. They do not need elevated privileges, only the ability to log in.
- They do not need physical access to any system, making it remotely exploitable.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-14388 describes a vulnerability in Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform that allows authenticated users to bypass normal permission restrictions and access API services they are not authorized to access. This is due to insufficient access controls and enforcement of member permissions. An attacker only needs a valid user account to potentially exploit this vulnerability.
