Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-14338:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in how Wildfly's implementation of the Xerces XML parser, specifically the `XMLSchemaValidator` class within the JAXP component, enforces the "use-grammar-pool-only" feature. This incomplete enforcement allows for manipulation of the XML validation process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incomplete enforcement of `use-grammar-pool-only`:** The core issue is that the "use-grammar-pool-only" feature, which should restrict the XML validator to a pre-defined grammar pool, is not properly enforced, allowing external schema to be loaded.
- **XML validation manipulation:** Due to the incomplete enforcement, a specially crafted XML file can influence the validation process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The vulnerability allows a specially crafted XML file to manipulate the validation process in certain cases. The specific impact from the manipulation isn't detailed in the provided text, but this could potentially lead to denial of service or other vulnerabilities dependent on the nature of validation process.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through a specially crafted XML file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted XML file to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The bug report explicitly states that this is the same flaw as CVE-2020-14621, which affected OpenJDK.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Red Hat products, including various versions of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, Red Hat Single Sign-On, Red Hat Openshift Application Runtimes, RHPAM, RHDM, and Red Hat Fuse.
-  The bug was fixed in `xerces jboss-2.12.0.SP3`
