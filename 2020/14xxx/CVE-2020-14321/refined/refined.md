{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper access control in course enrolment allowed teachers to assign themselves the manager role within a course.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Privilege escalation due to flawed course enrolment process.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A teacher could grant themselves manager privileges within a course, potentially leading to unauthorized access, control, and modification of course materials and user data. This could also allow them to perform actions they are not normally permitted to perform.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through the course enrolment functionality.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have a teacher role within the course to perform the privilege escalation."
