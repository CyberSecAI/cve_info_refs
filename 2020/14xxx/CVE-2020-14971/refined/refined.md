  "CVE-2020-14971": {
    "description": "Pi-hole through 5.0 allows code injection in piholedhcp (the Static DHCP Leases section) by modifying Teleporter backup files and then restoring them. This occurs in settings.php. To exploit this, an attacker would request a backup of limited files via teleporter.php. These are placed into a .tar.gz archive. The attacker then modifies the host parameter in dnsmasq.d files, and then compresses and uploads these files again.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when restoring backups, specifically the `host` parameter within `dnsmasq.d` configuration files and the `adlist.json` file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Code Injection",
      "Improper Input Validation",
       "Insufficient Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution within the context of the Pi-hole web interface, leading to a complete compromise of the system.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker leverages the teleporter functionality to back up a limited set of configuration files, modifies the `host` parameter in a dnsmasq.d configuration file or the adlists.json file with malicious code, recompresses the files into a `.tar.gz` archive, and then restores the modified backup.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires the ability to interact with the Pi-hole web interface and have sufficient permissions to perform backup and restore operations. They also need the ability to modify files and compress them into a `.tar.gz` archive."
