  "CVE-2020-14350": {
    "description": "It was found that some PostgreSQL extensions did not use search_path safely in their installation script. An attacker with sufficient privileges could use this flaw to trick an administrator into executing a specially crafted script, during the installation or update of such extension. This affects PostgreSQL versions before 12.4, before 11.9, before 10.14, before 9.6.19, and before 9.5.23.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because the search_path was not properly sanitized during CREATE EXTENSION, allowing execution of arbitrary SQL functions with elevated privileges.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper handling of `search_path` during extension installation",
          "Lack of proper authorization checks during extension creation"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker, with the ability to create objects in the target or prerequisite extension's schema, can potentially execute arbitrary SQL code with the privileges of the user performing the installation, which is typically a superuser. This can lead to privilege escalation and potentially compromise the database server.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Local access required, exploiting a `CREATE EXTENSION` operation performed by a superuser."
        ],
          "required_capabilities": [
          "Ability to create objects in extension schema or prerequisite schema.",
		  "Ability to convince a superuser to install or upgrade a vulnerable extension."
