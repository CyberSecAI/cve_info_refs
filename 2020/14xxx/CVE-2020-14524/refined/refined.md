Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-14524:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Heap-based buffer overflow

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-122:** Heap-based Buffer Overflow: The software does not properly control the size of a memory allocation on the heap, which can lead to a buffer overflow when writing data to that allocation.
*   The advisory also mentions **CWE-400** (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) related to CVE-2020-14522, but this is separate from CVE-2020-14524.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   The advisory notes that a successful exploitation of the **CWE-400** vulnerability may cause a denial-of-service condition (related to CVE-2020-14522, not CVE-2020-14524).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote exploitation via network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the affected OPC server over the network.
*   Low skill level required to exploit.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Product:** Softing Industrial Automation OPC (all versions prior to the latest build of Version 4.47.0).
*   **CVSS Score:** The heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2020-14524) has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).
*   **Mitigation:**  Update to the latest version of the Softing OPC software (Version 4.47.0 or later). Other mitigations include minimizing network exposure, isolating control system networks behind firewalls, and using secure VPNs for remote access.
