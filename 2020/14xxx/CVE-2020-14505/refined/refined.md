- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the `restoreDatabase` method of the `NetworkServlet` class.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection. Lack of proper input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based, unauthenticated access to the vulnerable `restoreDatabase` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker with network access to the affected iView installation. No authentication is required.
