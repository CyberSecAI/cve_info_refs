Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-14374:

**CVE-2020-14374**

*   **Root Cause:** A flawed bounds check in the `copy_data` function within the DPDK vhost_crypto library. Specifically, the `dlen` variable, which is used to determine the number of bytes to copy, is taken directly from the `desc->len` field, which is controlled by the attacker. This attacker-controlled length is used in a `memcpy` operation without any check against the destination buffer size (`data`).
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow. The code copies data from a guest-controlled memory region into a host-side buffer without validating that the source size (`dlen`) is within the bounds of the target buffer (`data`).
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper bounds checking on the input data. The code assumes that the attacker will provide valid length data, which is not a safe practice.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A malicious guest VM can exploit the buffer overflow to write arbitrary data to arbitrary addresses within the host's memory space. This can lead to arbitrary code execution within the vhost_crypto process.
    *   **VM Escape:** Successful exploitation enables a complete compromise of the virtual machine's host-guest isolation. This is a complete VM escape, allowing the attacker control of the host.
    *   **Data Confidentiality and Integrity Loss:**  The ability to write arbitrary data to arbitrary memory locations allows an attacker to compromise sensitive data and potentially alter the expected operation of the host system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Guest VM:** The attack vector involves a malicious actor controlling a guest VM.
    *   **Virtio Ring:** The attacker manipulates the virtio ring descriptors to control the `desc->len` and `desc->addr` values, which govern the source and size of the copy operation.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have the ability to execute code within a guest VM.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the virtio ring descriptors.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `vhost_crypto.c` file within the DPDK library.
*   The vulnerable code copies data from a guest-host shared memory region into the host-side buffer using `rte_memcpy`. The source data and size of the copy are derived from a virtio descriptor which is controlled by the attacker.
*   The `data` buffer on the host side is only 2KB, while the length of data to copy (`dlen`) can be up to 4GB which leads to buffer overflow.
