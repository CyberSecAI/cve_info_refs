Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-14302:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Keycloak's implementation of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) Service Provider part for identity brokerage. The `redirect_uri` endpoint for each configured OIDC IdP does not invalidate "state" parameters after they've been used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Replay Attack:** The core weakness is the reusability of the "state" parameter at the `redirect_uri` endpoint. This allows an attacker to reuse a valid "state" parameter multiple times.
- **Lack of State Parameter Validation:** The system fails to invalidate or properly validate the "state" parameter upon its initial use, allowing subsequent requests with the same parameter to be processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform replay attacks by sending multiple requests to the `redirect_uri` endpoint using the same valid "state" parameter.
- This could lead to Keycloak initiating multiple requests to the IdP's Token Endpoint, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or information disclosure depending on the specifics of the IdP's token endpoint behavior and how the tokens are used in the overall system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the `redirect_uri` endpoint of Keycloak.
- An attacker can intercept a valid "state" parameter from an initial legitimate authentication flow and then replay this parameter in subsequent crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept or obtain a valid "state" parameter associated with a successful authentication with an external identity provider through Keycloak.
- They also need the ability to send crafted requests to the vulnerable `redirect_uri` endpoint using the same "state" parameter.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects Red Hat Single Sign-On (RHSSO) 7.4, and has been addressed in RHSA-2021:0967, RHSA-2021:0968, RHSA-2021:0969 and RHSA-2021:0974
- The fix was included in Keycloak version 13.0.0.
