RELATED:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization of untrusted data in the jackson-databind library, specifically concerning the handling of serialization gadgets and typing, which allows for the potential remote execution of commands or scripts.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The weakness lies in the improper handling of serialization gadgets with polymorphic type handling. Specifically, it is caused due to the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing in FasterXML jackson-databind, which can be exploited when the software accepts untrusted JSON content, has vulnerable classes in the classpath, and enables polymorphic type handling without proper validation. This also includes vulnerable classes from the 'org.apache.drill.exec:drill-jdbc-all' library.
  - Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can result in remote execution of commands or scripts, leading to a compromise of the affected system, including potential unauthorized data access, modification or denial of service.
  - Attack vectors: The attack vector involves sending malicious JSON content to a server running the vulnerable jackson-databind library. The attacker crafts JSON that contains a reference to a gadget class, which, during deserialization, executes malicious code. This is done by using type identifiers that indicate that an object with a specific class needs to be created. 
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs the ability to send malicious JSON to the service running the vulnerable application. They must know a suitable gadget class available in the server application's classpath, and the application must be using insecure polymorphic deserialization to interpret the JSON.

Additional Details:
- This issue was addressed in FasterXML/jackson-databind version 2.9.10.5.
- The vulnerability is related to the  'org.apache.drill.exec:drill-jdbc-all' library, specifically the class `org.apache.xalan.lib.sql.JNDIConnectionPool`
- Oracle products such as Oracle WebLogic Server, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle E-Business Suite, and various other Oracle products have been identified as being affected by this vulnerability as well through the inclusion of the vulnerable library, jackson-databind.
