Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-14156:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure default file permissions assigned to the `/etc/ipmi_pass` file in OpenBMC's `phosphor-host-ipmid` component. This file stores obfuscated IPMI passwords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The `/etc/ipmi_pass` file was initially created with world-readable permissions (likely 644 or similar). This allows any user with access to the BMC (via SSH or SCP) to read the file.
- **Password Exposure:** Although the passwords in `/etc/ipmi_pass` are obfuscated, they are not encrypted and can be decoded, leading to potential exposure of IPMI credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who can read the `/etc/ipmi_pass` file can decode the obfuscated IPMI passwords.
- **Complete System Control:** Armed with IPMI user credentials, an attacker can gain full control of the baseboard management controller (BMC) through IPMI, potentially leading to complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the BMC, typically via SSH or SCP, to access and read the `/etc/ipmi_pass` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Access to BMC:** The attacker must have a valid user account with SSH or SCP access to the BMC.
- **File System Access:**  Ability to read the `/etc/ipmi_pass` file.
- **Knowledge/Tools:** Capability to decode the obfuscated password stored in `/etc/ipmi_pass` file.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Component:** `user_channel/passwd_mgr.cpp` in `OpenBMC phosphor-host-ipmid` before commit `b265455a2518ece7c004b43c144199ec980fc620`.
- **Mitigation:** A manual mitigation is to change the `/etc/ipmi_pass` file permissions to 600 (read/write only by the owner) using the command `chmod 600 /etc/ipmi_pass`.
- **Fix:** The fix involves setting the file permissions to 600 when creating/updating the `/etc/ipmi_pass` file in commit `b265455a2518ece7c004b43c144199ec980fc620`.
