This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Use more restrictive permissions on /etc/ipmi-pass

[Browse files](/openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid/tree/b265455a2518ece7c004b43c144199ec980fc620)

```
This forces the permissions on /etc/ipmi-pass to be 0600 or RW only by
owner. This is to prevent non-owners from reading the file, even though
it is obfuscated to make it harder for ipmi passwords to leak.

Tested: change ipmi passwords and see that the /etc/ipmi-pass file has
        0600 permissions.

OpenBMC Security Advisory

Title: [CVE-2020-14156](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q8hw-xhc2-q397 "CVE-2020-14156"). Network IPMI before 2020-04-03 does not ensure the `/etc/ipmi_pass` file has strong file permissions.

The `/etc/ipmi_pass` file was created with world-readable permission. Any user with SSH or SCP access to the BMC can read and decode the credentials and escalate to any IPMI user.

A mitigation is to log into the BMC as the root user and change the file permission to 600 (read write only by the owner): `chmod 600 /etc/ipmi_pass`.

The fix is in openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid commit b265455a2518ece7c004b43c144199ec980fc620, here: [openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid@b265455](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid/commit/b265455a2518ece7c004b43c144199ec980fc620)

OpenBMC Security Advisory

Title: [CVE-2020-14156](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q8hw-xhc2-q397 "CVE-2020-14156"). Network IPMI before 2020-04-03 does not ensure the `/etc/ipmi_pass` file has strong file permissions.

The `/etc/ipmi_pass` file was created with world-readable permission. Any user with SSH or SCP access to the BMC can read and decode the credentials and escalate to any IPMI user.

A mitigation is to log into the BMC as the root user and change the file permission to 600 (read write only by the owner): `chmod 600 /etc/ipmi_pass`.

The fix is in openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid commit b265455a2518ece7c004b43c144199ec980fc620, here: [openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid@b265455](https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-host-ipmid/commit/b265455a2518ece7c004b43c144199ec980fc620)
