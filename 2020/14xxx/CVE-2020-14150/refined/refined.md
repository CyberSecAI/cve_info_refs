Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-14150:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is described as "several unlikely crashes found by fuzzing have been fixed." This indicates that the vulnerabilities were likely due to unexpected input or state conditions that caused the Bison parser generator, or the parsers it produces, to crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Crashes due to unexpected input:** The primary weakness is the presence of code paths that could lead to a crash when subjected to specific, likely uncommon, inputs. This suggests potential issues with input validation or state handling within the Bison-generated parsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is denial of service. An attacker could potentially craft specific input that would cause a Bison-generated parser to crash, thus disrupting the application or service using the parser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious input:** An attacker would need to provide specifically crafted input to the parser, or to a service or application using a vulnerable parser, which could trigger the crash. The specifics of this malicious input are not described in this material, but are indicated to be "unlikely", meaning it is likely not an obvious input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable parser. This could be via any route that the vulnerable parser might receive input, including directly through user interaction, by injecting malicious data into a data stream, or by manipulating files used by the parser.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report mentions that the crashes were found by fuzzing, which implies that these issues were not easily discoverable through normal testing.
* The fix appears to have been released in version 3.5.4, with a newer version 3.7.1 also resolving the issue.

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description. It clarifies the nature of the vulnerability as a crash caused by specific inputs and highlights that it was discovered through fuzzing.
