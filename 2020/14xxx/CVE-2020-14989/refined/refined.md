Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14989:

**CVE-2020-14989:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses the POST method for form submissions and checks the origin header, but it fails to prevent form submissions via the GET method. When using the GET method, form parameters are included in the URL, bypassing the origin header check.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **CSRF vulnerability:** The application does not properly validate the source of the requests, allowing an attacker to trick a user into performing unintended actions.
    *   **Bypassed origin check:** The check is not effective against GET requests.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the web application by visiting a malicious page with crafted GET requests. This could include:
        *   Creating new accounts
        *   Changing passwords
        *   Executing administrative functions (when combined with RCE vulnerability).
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The attack involves crafting a malicious HTML page containing image tags with URLs that trigger GET requests to vulnerable endpoints.
    *   The victim must be logged into the application and visit the attacker's malicious page.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create a web page and lure a logged-in user into visiting it.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE description):**

*   The provided content describes the CSRF vulnerability in detail, explaining how the application assumes form submissions are done using POST requests and how this assumption is not true. It explicitly states how GET requests bypass the origin header check, allowing the attack.
*   It also provides a specific example of a malicious HTML page with image tags that exploit the CSRF vulnerability.
*   The content also describes how the CSRF vulnerability can be combined with an RCE vulnerability (CVE-2020-14987), leading to remote code execution when an administrator visits a malicious page.
