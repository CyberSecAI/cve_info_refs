Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-14329:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the `/api/v2/labels/` endpoint of Ansible Tower. This endpoint was accessible to all logged-in users, regardless of their organization affiliation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
