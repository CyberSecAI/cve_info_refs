Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-14507:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied paths before using them in file operations. This lack of validation allows for directory traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path Traversal (CWE-22): The application fails to restrict pathnames to a specific directory, allowing attackers to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** In some instances, exploitation of this path traversal can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to read sensitive files from the system.
- **System Availability:** Attackers can create or download arbitrary files, and potentially limit system availability.
- **Crash the application**: Successful exploitation could lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible remotely, and does not require authentication to exploit.
- Attackers can send HTTP requests with manipulated path parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need network access to the vulnerable service.
- No prior authentication is required.
- Low skill level is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Specific vulnerable areas:**
- `exportLinks` method of the `LinksTable` class
- `importZtpConfiguration` method of the `ZTPConfig` class
- `MenuServlet` servlet.
- `NetworkServlet` servlet

**Additional Notes:**
- Multiple instances of this path traversal vulnerability were discovered within the Advantech iView software, all sharing the same root cause.
- The vulnerability can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities (such as command injection and SQL injection) to gain full control of the affected systems.
- A patch (version 5.7 of iView) has been released by Advantech to address these issues.
