Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14334:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure file permissions on the `/run/foreman` directory in Red Hat Satellite 6 installations. This directory contained cached files with sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The `/run/foreman` directory had permissions that allowed local users to read its contents.
- **Exposure of Cached Credentials:** The cached files within the directory contained credentials providing full access to the Satellite instance via the API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers could access sensitive information, including cached credentials.
- **Integrity Compromise:**  Attackers could potentially modify or alter the Satellite instance using the compromised credentials.
- **System Availability Impact:** Full control of the Satellite instance could lead to disruption of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** A local user on the Foreman server was able to read the cache files.
- **API Access:** The exposed credentials could be used to gain control via the API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local user account** on the Foreman/Satellite server.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was mitigated by changing the directory permissions of `/run/foreman` to 0750, removing read permissions for others.
- Patches were released via RHSA-2020:4127 for Red Hat Satellite 6.7 on RHEL 7 and RHSA-2020:4366 for Red Hat Satellite 6.7 on RHEL 8.
- The vulnerability allows for complete access to the Satellite instance.
