WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Monitor and restrict access to port 5900/tcp to trusted IP addresses only

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC ITC Industrial Thin Clients represent powerful control terminals with high-resolution wide-screen
touch displays in 12, 15, 19 and 22 inch formats.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2017-18922

websockets.c in LibVNCServer prior to 0.9.12 did not properly decode certain WebSocket frames.
A malicious attacker could exploit this by sending specially crafted WebSocket frames to a server,
causing a heap-based buffer overﬂow.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-15681

LibVNC commit before d01e1bb4246323ba6fcee3b82ef1faa9b1dac82a contains a memory leak
(CWE-655) in VNC server code, which allow an attacker to read stack memory and can be abused
for information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it can be used to leak stack memory
and bypass ASLR. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity. These vulnerabilities
have been ﬁxed in commit d01e1bb4246323ba6fcee3b82ef1faa9b1dac82a.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-15690

A ﬂaw was found in libvncserver. An integer overﬂow within the HandleCursorShape() function can be
exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overﬂow by tricking a user or application using libvncserver
to connect to an unstrusted server and subsequently send cursor shapes with specially crafted
dimensions. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data conﬁdentiality and integrity as well as
system availability.

## Details

Ramin Farajpour Cami discovered that LibVNCServer incorrectly handled

certain malformed unix socket names. A remote attacker could exploit this

with a crafted socket name, leading to a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-20839](/security/CVE-2019-20839))

It was discovered that LibVNCServer did not properly access byte-aligned

data. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

LibVNCServer to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2019-20840](/security/CVE-2019-20840))

Christian Beier discovered that LibVNCServer incorrectly handled anonymous

TLS connections. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

LibVNCServer to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. ([CVE-2020-14396](/security/CVE-2020-14396))

It was discovered that LibVNCServer incorrectly handled region clipping. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause LibVNCServer to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2020-14397](/security/CVE-2020-14397))

It was discovered that LibVNCServer did not properly reset incorrectly

terminated TCP connections. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to cause an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2020-14398](/security/CVE-2020-14398))

It was discovered that LibVNCServer did not properly access byte-aligned

data. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

LibVNCServer to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2020-14399](/security/CVE-2020-14399),

[CVE-2020-14400](/security/CVE-2020-14400))

It was discovered that LibVNCServer incorrectly handled screen scaling on

the server side. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

LibVNCServer to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-14401](/security/CVE-2020-14401))

It was discovered that LibVNCServer incorrectly handled encodings. A

remote attacker could use this issue to cause LibVNCServer to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2020-14402](/security/CVE-2020-14402), [CVE-2020-14403](/security/CVE-2020-14403), [CVE-2020-14404](/security/CVE-2020-14404))

It was discovered that LibVNCServer incorrectly handled TextChat messages.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause LibVNCServer to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2020-14405](/security/CVE-2020-14405))
