Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when creating or modifying alerts within the Solarwinds Orion web console. Specifically, the "name of alert definition" and "Responsible Team" fields are vulnerable to injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is Stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code is injected into the database through the vulnerable fields and later executed when other users view the affected pages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they visit the "Alerts" page or view alert details. This can lead to:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
    - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive data that users have access to through the web application.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance or content of the web pages.
    - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - **Privilege escalation:** Potentially leveraging the vulnerability to escalate privileges if an administrator visits the injected content.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting malicious payloads within the "name of alert definition" and "Responsible Team" fields when creating or modifying an alert.
    -  Payload examples: `<svg/onload=alert('name') />` and `<svg/onload=alert('XSS') />`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Privileged access to create alerts:** The attacker needs to have the privileges to create and/or modify alerts within the Solarwinds Orion web console.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable fields:** The attacker must be aware of the specific fields vulnerable to XSS injection ("name of alert definition" and "Responsible Team").
