Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-14979

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the insecure implementation of the `WinRing0x64.sys` driver, a third-party component used by EVGA's Precision X1 software. Specifically, the driver creates a device object with a NULL DACL, meaning no access control list is applied, allowing any user on the system to interact with it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Insecure Driver Implementation:** The `WinRing0x64.sys` driver, included in the application, did not implement proper access control on its device object.
-   **NULL DACL:** The driver utilizes a NULL DACL, which grants all users access to the device object.
-   **Direct Access to Hardware:** The driver provides access to sensitive functionalities like:
    -   Reading and writing to arbitrary physical memory.
    -   Reading and modifying Model Specific Registers (MSRs).
    -   Reading/writing to I/O ports.
-   **Lack of Privilege Checks:** The driver does not enforce privilege checks before allowing access to these sensitive operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE):** A low-privileged user can exploit this vulnerability to gain `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges.
-   **Arbitrary Memory Access:** An attacker can use the driver to read and write to any memory location. This can be leveraged to inject code or modify system parameters.
-   **System Instability:** Abusing direct access to hardware could lead to system crashes or other forms of instability.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Direct Interaction with Driver:** Any user on the system can directly interact with the vulnerable driver due to the lack of access controls.
-   **IOCTL abuse:** By sending crafted Input/Output Control codes (IOCTLs) to the driver, a user can gain read/write access to arbitrary memory locations and perform other privileged operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a standard user account on the target system where the vulnerable EVGA Precision X1 software is installed, which includes the vulnerable driver.
-   **Ability to Interact with the Device Object:** The attacker needs the ability to send IOCTLs to the vulnerable driver's device object, which is made possible by the NULL DACL.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in EVGA Precision X1 versions prior to 1.0.7.
- The driver `WinRing0x64.sys` is a component of the OpenHardwareMonitor library.
- A similar vulnerability using the same driver has been previously reported in HP software (CVE-2019-6333).
- The vulnerability is also categorized as a "wormhole driver" by Eclypsium in their "Screwed Drivers" project.
- The fix implemented by EVGA in version 1.0.7 is to replace the vulnerable WinRing0 driver with their own custom driver that implements proper access control via security descriptors.
- The recommended remediation approach was to replace the `IoCreateDevice()` call with `IoCreateDeviceSecure()` and restrict access using a proper Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) string.
