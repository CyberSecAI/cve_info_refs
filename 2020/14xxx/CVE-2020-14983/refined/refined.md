- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The server-side `NET_ReadSettings` function does not properly validate the `num_players` value received from the client. It uses this value to iterate and write to the `player_classes` array, which is of fixed size (8 elements). An attacker can send a crafted packet with a `num_players` value greater than 8 to trigger a buffer overflow on the server's stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack-based buffer overflow.
    - Lack of input validation on the `num_players` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Server crash (denial of service)
    - Potential arbitrary code execution (if stack protection is disabled, although not explicitly proven)
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network: Malicious client sending a specially crafted packet to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be a client connected to the vulnerable server
    - The attacker needs to be able to modify the network packets being sent to the server.
