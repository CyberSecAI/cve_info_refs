Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14005:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied input within the `ExecuteExternalProgram` and `ExecuteVBScript` methods in SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor. Specifically, the system allows users to define VB scripts to run on network events, and fails to sanitize this user-provided VB script before executing it as a system call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core issue is that the application executes user-controlled input as part of a system command without proper sanitization. This allows the injection of arbitrary commands.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system fails to validate or sanitize the user-provided VBScript before executing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The code is executed with SYSTEM privileges, leading to a full compromise of the system.
*   **System Takeover:** By executing a reverse shell, attackers can gain remote access to the host with full control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the SolarWinds web interface.
*   **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to have an authenticated account on the SolarWinds web interface with the permissions to define the VB script to be executed on a specific event.
*   **Malicious VBScript:** The attacker provides a malicious VBScript that is executed upon a defined event, leading to code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials for the SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor web interface.
*   **Privilege:** The attacker must have the permission to create and define VB scripts that are to be executed on events.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `ExecuteExternalProgram` and `ExecuteVBScript` methods.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Orion Platform 2020.2.1 Hot Fix 2
*   The advisory from ZDI mentions Piotr Bazydlo (@chudypb) as the discoverer.
