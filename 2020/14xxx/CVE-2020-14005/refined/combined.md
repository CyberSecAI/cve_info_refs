## Product

Solarwinds Orion - Web Console WPM: 2019.4.1 Orion Platform HF4, NPM HF2: 2019.4

## Author

Amin Rawah

## CVE ID

<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-14005>

## Description

A user can define an VB script on network event occurs to perform a specific action (more info <https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/orionplatform/Content/Core-Executing-a-Visual-Basic-Script-sw1055.htm>). Since there is no restriction on running VB, a malicious user with privilege to run VB on **defined event** can gain access to OS by executing a reverse shell. The following script was tested to run on specific event and the attacker gains access to OS as result <https://github.com/bitsadmin/revbshell> with admin privilege

Sorry, something went wrong.

To clarify, an authenticated user with access to some SolarWinds web interface can get VB to run, this VB could be a reverse shell that gives OS access? And with SYSTEM privileges? It may be obvious I'm not a SolarWinds user.

Sorry, something went wrong.
