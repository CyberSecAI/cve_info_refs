## Details

Ramin Farajpour Cami discovered that LibVNCServer incorrectly handled

certain malformed unix socket names. A remote attacker could exploit this

with a crafted socket name, leading to a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-20839](/security/CVE-2019-20839))

It was discovered that LibVNCServer did not properly access byte-aligned

data. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

LibVNCServer to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2019-20840](/security/CVE-2019-20840))

Christian Beier discovered that LibVNCServer incorrectly handled anonymous

TLS connections. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

LibVNCServer to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. ([CVE-2020-14396](/security/CVE-2020-14396))

It was discovered that LibVNCServer incorrectly handled region clipping. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause LibVNCServer to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2020-14397](/security/CVE-2020-14397))

It was discovered that LibVNCServer did not properly reset incorrectly

terminated TCP connections. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to cause an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2020-14398](/security/CVE-2020-14398))

It was discovered that LibVNCServer did not properly access byte-aligned

data. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

[CVE-2020-14400](/security/CVE-2020-14400))

It was discovered that LibVNCServer incorrectly handled screen scaling on

the server side. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

LibVNCServer to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-14401](/security/CVE-2020-14401))

It was discovered that LibVNCServer incorrectly handled encodings. A

remote attacker could use this issue to cause LibVNCServer to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2020-14402](/security/CVE-2020-14402), [CVE-2020-14403](/security/CVE-2020-14403), [CVE-2020-14404](/security/CVE-2020-14404))

It was discovered that LibVNCServer incorrectly handled TextChat messages.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause LibVNCServer to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2020-14405](/security/CVE-2020-14405))

                 CVE-2020-14405

Several minor vulnerabilities have been discovered in libvncserver, a
server and client implementation of the VNC protocol.

CVE-2019-20839

    libvncclient/sockets.c in LibVNCServer had a buffer overflow via a
    long socket filename.

CVE-2020-14397

    libvncserver/rfbregion.c has a NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2020-14399

    Byte-aligned data was accessed through uint32_t pointers in
    libvncclient/rfbproto.c.

    NOTE: This issue has been disputed by third parties; there is
    reportedly "no trust boundary crossed".

CVE-2020-14400

    Byte-aligned data was accessed through uint16_t pointers in
    libvncserver/translate.c.

    NOTE: This issue has been disputed by third parties. There is no
    known path of exploitation or cross of a trust boundary.

CVE-2020-14401

    libvncserver/scale.c had a pixel_value integer overflow.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1860354#c0)  Marian Rehak    2020-07-24 11:21:47 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in LibVNCServer before 0.9.13. Byte-aligned data is accessed through uint32_t pointers in libvncclient/rfbproto.c.  Upstream commit:  <https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/commit/23e5cbe6b090d7f22982aee909a6a618174d3c2d>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1860354#c1)  Marian Rehak    2020-07-24 11:22:20 UTC  ``` Created libvncserver tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1860355](show_bug.cgi?id=1860355 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-14399 libvncserver: byte-aligned data is accessed through uint32_t pointers in libvncclient/rfbproto.c [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1860356](show_bug.cgi?id=1860356 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2020-14399 libvncserver: byte-aligned data is accessed through uint32_t pointers in libvncclient/rfbproto.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1860354#c3)  Todd Cullum    2020-07-28 00:56:53 UTC  ``` This bug seems to be much more a reliability issue than a security one.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1860354#c4)  Todd Cullum    2020-07-29 19:11:51 UTC  ``` After speaking with upstream, I'm going to set this as not a security issue because there is no known path of exploitation or trust boundary crossing.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1860354#c5)  Todd Cullum    2020-07-29 19:11:55 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw does not affect versions of vino shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, or 8 because vino does not ship the libvncclient. Additionally, Red Hat Product Security does not consider this to be a security vulnerability because no trust boundary is crossed and there is no known path of exploitation. This is a standard software reliability bug.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1860354#c6)  Todd Cullum    2020-07-29 19:32:05 UTC  ``` Filed: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1861883](show_bug.cgi?id=1861883 "CLOSED WONTFIX - pointer aliasing/alignment issue can cause performance issues or crashes") - RHEL8 [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1861879](show_bug.cgi?id=1861879 "CLOSED WONTFIX - pointer aliasing/alignment issue can cause performance issues or crashes") - RHEL7   ``` |  |

Accessing byte-aligned data through uint32_t pointers can cause crashes
on some platforms or reduce the performance. Therefore ensure a proper
stack alignment.

                 CVE-2020-14405
Debian Bug     :

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in libVNC (libvncserver Debian package), an
implemenantation of the VNC server and client protocol.

CVE-2019-20839

    libvncclient/sockets.c in LibVNCServer had a buffer overflow via a
    long socket filename.

CVE-2020-14397

    libvncserver/rfbregion.c had a NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2020-14399

    Byte-aligned data was accessed through uint32_t pointers in
    libvncclient/rfbproto.c.

CVE-2020-14400

    Byte-aligned data was accessed through uint16_t pointers in
    libvncserver/translate.c.

CVE-2020-14401

    libvncserver/scale.c had a pixel_value integer overflow.

CVE-2020-14402

    libvncserver/corre.c allowed out-of-bounds access via encodings.

CVE-2020-14403

    libvncserver/hextile.c allowed out-of-bounds access via encodings.

CVE-2020-14404

    libvncserver/rre.c allowed out-of-bounds access via encodings.

CVE-2020-14405

    libvncclient/rfbproto.c does not limit TextChat size.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
0.9.9+dfsg2-6.1+deb8u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your libvncserver packages.
