# Advisory Details

December 9th, 2020
## X.Org Server XkbSetNames Out-Of-Bounds Access Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-20-1416ZDI-CAN-11428

| CVE ID | [CVE-2020-14345](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-14345) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [X.Org](https://www.x.org/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Server |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of X.Org Server. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of XkbSetNames requests. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of root. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | X.Org has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2020-07-24 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2020-12-09 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

the corresponding update and also the update from USN-4490-1 for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled the

input extension protocol. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

escalate privileges. ([CVE-2020-14346](/security/CVE-2020-14346))

Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly initialized

memory. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-14347](/security/CVE-2020-14347))

Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled the

XkbSelectEvents function. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

escalate privileges. ([CVE-2020-14361](/security/CVE-2020-14361))

Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled the

XRecordRegisterClients function. A local attacker could possibly use this

issue to escalate privileges. ([CVE-2020-14362](/security/CVE-2020-14362))

Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled the

XkbSetNames function. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

escalate privileges. ([CVE-2020-14345](/security/CVE-2020-14345))
