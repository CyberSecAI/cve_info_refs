- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient sanitization of the `to` parameter in the `/auth/login` route.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the webpage content, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing user cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a specially crafted `to` parameter that includes JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver or trick the user into accessing the malicious URL.
