The provided content relates to CVE-2020-14172.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the way Velocity templates were used in Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center. Specifically, the insecure use of velocity templates allowed for remote code execution via insecure deserialization if a server-side template injection vulnerability could be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Server-Side Template Injection: The core weakness is the presence of a template injection vulnerability.
- Insecure Deserialization: Exploitation of the template injection vulnerability could lead to insecure deserialization, which would further enable remote code execution.
- Use of vulnerable versions of Velocity libraries: The use of older vulnerable versions of Velocity libraries contribute to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit the server side template injection vulnerability
- Exploitation can occur if an attacker can control or influence template input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to exploit a server-side template injection vulnerability.
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Jira instance.
