  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `Client_Search` function was called with a NULL `Nick` pointer, leading to a crash due to a dereference of the NULL pointer in `strlcpy` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of NULL pointers",
      "Out-of-bounds access"

    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to application crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted `SERVER` command without a prefix in the server-to-server protocol"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a server connected to the vulnerable ngIRCd instance.",
     "details": "The vulnerability was discovered using American Fuzzy Lop (AFL). The crash occurs when `Client_Search` is called with `Nick == NULL`. The crash happens within the `strlcpy` function, which is trying to copy from the NULL pointer. The call stack shows that `Client_Search` is called from `IRC_SERVER`, which handles server-to-server commands, and is reached when processing the `SERVER` command. The fix for this vulnerability was to check for a prefix in the server command, and disconnect the peer if a prefix is missing, preventing a call to the vulnerable `Client_Search` function. A separate issue was discovered and fixed related to `IRC_KillClient` and `Client_ID`. This function was crashing when `Client` was NULL. This was fixed by addressing the root issue of how `IRC_KillClient()` was being called. It does not fix the underlying network state issue that causes this function to be called with Client == NULL. Additionally, there was a reported out-of-bounds access error in the `Conn_Write` function when called with `Idx=-1`, caused by crafted server-to-server input, which also resulted in a crash."
