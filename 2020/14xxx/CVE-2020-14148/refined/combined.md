### **[alexbarton](/alexbarton)** commented [May 22, 2020](#issuecomment-632784641)

| I think we shouldn’t change the calling convention of `Client_Search()` here (it doesn’t accept `Nick=NULL` which perfectly makes sense, I guess), but we should fix the caller not to call `Client_Server` when there is no „nick“:  Caller is `IRC_SERVER()`, see [irc-server.c, line 189](https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd/blob/master/src/ngircd/irc-server.c#L189): we have to make sure that the request has a prefix.  I have a patch almost ready for this, will do some more tests … |

The SERVER command is only valid with a prefix when received from other
servers, so make sure that there is one and disconnect the peer if not
(instead of crashing ...).

This obsoletes PR #275.

I think my fix in commit [02cf31c](https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd/commit/02cf31c0e267a4c9a7656d43ad3ad4eeb37fc9c5) is „more correct“ as it detects and handles the root cause: no prefix sent by the remote server.  Again, thanks a lot! |

## Description

![@hillu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173211?u=6975dbbee2a0eff68fc0a1485afea85a1a72172d&v=4&size=48)[hillu](https://github.com/hillu)opened [on May 10, 2020](https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd/issues/274#issue-615429224)

I have been fuzzing ngircd using AFL a bit, based on inputs that are used in the testsuite. AFL has found input that can be used to crash a server that has been built with `--with-iconv`. My current hypothesis is that the crash happens because the `iconv_t` context that is passed into `iconv` is invalid (i.e. has not been been initialized at all using `iconv_open`).

Build flags:

```
./configure --without-syslog --with-iconv CC=afl-clang

```

Run mode:

```
ngircd -n -f src/testsuite/ngircd-test1.conf

```

Input ([id:000039,sig:11,src:002604,time:492868267,op:havoc,rep:8-min.txt](https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd/files/4606120/id.000039.sig.11.src.002604.time.492868267.op.havoc.rep.8-min.txt)):

The [ChangeLog](https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd/blob/rel-26-rc2/ChangeLog) lists the following changes since [ngIRCd 26~rc1](https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd/releases/tag/rel-26-rc1):

* Add AppStream metadata file (`contrib/de.barton.ngircd.metainfo.xml`).
* Don't send invalid `CHANINFO` commands when a channel has mode +k set but no key is known to the server. This can happen with a misconfigured predefined channel, for example, and looked like this:

  ```
  CHANINFO #test +Pk  0 :

  ```

  Note the unset key represented by the two spaces. Fix this by sending a `*` in this case and update the CHANINFO documentation, too.
* `ngircd.spec`: Fix names of `README.md` and `INSTALL.md`, add `.md` extension.
* Update description texts in the `README.md` file, the RPM and Debian package files and the manual page: bring them in line with the updated homepage.
* Server-Server protocol: Fix use-after-free when unregistering a directly connected server sending a `SQUIT` for itself.
* Server-Server protocol: Detect bogus `SERVER` commands lacking a prefix. Thanks Hilko Bengen (hillu) for finding & reporting this as well for the patch & pull request (even if fixed differently).

  Closes [#275](https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd/pull/275).
* Fix the `PING`-`PONG` logic: In ngIRCd 26~rc1 this was completely broken (while trying to fix timeouts during server handshakes in bigger networks): the daemon never disconnected any stale peers but kept sending out PINGs over and over again ...
* Test suite: Add missing files needed to test SSL support to `EXTRA_DIST`, so that they are included in distribution archives: in rc1, "make check" fails when using sources from an archive and enabling SSL support. Thanks to Hilko Bengen bengen@hilluzination.de for the patch!

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 32 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC231](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC231 "Changes/GLIBC231")
* [BINUTILS233](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS233 "Changes/BINUTILS233")
* [FontLangProvidesToLangpacks](/wiki/Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks "Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks")
* [golang1.14](/wiki/Changes/golang1.14 "Changes/golang1.14")
* [GCC10](/wiki/Changes/GCC10 "Changes/GCC10")
* [Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0](/wiki/Changes/Free_Pascal_Compiler_3.2.0 "Changes/Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Monday, January 27th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f32
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f32. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f32 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f32
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f32-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f32 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1848415#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2020-06-18 10:47:23 UTC  ```  This is an automatically created tracking bug!  It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1848415#c1)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2020-06-18 10:47:26 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.

### @hillu **[hillu](/hillu)** commented [May 10, 2020](#issue-615438747)

I'm not familiar enough with the ngircd codebase, so I am not entirely

sure if `Client` is the right variable to pass to `KillClient` or if

it should be `c` instead.

### **[alexbarton](/alexbarton)** commented [May 22, 2020](#issuecomment-632773029)

| I think this fix is wrong – as probably is the whole logic here …  Calling `IRC_KillClient()` with `Client=NULL` is perfectly fine and makes sense in `IRC_NJOIN()`, I think: when we kill the strange client, the server introducing it (=which is sending the NJOIN to us) must be informed about this as well (which `Client=NULL` basically means: don’t skip anyone).  So the bug is `IRC_KillClient()` calling `Client_ID()` with `Client=NULL` … and the only `Client_ID()` in `IRC_KillClient()` is in [src/ngircd/irc.c, line 379](https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd/blob/master/src/ngircd/irc.c#L379):  ``` return IRC_WriteErrClient(Client, msg, Client_ID(Client));  ```  And here `Client` is `NULL` – because we pass `Client=NULL` to `IRC_KillClient()` … but the logic is totally bogus, as `IRC_WriteErrClient()` would be called with `Client=NULL`, too, which makes no sense at all!  I'll have to look into that, but I think the bug is in `IRC_KillClient()` – and looking at that function, I guess most(!) of the callers confuse the signature of this function (which is … „not ideal“ to begin with): they pass `Client=Client From=NULL` – but `Client` is completely ignored when `From==NULL` …  So probably I’ll try to change the whole `IRC_KillClient` function to a more obvious signature? And update all callers? Hm … |

### **[alexbarton](/alexbarton)** commented [May 31, 2020](#issuecomment-636494495)

| To be honest, this is a big mess …  `IRC_NJOIN()` isn’t designed to properly handle invalid input (so you can try to join servers to channels, like in your example above) and `IRC_KillClient()` is broken, too, as it doesn’t handle all possible cases.  So what needs to be done?   1. **For ngIRCd 26 … nothing**, I guess: as this seems to only affect the server-server protocol (which is „trusted by design“, we don’t have to handle invalid input here, this is bad practice, but as already pointed out, „by design“ – so removing this bug from the milestone). 2. `IRC_KillClient()` can’t handle the `Client==NULL` case when the `Nick` is something else than a more or less regular client (`CLIENT_USER`, `CLIENT_GOTNICK` or `CLIENT_SERVICE`). It will crash. 3. `ÌRC_KillClient()` has a very confusing syntax, it should be rewritten, and all callers validated & fixed – probably even split into multiple functions handling different cases? 4. And probably `IRC_NJOIN()` should/could do some more input validation, even being server-server links only. But then this would make sense in lots and lots of other places, too … |

Hm, this doesn’t fix this bug properly: Most probably it will prevent the crash by sending a bogus `ERR_CANTKILLSERVER_MSG` (see `IRC_KillClient()` ) to the peer, but the IRC network still get’s out of sync …

| BTW: even the „*client not found, let’s just skip it*“ logic is bogus: if we do this, the global IRC network state is out of sync, as this client is joined to that channel on some servers, but not on all!  The only possible „solution“ is to enforce a net split, that is, disconnect the server from which we got commands that we weren’t able to handle … |

| Will this be fixed anytime soon? I'm kind of worried about using ngIRCd when there's a known security bug in it. |

| Hi [@DerDakon](https://github.com/DerDakon)!  As far as I know no one is working on this, at least I’m not.  And I don’t see this as a *security bug* that much, as it only affects authenticated server-server connections: when you have a malicious but authenticated server in your network, all is lost anyway … the IRC server-server protocol is *trusted by design*, and this is especially true for ngIRCd.  Regards Alex |

| Closing this pull request as **"won't fix":** this patch doesn't fix the issue, and the issue only affects the server-server protocol and can't happen during normal operation (without "faking" a buggy server). And the server-server protocol is "secure by definition". |

## Description

![@hillu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173211?u=6975dbbee2a0eff68fc0a1485afea85a1a72172d&v=4&size=48)[hillu](https://github.com/hillu)opened [on May 12, 2020](https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd/issues/277#issue-616871665)

I have found an out-of-bounds error by fuzzing ngircd using AFL and libdislocate (a custom memory allocator). `Conn_Write` is called with `Idx=-1` which leads to a crash when accessing `My_Connections[Idx].sock`.

The binary is built from `rel-26-rc1` with patches to fix [#275](https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd/pull/275) and [#276](https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd/pull/276) and `__AFL_INIT()` patched into `Conn_InitListeners` in order to support `afl-clang-fast`.

Build flags:

```
./configure --without-syslog CC=afl-clang-fast

```

Run mode:

```
ngircd -n -f src/testsuite/ngircd-test1.conf

```
