Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2020-14179
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the `/secure/QueryComponent!Default.jspa` endpoint.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to access and view custom field names and custom SLA names. This is due to insufficient access controls on the specified endpoint.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Exposure of custom field names and custom SLA names. This information could be used to understand the structure and potentially sensitive areas of a Jira instance.
    *  While not direct data leakage of issue information, it leaks potentially sensitive details about the instance's configuration
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated attackers can send a request to the `/secure/QueryComponent!Default.jspa` endpoint to obtain the information.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the Jira instance.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   Versions prior to 8.5.8
    *   Versions between 8.6.0 and 8.11.0 (inclusive)
*   **Fixed Versions:**
    *   8.5.8
    *   8.11.1 and later (including 8.13.x)
*   **Workarounds:**
    *   Add the dark feature "**public.access.disabled**" to block access to the Jira issue navigator for unauthenticated users. This is the preferred solution for the "fixed" versions.
    *   Add the dark feature "**com.atlassian.jira.plugin.issuenavigator.anonymousPreventCfData.enabled**" which will filter out custom fields for non-authenticated users.
    *   For versions below the fixed versions, block the `/QueryComponent!.*\.jspa` endpoint using a URL rewrite rule in `JIRA_INSTALL/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/urlrewrite.xml`, which will return a 403 error for unauthenticated requests.
