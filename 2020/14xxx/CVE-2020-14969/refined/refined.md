Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing Access Control List (ACL) check in the `getRelatedAttributes` function within the `Attribute.php` model of the MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform). Specifically, when querying the attribute restsearch API, the ACL checks are skipped for attribute correlations. This allows an attacker to potentially access metadata about correlated attributes even if they lack the necessary permissions to access those attributes directly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of ACL enforcement during the `getRelatedAttributes` function when called via the REST API.
- **Information Exposure:** This bypass allows an unauthorized user to gain visibility into potentially sensitive metadata related to correlated attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain metadata about attributes that they should not have access to, potentially revealing sensitive information about security events, threat actors, or other relevant information.
- **Bypass of Security Controls:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the intended access control mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **REST API:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered when the `getRelatedAttributes` function is called through the attribute restsearch API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the MISP REST API:** An attacker needs to have some form of access to the MISP REST API.
- **Knowledge of Attribute IDs:** They would need to know or guess valid attribute IDs to query related attributes.
- **Lack of Permissions:** The attacker must be unauthorized to view the related attributes directly in order to exploit the weakness.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided commit fixes the vulnerability by introducing the user object to the `getRelatedAttributes` function call in `fetchAttributes` and updating the conditions by adding the user to the `buildConditions` function.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Jakub Onderka.
