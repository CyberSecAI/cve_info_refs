Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-14993 (mentioned in conjunction with CVE-2020-14473)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `mainfunction.cgi` file, specifically within the `authusersms` action.
- The vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input from the `formuserphonenumber` parameter is copied into a static buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- Lack of input validation and boundary checks when copying user-provided data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution. An attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, allowing for arbitrary code execution on the device with the privileges of the web server process.
- Full control of the device is possible after exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface, specifically via HTTP POST requests to `/cgi-bin/mainfunciton.cgi`
- Attackers can inject malicious code by crafting a specially designed HTTP POST request with a long `formuserphonenumber` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface. This may require network access to the device's management interface.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable function is triggered by the `authusersms` action within `mainfunction.cgi`.
- The `formuserphonenumber` parameter is used to overflow the static buffer, overwriting the stack.

**Additional Details from Github Repository:**
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability using a `curl` command with an overly long `formuserphonenumber` value. This command includes injected shell code (`ls;echo 'pwn it';`) to demonstrate arbitrary command execution.
- The github repo provides timeline details for reporting the vulnerability and the subsequent fix by DrayTek.

**Affected Products:**
- DrayTek Vigor3900
- DrayTek Vigor2960
- DrayTek Vigor300B

**Resolution:**
- Upgrade firmware to version 1.5.1.1 or later.
