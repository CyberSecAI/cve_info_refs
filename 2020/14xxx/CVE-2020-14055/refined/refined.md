Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-14055

**Vulnerable Product:** Monsta FTP

**Affected Versions:** <= 2.10.1

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient output encoding in the language setting of Monsta FTP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): An attacker can inject and store malicious JavaScript code within the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The stored JavaScript code is delivered to every user of the Monsta FTP instance.
- The JavaScript code executes within the user's browser in the context of the Monsta FTP origin.
- This can lead to:
    - Information leakage, such as theft of FTP credentials.
    - Compromise of other applications running within the same origin.
    - Other malicious actions within the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can store malicious JavaScript through the vulnerable language setting.
- This requires a user to interact with the malicious payload, triggering the stored XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the language setting within the Monsta FTP application. This is possible without authentication.
- The attacker does not need to be logged in.
