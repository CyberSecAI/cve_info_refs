# Monsta FTP Stored Cross-Site Scripting

## Vulnerability Overview

Monsta FTP 2.10.1 or below is prone to a stored cross-site scripting
vulnerability in the language setting due to insufficient output encoding.

* **Identifier** : SBA-ADV-20191211-01
* **Type of Vulnerability** : Cross Site Scripting
* **Software/Product Name** : [Monsta FTP](https://www.monstaftp.com/)
* **Vendor** : Monsta Limited
* **Affected Versions** : <= 2.10.1
* **Fixed in Version** : Not yet
* **CVE ID** : CVE-2020-14055
* **CVSS Vector** : CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N
* **CVSS Base Score** : 8.2 (High)

## Vendor Description

> Monsta FTP is a web-based FTP client, developed in PHP & AJAX, you can
> use to manage your website through your browser, edit code, upload and
> download files, copy/move/delete files and folders - all without
> installing any desktop software.

Source: <https://www.monstaftp.com/>

## Impact

By exploiting the documented vulnerabilities, an unauthenticated attacker
can store JavaScript code on the server. The Monsta FTP instance
delivers the JavaScript code to each user, which is then executed in the
user's browser within the origin of the Monsta FTP instance.
This might lead to information leakage like FTP credentials and can also
affect other applications running within the same origin.

#### What is Monsta FTP?

Monsta FTP is a web-based FTP client, developed in PHP & AJAX, you can use to manage your website through your browser, edit code, upload and download files, copy/move/delete files and folders - all without installing any desktop software.

#### Why is it better than desktop FTP software?

Monsta FTP is your file manager in the cloud. Traditionally, FTP software is downloaded and/or purchased and installed on the user's desktop. Every time a user upgrades their desktop this process needs to be repeated. In situations where you're using a third-party desktop, such as at an Internet cafe, you may not be able to install your own software. With Monsta FTP you can access your install from any device, anywhere.

#### Is it secure?

We recommend using your Monsta FTP install over SSL to protect your data while transiting your network, however FTP itself is not secure, so we always recommend using Monsta FTP's SFTP/SCP (secure FTP) connection option, where possible.

#### Is it customizable?

With the [Business Edition](/upgrade) you can completely customize the user interface, including: fixing your host address/es; disabling any login form, toolbar, and menu options; restricting access to specific IP addresses; and more. In the [Host Edition](/upgrade) you can also add your own logo and color scheme, and enable logging in directly from your own customer panel.

#### Is it free to use?

Our [Lite Edition](/download) includes basic FTP functionality, like file and folder uploading/downloading, and is free to use, always. If you're looking for more functionality, like on-screen file editing, customizable interface, and rebranding, we have paid [upgrade options](/upgrade) available.
