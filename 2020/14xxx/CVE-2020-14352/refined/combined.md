| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1860408#c0)  Miro Hrončok    2020-07-24 13:29:02 UTC  ``` Hello, please see [https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/6RO5HL5GTPALQO4XB746OSTZYG334DAN/](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel%40lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/6RO5HL5GTPALQO4XB746OSTZYG334DAN/) for context and discussion.  tl;dr:  1. fedora-repos-modular are installed when upgraded to Fedora 33 2. `dnf autoremove` removes the package because it is only installed as a dependency (via obsoletes) and no other package requires it 3. the intention is to keep the package unless the user explicitly removes it   I'd like to ask if dnf system-upgrade could do:      if fedora-repos-modular is installed:         dnf mark install fedora-repos-modular     else:         do nothing  I am assuming it is not possible to do this from a scriptlet, but do correct me if that is possible.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1860408#c1)  Daniel Mach    2020-07-27 11:36:41 UTC  ``` We'll look into reinstalling installed comps groups. That would install and mark the package with the "group" reason.  Would that work for you?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1860408#c2)  Miro Hrončok    2020-07-27 13:28:28 UTC  ``` It would, but won't there be undesired side effects? Like re-installing intentionally removed packages?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1860408#c3)  Daniel Mach    2020-07-27 14:22:15 UTC  ``` That's right. On the other hand, the currently installed package fedora-repos-modular was installed as a dependency, therefore not intentionally and we're looking for a way how to make in user/group installed without running dnf during dnf/rpm transaction.  Or are you referring to different packages than fedora-repos-modular that would be installed back? That is actually requested as a feature in [bug#1814306](show_bug.cgi?id=1814306 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - dnf system-upgrade doesn't install a newly added package from fedora-comps group"). We'd probably make the behavior configurable.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1860408#c4)  Miro Hrončok    2020-07-27 14:30:30 UTC  ``` I am referring to any packages explicitly removed by the user/admin. E.g. if I run `sudo dnf remove fedora-repos-modular` I don't expect it to be reinstalled upon the next upgrade. The same applies to any other package I've removed. See for example [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1845562#c4](show_bug.cgi?id=1845562#c4 "CLOSED ERRATA - system-upgrade plugin should do \"dnf group upgrade\" as part of transaction solution")   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1860408#c5)  Daniel Mach    2020-07-28 09:20:37 UTC  ``` I'm not sure if we have any other options. It's definitely not a good idea to run dnf while it runs already to mark the packages.  Couldn't we document it in the Fedora upgrade guide? That would be the simplest solution with no hacks.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1860408#c6)  Miro Hrončok    2020-07-28 09:36:29 UTC  ``` We can document this in common bugs as well. I just thought the upgrade mechanism would be able to do this kind of things.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1860408#c7)  Jaroslav Mracek    2020-08-10 09:45:28 UTC  ``` Not sure if we are going in right direction, because the problem is caused by change in packaging of fedora-repos or related packages, but the solution is searched in general software-management-tools (the fix for system-upgrade will be not sufficient, because PackageKit and other tools will require it).  From dnf tool perspective we can provide a general mechanism how to handle such a operation. On the other hand, the particular fix must be maintained by distribution and it should not be a part of DNF or DNF plugins.  From practical point of view the revert of removal of require for fedora-repos-modular will be the best way how to resolve the issue. What do you think?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1860408#c8)  Miro Hrončok    2020-08-10 09:52:49 UTC  ``` > From dnf tool perspective we can provide a general mechanism how to handle such a operation. On the other hand, the particular fix must be maintained by distribution and it should not be a part of DNF or DNF plugins.  Works for me.   > From practical point of view the revert of removal of require for fedora-repos-modular will be the best way how to resolve the issue. What do you think?  Well obviously, if we abandon the entire Fedora change and revert it, the problem will be gone, but I'd rather find an actual solution to the problem.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1860408#c9)  Miro Hrončok    2020-08-10 09:55:31 UTC  ``` > the fix for system-upgrade will be not sufficient, because PackageKit and other tools will require it  To clarify: I wanted to get this solved in dnf system upgrade first (or at least talk about it) and later also ask PackageKit, however since PackageKit seems abandoned, I figured here there will be a better chance to move somewhere.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1860408#c10)  Ben Cotton    2020-08-11 15:32:42 UTC  ``` This bug appears to have been reported against 'rawhide' during the Fedora 33 development cycle. Changing version to 33.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1860408#c11)  Pavla Kratochvilova    2020-08-31 07:58:38 UTC  ``` Here is a PR that adds upgrading of groups and environments into system-upgrade: <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf-plugins-extras/pull/183>  It still needs to be tested, but the group upgrade should not install back packages that were explicitly removed or excluded during the groups installation.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1860408#c12)  Fedora Update System    2020-10-08 11:59:47 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-b40fc174b5 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 33. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-b40fc174b5>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1860408#c13)  Fedora Update System    2020-10-08 12:00:44 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-5d9f0ce2b3 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 32. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-5d9f0ce2b3>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1860408#c14)  Fedora Update System    2020-10-08 22:19:53 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-b40fc174b5 has been pushed to the Fedora 33 testing repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1866498#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-08-05 18:04:02 UTC  ``` Librepo fails to sanitize paths in the 'repomd.xml' configuration file. Malformed or malicious repository metadata could allow a remote attacker to copy files outside of the destination directory via path traversal. Considering that DNF runs as root, this flaw could potentially result in system compromise via arbitrary file overwriting of critical system files.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1866498#c4)  Daniel Mach    2020-08-06 14:28:59 UTC  ``` Could you provide more details about the vulnerability that would help us to reproduce and narrow down the problem? Are there any logs or reports we should be aware of? Is the person who discovered this problem able to share more details incl. pointers to the suspicious code? Is there a reproducer?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1866498#c5)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-08-06 15:17:24 UTC  ``` The flaw lies in prepare_repo_download_std_target() and prepare_repo_download_zck_target() in yum.c:   -> <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/librepo/blob/master/librepo/yum.c#L673>   -> <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/librepo/blob/master/librepo/yum.c#L706>  The code concatenates 'handle->destdir' and 'record->location_href' without properly validating the latter, which means a malformed location such as "../../../../" could allow overwriting of arbitrary files stored on the file system. I'm working on a reproducer for this issue, will post additional comments to let you know.  N.B., if I'm not mistaken the version of librepo in RHEL-7 did not include the aforementioned functions, though the same vulnerable lr_pathconcat()/open() can be found in prepare_repo_download_targets(). That's why I consider RHEL-7 to be affected too.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1866498#c8)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-08-07 14:23:17 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue is rated as having Moderate impact on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 because `DNF` is not installed by default. The `DNF` package is available through the Extras channel as an enhancement to YUM 3. Both Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux leverage transport security and package signatures to ship software to their users in a safe way.  Fedora provides a centralized, non-mirrored Fedora-run metalink service which provides a list if active mirrors and the expected cryptographic digest of the `repomd.xml` files. yum uses this information to select a mirror and verify that it serves the up-to-date, untampered `repomd.xml`. The chain of cryptographic digests is verified from there, eventually leading to verification of the .rpm file contents.  Red Hat uses a different option to distribute Red Hat Enterprise Linux and its RPM-based products: a content-distribution network, managed by a trusted third party. Furthermore, the repositories provided by Red Hat use a separate public key infrastructure which is managed by Red Hat. For further information, refer to the following articles.  [1] <https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/1976693>  [2] <https://access.redhat.com/articles/1373143>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1866498#c10)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-08-07 15:44:09 UTC  ``` YUM 3 is not affected by this issue. As mentioned above, the DNF package (YUM 4) is shipped in RHEL-7 via the Extras channel. It's worth noting that the version of librepo in RHEL-7 does not allow file overwriting with arbitrary content; the targeted file ends up being overwritten with an empty file. This is most probably due to the O_TRUNC file status flag: <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/librepo/blob/1.8.1/librepo/yum.c#L577>.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1866498#c11)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-08-10 12:35:23 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Avoid downloading software from untrusted third-party mirrors. Note that under normal circumstances, this flaw does not pose any threat to Red Hat users, as repositories are fully trusted and controlled by Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1866498#c12)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-08-10 13:26:08 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Sergei Iudin <siudin>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1866498#c13)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-08-13 11:15:41 UTC  ``` Created librepo tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1868639](show_bug.cgi?id=1868639 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-14352 librepo: missing path validation in repomd.xml may lead to directory traversal [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1866498#c15)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-08-27 17:05:31 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/rpm-software-management/librepo/commit/7daea2a2429a54dad68b1de9b37a5f65c5cf2600>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1866498#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-09-08 09:41:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:3658 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3658](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A3658)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1866498#c19)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-09-08 13:19:44 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-14351.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-14353.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-14352 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-14352)

#### Description

A flaw was found in librepo in versions before 1.12.1. A directory traversal vulnerability was found where it failed to sanitize paths in remote repository metadata. An attacker controlling a remote repository may be able to copy files outside of the destination directory on the targeted system via path traversal. This flaw could potentially result in system compromise via the overwriting of critical system files. The highest threat from this flaw is to users that make use of untrusted third-party repositories.
