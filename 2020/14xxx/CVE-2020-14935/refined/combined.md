### Description of defect

**References:**

<https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/tree/release/v4.5>

<https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/tree/release/v4.4>

**File:**

[snmp-engine.c](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/blob/release/v4.5/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-engine.c)

[snmp-message.c](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/blob/release/v4.5/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-message.c)

**Analysis:**

Memory access out of buffer boundaries may occur if an SNMP bulk get request with number of OIDs larger than supported by the engine is received and processed.

The OIDs listed in a request are processed by snmp\_message\_decode() function without verification of the varbinds buffer capacity.

The varbinds memory buffer is written with the values provided in SNMP request:

[contiki-ng/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-message.c](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/blob/23db95746afcaa40df3e742a88fc4877d1ec4dd2/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-message.c#L245)

Line 245
in
[23db957](/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/commit/23db95746afcaa40df3e742a88fc4877d1ec4dd2)

|  | buf = snmp\_oid\_decode\_oid(buf, &buf\_len, varbinds[i].oid, &oid\_len); |
| --- | --- |

The buffer capacity is determined by:

[contiki-ng/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-conf.h](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/blob/23db95746afcaa40df3e742a88fc4877d1ec4dd2/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-conf.h#L81-L87)

Lines 81 to 87
in
[23db957](/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/commit/23db95746afcaa40df3e742a88fc4877d1ec4dd2)

|  | #define SNMP\_MAX\_NR\_VALUES SNMP\_CONF\_MAX\_NR\_VALUES |
| --- | --- |
|  | #else |
|  | /\*\* |
|  | \* \brief Default maximum number of OIDs in one response |
|  | \*/ |
|  | #define SNMP\_MAX\_NR\_VALUES 2 |
|  | #endif |

SNMP get bulk requests are processed by snmp\_engine\_get\_bulk() function that allocates a local stack buffer for buffering OIDs of the requested variables.

[contiki-ng/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-engine.c](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/blob/23db95746afcaa40df3e742a88fc4877d1ec4dd2/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-engine.c#L116-L121)

Lines 116 to 121
in
[23db957](/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/commit/23db95746afcaa40df3e742a88fc4877d1ec4dd2)

|  | snmp\_engine\_get\_bulk(snmp\_header\_t \*header, snmp\_varbind\_t \*varbinds, uint32\_t \*varbinds\_length) |
| --- | --- |
|  | { |
|  | snmp\_mib\_resource\_t \*resource; |
|  | uint32\_t i, j, original\_varbinds\_length; |
|  | uint32\_t oid[SNMP\_MAX\_NR\_VALUES][SNMP\_MSG\_OID\_MAX\_LEN]; |
|  | uint8\_t repeater; |

The stack buffer in snmp\_engine\_get\_bulk() is populated with OIDs as a first step before any further processing of the data.

[contiki-ng/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-engine.c](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/blob/23db95746afcaa40df3e742a88fc4877d1ec4dd2/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-engine.c#L123-L130)

Lines 123 to 130

[23db957](/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/commit/23db95746afcaa40df3e742a88fc4877d1ec4dd2)

|  | /\* |
| --- | --- |
|  | \* A local copy of the requested oids must be kept since |
|  | \* the varbinds are modified on the fly |
|  | \*/ |
|  | original\_varbinds\_length = \*varbinds\_length; |
|  | for(i = 0; i < original\_varbinds\_length; i++) { |
|  | snmp\_oid\_copy(oid[i], varbinds[i].oid); |
|  | } |

The varbinds\_length variable value is not verified against the capacity of the temporary oid stack buffer. If the number of requested OIDs exceeds the buffer capacity a stack buffer overflow condition occurs and stack memory beyond the allocated oid buffer is overwritten with OIDs received in SNMP get bulk request.

As the OIDs are supplied in the request content it may be possible to alter the return address from the snmp\_engine\_get\_bulk() function. If the target architecture uses common addressing space for program and data memory (which is common in IoT devices) it may also be possible to supply code in the SNMP request payload and redirect the execution path to the injected code by modification of the return address.

**Type:**

* Out-of-bounds memory write
* Stack memory overwrite
* Return address alteration
* Remote altering of code execution path
* Remote executable code injection
* Remote code execution

**Result:**

* Memory corruption
* Remote code execution
