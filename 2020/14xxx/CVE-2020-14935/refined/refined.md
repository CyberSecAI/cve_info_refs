The provided content is related to CVE-2020-14935.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when processing SNMP bulk get requests. Specifically, the `snmp_engine_get_bulk()` function allocates a fixed-size stack buffer to store OIDs from the request, but does not verify that the number of OIDs in the request does not exceed the buffer's capacity. This results in a stack buffer overflow if the number of OIDs in the SNMP request is greater than the allocated buffer size (`SNMP_MAX_NR_VALUES`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds memory write:**  Writing beyond the allocated stack buffer.
- **Stack memory overwrite:** Overwriting data on the stack, including the return address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Memory corruption:** Overwriting stack memory, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.
- **Remote code execution:** By overwriting the return address on the stack, an attacker may redirect program execution to arbitrary code that they have injected.
- **Remote altering of code execution path:** attacker controls execution flow through the return address modification.
- **Remote executable code injection:** Code can be injected in the request payload if the target architecture uses shared memory for data and code.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker sends a specially crafted SNMP bulk get request with a number of OIDs exceeding the capacity of the stack buffer used by the `snmp_engine_get_bulk()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send SNMP requests to a vulnerable device. No special privileges are required.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in the `snmp-engine.c` and `snmp-message.c` files of the Contiki-NG operating system.
- The `SNMP_MAX_NR_VALUES` configuration, which determines the buffer size, is defined in `snmp-conf.h` and defaults to 2.
- A sample SNMP request that triggers the vulnerability is provided.
- The vulnerability affects Contiki-NG versions 4.4 and 4.5.
