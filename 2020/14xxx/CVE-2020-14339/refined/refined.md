Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14339:

**Root Cause:**
- A file descriptor for `/dev/mapper/control` was unintentionally leaked into the QEMU process by libvirt.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient protection:** The file descriptor for `/dev/mapper/control` was not properly secured, allowing unauthorized access.
- **File descriptor leak:** The file descriptor was passed to the QEMU process, which is not intended to have such access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker within a virtual machine (QEMU guest) could use the leaked file descriptor to perform privileged operations against the device mapper on the host.
- **Host Compromise:** Malicious actions within the guest could lead to serious damage, including compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the host operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to have access to a virtual machine running on a vulnerable libvirt installation.
- **Malicious Guest:** A user or process inside a compromised guest virtual machine exploits the leaked file descriptor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to execute code within a virtual machine hosted by a vulnerable libvirt instance.
- No specific network access is required; the attack is confined to the local host.

**Additional Details from the provided content**

*   **Affected Versions:** libvirt versions prior to 6.7.0 are affected. (Gentoo GLSA 202101-22) , libvirt versions from 6.2.0 to 6.6.0 (Red Hat Bugzilla)
*   **Mitigation:** SELinux in enforcing mode can mitigate the issue by preventing the guest from accessing `/dev/mapper/control`.
*   **Red Hat specific information:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and 8 are not affected because they have older versions of `libvirt`. This flaw was introduced in libvirt version 6.2.0.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux Advanced Virtualization 8 was affected by this issue, and updates were released in RHSA-2020:3586 and RHSA-2020:4676.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is resolved in libvirt version 6.7.0 and later.
*  **Upstream fix:** <https://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commit;h=22494556542c676d1b9e7f1c1f2ea13ac17e1e3e>
