| [Description](#c0)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-07 15:53:15 UTC  ``` The kdebindings ebuild still looks for java in /opt/java (see recent  gento-user report). It needs to be ixed. You (karltk) said you'd do so but  haven't yet, so I'm initially assigning this to you. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-08 12:49:49 UTC  ``` Also a bit off the topic, I think that the JDK and JRE should have the same directory structure (jre in /opt/blackdown-ver/jre/* for both), so that the plugins will stay in the same place, or alternatively, have a $JAVAPLUGINDIR or similar that pointed to the root plugin dir.  This will make things more uniform and easier for stuff like mozilla that adds the symlink for the java plugin.  I know the JDK and JRE packages do it as well, but what if mozilla was merged  *after* JAVA .... ? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-08 12:51:07 UTC  ``` this will also be needed for dev-lang/swig I think. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Karl Trygve Kalleberg (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-12 02:41:02 UTC  ``` The uniformity of a JDK/JRE is a bit tricky, really, since the directory layout is specific to each JDK/JRE. The most-used JDK/JREs are of course those based on the Sun distro, so they are fairly similar. But kissme, japhar, kaffe, sablevm etc are completely different.   Also, some packages rely on the fact that the directory layout is different in the JDK and the JRE packages. We debated having /opt/java around, and having the contents of /opt/java be standardized, but we decided against it at the time, since the offical way of specifying the location of java is the env var JAVA_HOME.  However, we should perhaps cook together a java-config script that can tell us the interesting paths, ie java-config --plugin-dir or java-config --java-home. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-12 03:00:25 UTC  ``` I understand you are perhaps looking for a new, better, global solution. To return to the bug' original topic, if there is somthing already in place, can we quickly change kdbindings to work with that? (e.g to look somewhere else than /opt/java that will work) ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Dan Armak (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-12 03:08:51 UTC  ``` Sorry, just saw you modified the kdebindings ebuild. I'm emergng it now and it's working  (configure recognized the java in the dir specified). So you can close this bug. (I'm not closing it  because of the general java discusion in it).  ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1860069#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-07-23 16:24:34 UTC  ``` It was discovered that libvirt is accidentally leaking a file descriptor for /dev/mapper/control into the QEMU process. This file descriptor allows for privileged operations to be made against device mapper on the host. Thus a malicious QEMU has the potential to do serious damage to the host OS.  Upstream fix: <https://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commit;h=22494556542c676d1b9e7f1c1f2ea13ac17e1e3e>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1860069#c4)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-07-25 14:37:04 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Daniel Berrange (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1860069#c8)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-07-28 08:23:08 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw was introduced in `libvirt` version 6.2.0. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, and 8 are not affected by this issue as they shipped an older version of the `libvirt` package which did not include the vulnerable code.  This issue affects versions of the `libvirt` package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux Advanced Virtualization 8. Future `libvirt` package updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Advanced Virtualization 8 may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1860069#c9)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-07-28 08:38:35 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  This issue is mitigated on Red Hat Enterprise Linux if SELinux is in enforcing mode, which prevents the `/dev/mapper/control` file descriptor from being accessible by a guest user/process.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1860069#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-09-01 09:38:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Advanced Virtualization for RHEL 8.2.1  Via RHSA-2020:3586 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3586](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A3586)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1860069#c12)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-09-01 13:17:34 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-14339>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1860069#c13)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-09-21 12:08:16 UTC  ``` Created mingw-libvirt tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1881035](show_bug.cgi?id=1881035 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-14339 mingw-libvirt: libvirt: leak of /dev/mapper/control into QEMU guests [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1860069#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-11-04 02:52:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:4676 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:4676](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A4676)   ``` |  |
