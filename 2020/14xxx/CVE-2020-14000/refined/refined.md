Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `scratch-vm` library's handling of `project.json` deserialization, specifically the `getExtensionIdForOpcode` function. This function was not properly sanitizing the extension ID, allowing for the injection of arbitrary characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Script Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization of the extension ID in `project.json` allowed for the injection of malicious characters which could be interpreted as a URL, leading to unintended behavior, such as arbitrary fetch requests.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The primary weakness was the absence of validation on the extension ID during the processing of the project file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Fetch Requests:**  A malicious project file could inject a crafted extension ID that, when processed, would trigger a `fetch()` request to an arbitrary URL. This could be used for various malicious activities:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crafting an extension ID that makes repeated requests, an attacker could potentially cause a denial of service to a target.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** If CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) was enabled on the target, an attacker might be able to exfiltrate data.
*   **Unintended Extension Loading:** Malicious crafted project files can load arbitrary extensions by injecting malicious URL in place of extension ID.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Project File:** An attacker crafts a malicious `project.json` file containing a specially crafted extension ID.
*   **User Loads Malicious Project:** The user opens or imports the malicious project in Scratch 3.0 (or a modified environment using the vulnerable library).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create/modify project files:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a project file that would be loaded by a user.
*   **No special user privileges required:** The vulnerability exists in the processing of the project file by the scratch-vm library.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by user "apple502j".
*   The fix implemented was to sanitize the extension ID, only allowing alphanumeric characters and hyphens, to prevent injection of URLs.
*   The vulnerability affected `scratch-vm` versions from `0.1.0-prerelease.1524239808` to `0.2.0-prerelease.20200709173451` (inclusive).
*   The patch was released in version `0.2.0-prerelease.20200714185213`.
*   The pull request that fixed this vulnerability is #2476 [https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-vm/pull/2476](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-vm/pull/2476).
*   The issue was assigned CVE-2020-14000.
* The vulnerability could also affect Scratch Mods with extension support
