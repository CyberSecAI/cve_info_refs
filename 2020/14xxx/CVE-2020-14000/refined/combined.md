### CVE-2020-14000: Script Injection vulnerability in scratch-vm

On June 9th, 2020, me, apple502j, found a vulnerability in scratch-vm, a library used in Scratch 3.0 that handles project.json deserialization. This is patched on July 14th, and has a CVE ID of CVE-2020-14000.

I just filled MITRE's form. It seems like it's actually harder to get ST's attention than MITRE's.

Is there any mention of the vulnerability outside of Scratch and the scratch-vm repository?

Yeah, I've had mixed experiences with reporting vulnerabilities to the scratch team.

It applies to mods with extention support, though many such mods allow loading from URLs anyway.

I'd imagine Scratch Mods that use workers, as I imagine some might do.

Wouldn't the system for loading from a URL be used for extensions? Also, this is not really a huge deal unless it can access storage and/or cookies though. The best way to sanitize the input would probably to use an allowlist for domains instead of just sanitizing any URLs.

This is not the intended mechanics, because getExtensionIdForOpcode is, well… for getting extension ID and not opcode. Ability to make fetch() request itself is enough to be considered as a vulnerability.

Why would there be loadExtensionURL function then that is called by getExtensionIdForOpcode? If it weren't for including extensions not directly in scratch-vm, it must be for loading extensions from URLs. Also, it is sandboxed, so even a fetch request wouldn't be too bad. It's really kind of like the experimental extensions in Scratch 2.0 except that it automatically loads the extension instead of you having to copy and paste into the console.

I think this is because developers either wanted to add “extension URL” field to project.json (but they didn't) - or too lazy to promisify sync API. The problem is there is no warning or similar stuff before loading such extensions.

Perhaps it could be used to DDOS a target if a project abusing this got popular by just constantly spamming requests from every user with the project open. Alternatively, it could be used to spam requests from a different IP (if CORS were enabled on the target).

Yeah, but, again, CORS would have to be enabled on the target and most largely targeted websites have CORS disabled as is the default normally.

### @cwillisf **[cwillisf](/cwillisf)** commented [Jun 16, 2020](#issue-639292784)

### Proposed Changes

When loading an SB3, we determine whether a block is part of an extension by inspecting its "extended" opcode -- for example, `pen_clear` requires the `pen` extension. This change introduces an extra sanitizing step to ensure that the extension ID doesn't contain any characters that might cause problems. Also, this change defines the characters allowed in extension IDs as alphanumerics plus hyphen.

### Reason for Changes

We should always validate user input, and project files count. We validate most of the project file but we weren't validating the extension ID in this case. See also support ticket 229791.

Special thanks to [@apple502j](https://github.com/apple502j) for bringing this to our attention!

### Test Coverage

A new test has been added to verify that characters are replaced appropriately.

Code looks fine to me. I also checked that a selection of core extensions still work as expected. I didn't have a bad extension file to test with. [@ericrosenbaum](https://github.com/ericrosenbaum) perhaps you can check whether this interferes with other allowed extensions.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### **[ericrosenbaum](/ericrosenbaum)** commented [Jul 1, 2020](#issuecomment-652555570)

| So if I understand correctly, the extension manager has its own similar check [here](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-vm/blob/da68c4faf68014bfdfdb1af263910940d96ddd3a/src/extension-support/extension-manager.js#L273), which prevents loading a built-in extension that has an id with non-alphanumeric characters (it's more strict than the changes here, which allow uppercase letters and hyphens). I was playing around with making built-in extensions with weird id values, but none of them would load because of that existing code. So I wasn't able to test this code path in that way. Do you have a suggestion for how I might test it directly, or should we not worry about it? |
