Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14950:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the aapanel's software store settings. Specifically, it allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary commands into the request when interacting with the "start/stop/restart" actions of software listed in the Software Store.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the request parameters. The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to execute malicious commands on the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability highlights a lack of robust input sanitization practices when handling user-supplied input used to construct system commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution with the privileges of the web server process. This allows an attacker to compromise the system, potentially leading to data theft, system takeover, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves exploiting the "Software Store" settings within the aapanel interface.
- Specifically, the attacker intercepts requests sent when "start/stop/restart" actions are initiated for any software listed in Software Store.
- They then modify these requests to inject arbitrary commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the aapanel. This implies the attacker needs valid credentials to access the panel before being able to perform the attack.
- **Access to Software Store Settings:** The attacker needs access to the Software Store section within the aapanel's interface to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content also mentions CVE-2020-14421, which is a separate RCE vulnerability in aapanel, also via command injection through the cron job scheduling feature.
- The provided text mentions that all versions of aapanel up to and including version 6.6.6 are affected by this vulnerability.
- The provided content includes proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited, including screenshots and commands.
