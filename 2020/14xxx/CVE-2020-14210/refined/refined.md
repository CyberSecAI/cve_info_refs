Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14210:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `github.com_b55c35be_20250119_124237.html` directly mentions `CVE-2020-14210` and describes a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MONITORAPP WAF. It provides details about the vulnerability, affected versions, and a solution. The content from `github.com_36c2877e_20250119_124236.html` also discusses the same XSS vulnerability in the context of MONITORAPP AIWAF, which is consistent with the information provided in `github.com_b55c35be_20250119_124237.html` . Therefore, this content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the MONITORAPP WAF's function that responds to request URL information when blocking a request. The WAF fails to properly sanitize or encode the request URL before including it in the response.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The WAF includes the unsanitized request URL in the response, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the blocked response.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the blocked page, which is then executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
        *   Stealing session cookies
        *   Phishing attacks
        *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
        *   Defacing the blocked page
        *   Other client-side attacks
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker sends a crafted request to the web application protected by MONITORAPP WAF. The crafted URL contains malicious JavaScript code.
    *   When the WAF blocks the request, the malicious script within the URL is included unsanitized in the response.
    *   The victim's browser executes the injected script.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send a crafted request to a web application protected by a vulnerable version of MONITORAPP WAF.
    *   No special access privileges on the WAF or web application are required; the attack is client-side.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in the part of the WAF that generates the blocked request page.
*   The WAF is not properly encoding or escaping the request URL before including it in the HTML response.
*   The provided proof of concept shows how a URL containing a `<script>` tag is rendered in the HTML source of the blocked page.

**4. Affected Product Versions:**

*   WAF Versions:
    *   ~ V4.1 B7239
    *   ~ V5.0 B1064

**5. Solution:**

*   Apply the update to the version where the vulnerability is resolved:
    *   V4.1 B7240 ~
    *   V5.0 B1065 ~
*   Temporarily disable the function, if update is not possible.
