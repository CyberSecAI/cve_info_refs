Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an insufficient length check on the `XkbSetMap` request within the X.Org server, leading to an out-of-bounds memory access. This means the server doesn't properly validate the size of the data it's about to process against the expected size, causing it to read or write to memory outside of the intended buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Out-of-bounds memory access:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read or write in the `XkbSetMap` function due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability can lead to privilege escalation on systems where the X server is running with elevated privileges. 
-   **Data Confidentiality and Integrity:** The flaw poses a high threat to data confidentiality and integrity.
-   **System Availability:** System availability can be impacted.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   An authorized client sending a crafted `XkbSetMap` request to the X server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be an authorized client capable of sending requests to the X server.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-14345
- The fix for this vulnerability involves carefully checking the `SetMap` request length to avoid out-of-bounds memory accesses.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is less impacted since the X server doesn't run with root privileges.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jan-Niklas Sohn (Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative).
- Upstream patch available at: <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/commit/446ff2d3177087b8173fa779fa5b77a2a128988b>
- This issue has been addressed in:
   - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 via RHSA-2020:5408
   - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via RHSA-2021:1804
