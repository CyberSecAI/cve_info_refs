The content provided describes two stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Solarwinds Orion Web Console WPM. CVE-2020-14007 is one of the two vulnerabilities.

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating and displaying alerts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the application's database and executed when other users access the affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the alert creation functionality. An attacker with the ability to create alerts can inject XSS payloads into the following fields:
    - 'Name of alert definition'
    - 'Responsible Team'

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the privilege to create alerts within the Solarwinds Orion Web Console.
- The attacker must craft malicious XSS payloads.

**Additional Details:**
- The XSS payload injected into the "Responsible Team" field executes upon visiting the "Alerts" page or clicking on alert details.
- The XSS payload injected into the "Name of alert definition" field executes only when a user clicks on the alert details.
- The vulnerability affects all users, including administrators, who visit the affected pages.
- The affected Solarwinds Orion product is Web Console WPM 2019.4.1, Orion Platform HF4, and NPM HF2 2019.4.
- The provided PoC shows screenshots of the injected payload and its execution in the application.
