## Product

## Author

## CVE ID

<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-14006>

<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-14007>

## Description

A malicious user with privilege to create **"Alerts"** can create an alert and inject XSS payload in it. There are two injection points one point is more critical since it affects two pages.

While creating a new alert, an attacker can inject in **'name of alert definition'** `<svg/onload=alert('name') />` and **'Responsible Team'** `<svg/onload=alert('XSS') />` to cause stored XSS affecting all users including Admins visiting **"Alerts"** page. The payload injected in **'Responsible Team'** will be executed as soon as a user visit **"Alerts"** page or clicking alert's details, However, the injection in **'name of alert definition'** will be executed when a user click on alert details.
