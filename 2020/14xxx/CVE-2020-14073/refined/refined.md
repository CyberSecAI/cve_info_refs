Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-14073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability to embed custom HTML and JavaScript code within PRTG's map designer feature. While this is a legitimate feature for creating interactive maps, it can be abused by malicious users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. By inserting malicious JavaScript code (e.g., `<svg/onload=alert(1)/>`) into the "HTML before" or "HTML after" fields of a map element's properties, an attacker can have this code executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected map.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of other users' browsers. This could lead to a wide range of malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Stealing user credentials.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Modifying the content of the PRTG interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves manipulating the HTML content within the map designer:
    1.  A malicious user with sufficient privileges (Read/Write) creates or edits a map.
    2.  Within the map designer, they access the "Properties" of a map element.
    3.  They insert malicious JavaScript into the "HTML before" or "HTML after" fields.
    4.  When other users view the map, the injected JavaScript code executes in their browsers, resulting in the XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have a valid user account within PRTG.
*   **Read/Write Privileges:** The attacker's account must possess at least read/write permissions to be able to create or edit maps within PRTG.
*   **Map Designer Access**: The attacker needs access to the map designer feature within PRTG.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** All PRTG versions since version 7 are affected by this vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:** There is no direct workaround. Paessler recommends that administrators review user permissions, re-evaluate access rights and delete inactive user accounts. Administrators can also check object history for malicious activity.
*   **Paessler's Response:** Paessler acknowledged the vulnerability and is working on a solution to better control the use of HTML/JavaScript embedding.
*   **Severity:** The CVSS v3.1 score for the related Tabnabbing vulnerability is 2.6, but Paessler considers the severity as Medium.

**Summary:**

The CVE-2020-14073 is a Stored XSS vulnerability in PRTG Network Monitor that arises from the ability to embed HTML and JavaScript code within the map designer. Attackers with read/write privileges can inject malicious code that executes in the browsers of other users who view the modified maps. This can have serious security implications, including arbitrary code execution and data theft. There is no direct mitigation at the moment and Paessler recommends administrators to review user permissions and object history.
