Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14938:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when parsing save game files in FreedroidRPG. Specifically, the `decode_map` and `decode_waypoints` functions allocate fixed-size buffers (4096 bytes) and then copy data into these buffers from the save file, without verifying if the data exceeds the buffer's capacity. This leads to heap-based buffer overflows. There is also a secondary vulnerability in that the game loads LUA code from the save file which allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** Two instances in `map.c`, within `decode_map` and `decode_waypoints`. The code uses `memcpy` to copy data into fixed-size buffers based on lengths parsed from the file without checking for buffer overflows.
*   **Lack of input validation:** The parser does not validate the size of the data read from the save file. It assumes that the data between markers like `beginning_of_map` or `wp` and a newline character will fit within the fixed 4096-byte buffer.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution** The game loads Lua code from the save file which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** Overwriting adjacent memory on the heap may lead to a crash, denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution, although the articles do not confirm the latter.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution** Attackers can craft save games with embedded LUA code to execute arbitrary code on the user's system when loading a crafted save game.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Save Games:** An attacker can craft a malicious save game file (specifically the `*.shp` file within the gzipped archive), modifying the size values (`xlen of this level`, `floor layers`) or by inserting a large number of characters after `beginning_of_map` or `wp` in a way that causes the heap buffer overflow when the game parses it.
*   **LUA Injection** An attacker can craft a malicious save game file (specifically the `*.sav.gz` file) containing malicious LUA code that will execute upon loading the save game.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to modify save files:** An attacker needs to be able to modify the game's save files. This can be achieved by either modifying an existing save file or creating one from scratch.
*   **Social Engineering/Distribution:** The attacker would need to distribute the malicious save file to the victim, either through direct transfer or by hosting it online. The victim would then need to load the malicious save game in FreedroidRPG.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `map.c` file, specifically in the `decode_map` and `decode_waypoints` functions.
*   The exploit is triggered during the loading of a saved game, specifically while decoding level data and waypoint data from the `*.shp` file.
*   The provided proof of concept code demonstrates the vulnerability by modifying the save file and inserting a large amount of 'A' characters to trigger the heap buffer overflow.
*   The arbitrary code execution is achieved by crafting a save file with malicious lua code in the *.sav.gz file.
*   The bug report (issue 951) confirms the vulnerability and provides a link to CVE-2020-14938. It is mentioned that the vulnerability has been resolved by commit 17711a426.
*   The `logicaltrust.net` blog post gives more technical detail and demonstrates a second exploit vector.
