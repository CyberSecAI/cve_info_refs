A container on-entry vulnerability was found in docker and has been assigned  [CVE-2016-9962.](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-9962)  The flaw addresses a specific attack that uses `ptrace`  and improperly-flushed file descriptors to gain access to content outside a container. This attack is only a risk when running privileged containers and is mitigated by SELinux.

This issue was publicly disclosed on **January 10, 2017.**

## Background Information

This vulnerability arises when a process that would normally run in one namespace is launched or moved into a different namespace. Namespaces normally act as a security mechanism because processes within different namespaces cannot see or manipulate one another. The problem is that when a process is moved into a namespace, it becomes exposed to malicious actions from processes that are already in that namespace. On-entry vulnerabilities attack processes that join containers via `nsenter`  or `docker exec`  . A successful attack can result in a malicious process gaining system access or other privileges.

For example, if a malicious process has taken over a container and managed to obtain `root`  within that container, the malicious process can kill any other process it can "see". Fortunately, container namespacing keeps the malicious process from being able to detect or kill any host processes or any of the processes in other containers. However, if an administrator attempts to investigate the issue by using `nsenter`  to move a shell into the misbehaving container, the malicious process can see and manipulate that shell as well (and terminate it).

## Vulnerable Linux Facilities

The following legitimate Linux facilities can be misused in on-entry attacks. Use Linux security mechanisms such as `SELinux`  and `seccomp`  to prevent their exploitation.

* **ptrace**
  "Process trace" or `ptrace`  is a powerful debugging facility that is available in Linux. Any process with adequate permissions can `ptrace`  another process through the `ptrace`  kernel call. `ptrace`  grants extremely low-level access to the process, including its memory, resources (such as file descriptors), and the ability to intercept process kernel calls.
* **docker exec**
  `docker exec`  is a service provided by the docker daemon that allows an additional process to be launched within an existing container. This is often used to inspect or make manual changes to the container. For example, to launch a bash shell within a misbehaving container in order to debug its behavior, you could use:
  `docker exec -it container-name /bin/bash`
* **nsenter
  ​** `nsenter`  is a Linux utility used to move or launch processes within specific namespaces. Because containers are built on Linux namespaces, `nsenter`  can be used as a more generic version of `docker exec`  .
* **kernel capabilities**
  In Linux, the special powers traditionally granted to the `root`  account have been split into individual capabilities, and some grant more than one administrative power. For example, `CAP_SYS_TIME`  grants only the ability to set the system clock. `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`  , on the other hand, grants the range of powers needed to administer a machine. Each kernel capability can be granted or denied to a process individually.
* **seccomp**
  The `seccomp`  Linux facility allows access to kernel calls on an individual basis.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of [Important](http://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/) .

## Impacted Products

The following Red Hat Product versions are impacted:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
* Red Hat Openshift Container Platform
* RHEL Atomic Host

## Impact

The flaw in CVE-2016-9962 occurs because a safety mechanism is missing from `docker exec`  .

Until upstream docker 1.12.6, processes that `docker exec`  launched could be `ptrace`  'd within the container and they briefly kept their file descriptors, which were linked to content outside the container. This could be exploited by a process within a container equipped with `ptrace`  abilities. If a malicious process acted quickly enough, it could `ptrace`  the incoming process and gain access to content outside the container. This has been addressed in docker 1.12.6 by preventing `ptrace`ing of these processes (through the `DUMPABLE`  process attribute) and by having incoming processes flush their file descriptors before being moved.

Even without the backport, most installations are *not* at risk:

* On Red Hat systems with SELinux enabled, the dangers of even privileged containers are mitigated. SELinux prevents container processes from accessing host content even if those container processes manage to gain access to the actual file descriptors.
* In most installations, `nsenter`  and `docker exec`  are purely manual operations. OpenShift uses `nsenter`  to facilitate port-forwarding, but without manual intervention, vanilla docker will never move a process into a container or between containers.

## Diagnose your vulnerability

To check whether your docker version already has the backported fix, download and use  [this script](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/cve-2016-9962.sh)  .

## Take Action

All Red Hat customers running the affected versions of docker are recommended to update when patches are available. Details about impacted packages as well as recommended mitigation are noted below.

## Updates for Affected Products

| Product | Package | Advisory/Update |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 | docker-latest, docker, runc | [RHSA-2017-0116](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0116.html) ,  [RHSA-2017-0123](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0123.html) ,  [RHSA-2017-0127](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0127.html) |
| Red Hat Openshift Container Host | docker-latest, docker | patch applied |
| RHEL Atomic Host | docker-latest, docker, runc | patch applied |

### **Mitigation**

`ptrace`  and other dangerous kernel calls can be banned from your containers. Custom seccomp profiles can be created to forbid this behaviour (supported by vanilla docker, OpenShift, and Kubernetes). This will completely prevent attacks based on CVE-2016-9962.

An attacker can, depending on the nature of the incoming process, leverage this to elevate access to the host. This ranges from accessing host content through the file descriptors of the incoming process to, potentially, a complete container escape by leveraging memory access or syscall interception. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2017-01-18 08:17:37 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c0)  Martin Prpič    2017-01-02 12:23:40 UTC  ``` The following issue was reported in Docker:  RunC allowed additional container processes via `runc exec` to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container.  This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to gain access to file-descriptors of these new processes during the initialization and can lead to container escapes or modification of runC state before the process is fully placed inside the container.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c1)  Martin Prpič    2017-01-02 12:23:52 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Docker project Upstream: Aleksa Sarai (SUSE), Tõnis Tiigi (Docker)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c2)  Martin Prpič    2017-01-02 12:32:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1236624](attachment.cgi?id=1236624 "CVE-2016-9962 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1236624&action=edit "CVE-2016-9962 patch") [CVE-2016-9962](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-9962) patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c8)  Trevor Jay    2017-01-03 18:35:43 UTC  ``` This is an extremely difficult to exploit flaw on standard RHEL and Fedora systems.   I checked the 1.10.3 and 1.12.5 builds on Brew. Both drop the `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` capability by default. 1.10.3 blacklists `ptrace` calls under the default seccomp profile. Thus, this flaw only comes into play for containers that already have elevated privileges.   Even if `ptrace` is available. The proposed exploit scenario of quickly attaching to a process joining the container space and using its file descriptors is *not* possible under the default SELinux configuration. The containerized PID 1 will have a type of `container_t` or similar SELinux type and thus will be blocked by standard type enforcement from accessing accessing any resources that haven't already been made available to containerized processes.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c12)  Andrej Nemec    2017-01-11 08:58:12 UTC  ``` Public via:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q1/54>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c13)  Trevor Jay    2017-01-11 15:27:11 UTC  ``` Created runc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1412238](show_bug.cgi?id=1412238 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2016-9962 runc: docker: insecure opening of file-descriptor allows privilege escalation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c15)  Vincent Danen    2017-01-11 21:34:32 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/cve-2016-9962>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 20:45:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras  Via RHSA-2017:0116 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0116.html>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 20:47:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras  Via RHSA-2017:0123 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0123.html>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-01-17 20:48:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras  Via RHSA-2017:0127 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017-0127.html>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2020-06-17 21:54:22 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  <https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/50a19c6ff828c58e5dab13830bd3dacde268afe5>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1409531#c20)  Jason Shepherd    2020-06-22 01:21:50 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  On Red Hat systems with SELinux enabled, the dangers of even privileged containers are mitigated.
