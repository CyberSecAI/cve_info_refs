Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2016-9962:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way `runc` (a component of Docker) handled process entry into a container via `docker exec` or `nsenter`. Specifically, when a new process joined an existing container, it was briefly vulnerable to being `ptrace`'d by the container's PID 1 process. Additionally, file descriptors linked to content outside the container were not immediately flushed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure `ptrace` Handling:** The primary vulnerability lies in the ability of a container's main process (PID 1), especially if running as root, to use `ptrace` on newly joining processes. `ptrace` grants very low-level access to the process, including its memory, file descriptors, and the ability to intercept syscalls.
*   **Improperly Flushed File Descriptors:** When a process entered a container, it briefly retained file descriptors that might have been linked to resources outside of the container's namespace.
*  **Lack of mandatory protection of `ptrace`:** The vulnerability exists because the `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` capability is not required to exploit it

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious process within a container with `ptrace` capability could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to content outside the container, potentially leading to a container escape and gaining system-level access.
*   **Host Resource Access:** By intercepting the file descriptors of the incoming process, a malicious process can access host files or other resources.
*   **Malicious Code Injection/Memory access:**  Accessing the incoming processes memory through `ptrace` allows a malicious process to gain control over the incoming process and its data.
*   **Container Escape:** By leveraging memory access or syscall interception, a complete container escape is possible, allowing the attacker to control the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`docker exec`:**  A malicious process in a container could exploit the vulnerability when an administrator uses `docker exec` to launch a new process (e.g., a shell) into the container.
*   **`nsenter`:** Similar to `docker exec`, `nsenter` could also trigger the vulnerability when used to move a process into a container.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Compromised Container:** The attacker must first have control of a process within a container and have root privileges within the container itself.
*   **`ptrace` Capability:** The malicious process needs `ptrace` capabilities to exploit this vulnerability (although the `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` capability is not required)
*   **Timing:** The attack requires the malicious process to act quickly enough to use `ptrace` and access the incoming process's file descriptors before they are flushed.

**Mitigation**

*   **SELinux:** SELinux provides mitigation by preventing container processes from accessing host content even if those container processes manage to gain access to the actual file descriptors.
*   **`DUMPABLE` attribute and flushing file descriptors:** This has been addressed in docker 1.12.6 by preventing `ptrace`ing of these processes (through the `DUMPABLE` process attribute) and by having incoming processes flush their file descriptors before being moved.
*   **Seccomp Profiles:** `ptrace` and other dangerous kernel calls can be banned from containers. Custom seccomp profiles can be created to prevent this behavior.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is more significant in privileged containers.
*   The provided content states that this vulnerability was publicly disclosed on January 10, 2017.
*   Red Hat has classified the severity of this flaw as "Important".
*   Patches have been released for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, OpenShift Container Platform, and RHEL Atomic Host.
