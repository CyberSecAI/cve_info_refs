Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-14195:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content explicitly mentions "CVE-2020-14195" and describes the vulnerability as a mishandling of the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing in FasterXML jackson-databind, specifically related to `org.jsecurity.realm.jndi.JndiRealmFactory`. This aligns with the official descriptions of CVE-2020-14195, confirming the content's relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper handling of serialization gadgets in the `jackson-databind` library when combined with polymorphic type handling. This allows an attacker to provide a malicious class for deserialization (specifically using `org.jsecurity.realm.jndi.JndiRealmFactory`), which then executes arbitrary code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core weakness is that the library deserializes data, including class names, from potentially untrusted sources.
*   **Polymorphic Type Handling:** The vulnerability exploits the ability of Jackson to handle polymorphic types (where a base class can have different concrete implementations) when the type information is provided within the serialized data.
*   **Serialization Gadgets:** The attack leverages "serialization gadgets" - classes present on the classpath that, when deserialized, can cause unintended side effects like code execution.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation can lead to:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** Deserialization gadgets could be used to access confidential data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Some gadgets can cause denial of service by disrupting operations or shutting down the server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is the manipulation of JSON content sent by an untrusted client to a server using Jackson library.
*   This includes crafting malicious JSON payloads that exploit the polymorphic type handling and include a gadget class.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Malicious JSON:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted JSON data to an application using a vulnerable version of the Jackson library.
*   **Knowledge of Gadget Classes:** An attacker needs knowledge of classes that can be used as gadgets (e.g., `org.jsecurity.realm.jndi.JndiRealmFactory`), and that are accessible in the applicationâ€™s classpath.
*   **Specific Jackson Configuration:** The application must be configured to use polymorphic type handling of properties, typically `java.lang.Object` or similar permissive tag interfaces
*   **Vulnerable Version of Jackson:** The application must use a vulnerable version of Jackson (>= 2.9.0 and <= 2.9.10.4 in this case).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to make network calls to the vulnerable service.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The issue arises specifically with versions of `jackson-databind` before 2.9.10.5.
*   The `org.jsecurity.realm.jndi.JndiRealmFactory` is mentioned as the specific class being exploited through this vulnerability.
*   The fix involves blocking the deserialization of known dangerous gadget classes.
*   The configuration of `MapperFeature.BLOCK_UNSAFE_POLYMORPHIC_BASE_TYPES` and `activateDefaultTyping()` is mentioned as mitigating factors, specifically on versions 2.11 and 2.10 of the library.
