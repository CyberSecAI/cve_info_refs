Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14014:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization and HTML encoding of the `fid` query parameter in the `/navigate/navigate.php` resource.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User-supplied input in the `fid` parameter is directly reflected back in the HTML response without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Stealing sensitive information
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript in the `fid` parameter.
*   An attacker could trick a user into clicking the malicious link or embed it in another website, which when visited by a victim would trigger the XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to find a way to get the victim to click the crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found in Navigate CMS version v2.9 r1433 (2020/06) but a similar vulnerability was found in version 2.8 as well.
*   The issue is fixed in version v2.9.1 r1487 (2020/06).
