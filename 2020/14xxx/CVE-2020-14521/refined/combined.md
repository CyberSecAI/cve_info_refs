■ Mitigations

For customers who are using a product that has not released a fixed version or who cannot immediately update the product,
Mitsubishi Electric recommends that customers take the following mitigation measures to minimize the risk of exploiting this
vulnerability:

-If a "File Name Warning" message is displayed when starting Windows, take appropriate measures according to the

instructions in the message, such as changing a file name, and then install or operate the products.

-Operate the products under an account that does not have administrator's privileges.
-Install an antivirus software in your personal computer using the products.
-Restrict network exposure for all control system devices or systems to the minimum necessary, and ensure that they are not

accessible from untrusted networks and hosts.

-Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
-Use Virtual Private Network (VPN) when remote access is required.

■ Acknowledgements

Mitsubishi Electric would like to thank Mashav Sapir of Claroty who reported this vulnerability.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on social engineering attacks.
