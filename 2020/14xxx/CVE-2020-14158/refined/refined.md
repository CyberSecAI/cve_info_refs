{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ABUS Secvest Hybrid module lacks security mechanisms to ensure confidentiality and integrity of RF packets exchanged with the ABUS Secvest alarm panel.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing security mechanisms for confidentiality and integrity of RF communication.",
      "Unprotected mapping of input channels to a 4-byte field in RF packets."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass the authentication of wAppLoxx in a system configuration where the ABUS Secvest panel is linked to the wAppLoxx via the Hybrid module. This allows the attacker to disarm the alarm system without user interaction. Additionally, the attacker can simulate changes on the ABUS Secvest Hybrid module inputs.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Spoofing RF messages of the ABUS Secvest Hybrid module.",
      "Sniffing status RF packets issued by the ABUS Secvest Hybrid module."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to sniff and spoof RF packets.  A tool like the YARD Stick One is needed to perform this attack"
