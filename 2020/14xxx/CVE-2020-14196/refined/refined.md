Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-14196:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the PowerDNS Recursor's internal web server not properly enforcing access control lists (ACLs) defined by the `webserver-allow-from` setting. This oversight allows remote attackers to bypass the intended restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The core weakness is the failure to properly validate and enforce the ACL specified for the web server.
*   **ACL Bypass:** Attackers can circumvent the `webserver-allow-from` setting, gaining unauthorized access to the web server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access Restriction Bypass:** A remote attacker can send HTTP requests to the internal web server.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** While the provided information doesn't detail the full extent of actions possible via the web server, the ability to access it could expose other vulnerabilities if they exist.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is launched over the network using HTTP queries.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, not requiring local access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server running the vulnerable PowerDNS Recursor instance.
*   **HTTP client:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests.
*  **Target configuration**: The webserver must be enabled and listening on a non-local address

**Additional notes:**

*   The internal web server is not enabled by default. Only non-default installations are vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability is considered a low severity issue.
*   Workarounds involve disabling the web server, setting a password or API key for it, restricting the web server binding to local addresses, and/or using firewall rules.
*   The issue is fixed in PowerDNS Recursor versions 4.3.2, 4.2.3, and 4.1.17 and later.

This information provides more detail than the original CVE description, which simply notes an "Access restriction bypass" without elaborating on the mechanism or context.
