### @lminiero **[lminiero](/lminiero)** commented [Jun 15, 2020](#issue-638765096) • edited Loading

We've been notified about a couple of security issues related to a broken usage of sscanf (reserved IDs: [CVE-2020-14033](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w68x-w98g-jr89 "CVE-2020-14033"), [CVE-2020-14034](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-43r3-f7j4-6552 "CVE-2020-14034"), discovered by Marat Gayanov at Digital Security dsec.ru). Using that information, we extended the fix to a couple of other locations where the issue was present but not reported.

Merging right away, considering these are important fixes and I can't replicate them anymore.

Sorry, something went wrong.
