- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow in the eCatcher VPN client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) exists. This can allow an attacker to overwrite memory on the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a crash of the device being accessed. Furthermore, it may allow remote code execution with the highest privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device. The attacker does not need any privileges, but user interaction is required. It is also mentioned that only low skill level to exploit is required.
