Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-14332:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Ansible `copy` module, when used in check mode (`--check`), was not properly sanitizing or redacting the `content` parameter from the module invocation details. This meant the actual content being copied could be exposed in logs or event data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is that sensitive data passed as the `content` parameter to the `copy` module would be exposed, particularly when using verbose output (`-vvv`) or in Ansible Tower/AWX event data.
- **Lack of proper sanitization:** The Ansible code did not adequately filter or redact the `content` parameter before displaying the module invocation details in check mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could gain access to the content being copied if they had access to the logs or the Ansible Tower/AWX event data. This could expose sensitive data like passwords, API keys, or other configuration details, thus breaking confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Access to Logs:** An attacker with access to the Ansible logs where the module invocation is written could retrieve the content.
- **Access to Ansible Tower/AWX:** An attacker with unauthorized access to the event data stored in Ansible Tower/AWX could retrieve the content from the stored module invocation details.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be on the target system.
- The attacker needs to have access to logs or Ansible Tower/AWX event data where Ansible module invocations are recorded. This could be through compromised credentials or other means of unauthorized access to the logging system, or the mentioned management platforms.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring the `content` parameter was redacted before displaying module invocation details when running in check mode.
- The fix was applied to multiple versions of Ansible, including versions 2.8.14, 2.9.12 and 2.11, as well as backported to older versions (2.10, 2.9, 2.8).
- The issue primarily manifested when running Ansible in verbose mode or when using Ansible Tower/AWX, where the information was consistently captured in event data.

The provided content offers more detail than the basic CVE description by explaining the specific scenario of how sensitive data can be leaked (via logs/event data) and what specifically caused the issue (lack of redaction for the 'content' parameter).
