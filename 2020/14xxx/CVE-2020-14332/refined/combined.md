| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1857805#c0)  Borja Tarraso    2020-07-16 15:29:59 UTC  ``` module_args is not censored properly when using the check mode. This only happens using -vvv on the CLI, but in AWX/Tower it does not matter what verbosity setting is used, because it is saved in the event data regardless. So sensitive data is exposed allowing unauthorized users accessing to it.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1857805#c3)  Borja Tarraso    2020-07-16 15:48:27 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1857817](show_bug.cgi?id=1857817 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-14332 ansible: module_args does not censor properly in --check mode [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1857818](show_bug.cgi?id=1857818 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-14332 ansible: module_args does not censor properly in --check mode [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1857805#c9)  Borja Tarraso    2020-07-22 11:02:00 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1859535](show_bug.cgi?id=1859535 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2020-14332 ansible: module_args does not censor properly in --check mode [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1857805#c10)  msiddiqu    2020-08-03 05:05:51 UTC  ``` Upstream Fix:  <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71033>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1857805#c12)  Hardik Vyas    2020-08-13 14:21:29 UTC  ``` Statement:  The version of ansible provided in Red Hat Gluster Storage 3, Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and 3 does not contain the vulnerable functionality and is not affected by this vulnerability.

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Ansible, a configuration
management, deployment and task execution system, which could result in
information disclosure or argument injection. In addition a race
condition in become_user was fixed.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.7+dfsg-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.

For the detailed security status of ansible please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ansible>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
