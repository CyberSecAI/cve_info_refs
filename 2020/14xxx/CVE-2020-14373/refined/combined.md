| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=702851#c0)  Todd    2020-08-28 19:59:55 UTC  ``` Overview:  When testing for BZ#701818 in ghostscript-9.25, I found a use-after-free which looks unrelated to that bug. It occurs when the crafted PDF PoC file is provided as input to ghostscript.  Steps to reproduce:  1. Download <https://bugs.ghostscript.com/attachment.cgi?id=18402> 2. Compile ghostscript with AddressSanitizer 3. run:  gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -dSAFER -dNOTRANSPARENCY -sOutputFile=tmp -sDEVICE=xpswrite $PoC  Expected result:  ghostscript displays an error and exits, or otherwise handles the input  Actual result:  ASAN shows that ghostscript performs a use-after-free:  ==[1298203](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?1298203)==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free on address 0x62a000678250 at pc 0x000002664563 bp 0x7ffc94c166a0 sp 0x7ffc94c16690                                                   [16/7539] READ of size 4 at 0x62a000678250 thread T0     #0 0x2664562 in igc_reloc_struct_ptr psi/igc.c:1279     #1 0x1ccd294 in basic_reloc_ptrs base/gsmemory.c:347     #2 0x26683fc in gc_do_reloc psi/igc.c:1246     #3 0x266c017 in gs_gc_reclaim psi/igc.c:450     #4 0x27764da in context_reclaim psi/zcontext.c:290     #5 0x2518dcc in gs_vmreclaim psi/ireclaim.c:163     #6 0x2518dcc in ireclaim psi/ireclaim.c:80     #7 0x24f2b8c in interp_reclaim psi/interp.c:447     #8 0x24bd784 in gs_main_finit psi/imain.c:914      #9 0x53174e in main psi/gs.c:138     #10 0x7f29b4ca71a2 in __libc_start_main ../csu/libc-start.c:308     #11 0x53c28d in _start (/home/moveax41h/analysis/dist-git/ghostscript/ghostscript-9.25/bin/gs+0x53c28d)                                                   0x62a000678250 is located 80 bytes inside of 22536-byte region [0x62a000678200,0x62a00067da08) freed by thread T0 here:                                                                                #0 0x7f29b5c9291f in __interceptor_free (/lib64/libasan.so.5+0x10d91f)     #1 0x1bd5720 in alloc_free_clump base/gsalloc.c:2599  previously allocated by thread T0 here:     #0 0x7f29b5c92d18 in __interceptor_malloc (/lib64/libasan.so.5+0x10dd18)     #1 0x1cb97ae in gs_heap_alloc_bytes base/gsmalloc.c:193  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free psi/igc.c:1279 in igc_reloc_struct_ptr Shadow bytes around the buggy address:                                                                0x0c54800c6ff0: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c54800c7000: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa   0x0c54800c7010: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa     0x0c54800c7020: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa                                                                                                                                        0x0c54800c7030: fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa =>0x0c54800c7040: fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd[fd]fd fd fd fd fd                                0x0c54800c7050: fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd                                     0x0c54800c7060: fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd            0x0c54800c7070: fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd   0x0c54800c7080: fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd   0x0c54800c7090: fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd fd Shadow byte legend (one shadow byte represents 8 application bytes):           Addressable:           00                                                                           Partially addressable: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07    Heap left redzone:       fa                                                                         Freed heap region:       fd            Stack left redzone:      f1                                                                         Stack mid redzone:       f2                                                                         Stack right redzone:     f3                                                                         Stack after return:      f5                                                                         Stack use after scope:   f8                                                                         Global redzone:          f9                                                                         Global init order:       f6                                                                         Poisoned by user:        f7                                                                         Container overflow:      fc                                                                         Array cookie:            ac                                                                         Intra object redzone:    bb                                                                         ASan internal:           fe                                                                         Left alloca redzone:     ca   Right alloca redzone:    cb                    Shadow gap:              cc ==[1298203](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?1298203)==ABORTING   Environmental information: OS: Fedora 31 Software: ghostscript-9.25 Compiler: GCC 9.3.1  Notes:  I'm aware this is an old version of ghostscript, but wanted to share this for informational purposes. I did see BZ#695318, but the backtrace is a bit different there and looks like it could be a different issue. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=702851#c1)  Ray Johnston    2020-08-28 20:44:48 UTC  ``` Please re-test with the 9.53.0 Release Candidate:  <https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl-downloads/releases/tag/ghostpdl-9.53.0rc2>  If it is reproducible, then re-open this bug (change the "Status" to confirmed)  We really don't appreciate someone submitting bugs for old versions -- it takes time, even if it just asking you to test with the latest available (in this case the 9.53.0 Release candidate). Wouldn't you rather have us spending time on things that are actually still problems.  chris-liddell released Ghostscript/GhostPDL 9.25 on Sep 13, 2018 ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=702851#c2)  Ken Sharp    2020-08-29 12:56:35 UTC  ``` (In reply to Todd from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=702851#c0))  > When testing for BZ#701818 in ghostscript-9.25, I found a use-after-free > which looks unrelated to that bug.

The 9.25 release was the 13th September 2018.  In [bug 701818](show_bug.cgi?id=701818 "RESOLVED FIXED - heap-use-after-free at devices/vector/gdevxps.c:1431 in xps_finish_image_path") we can see from the address sanitizer stack that this particular use-after-free isn't present. Now that report was against a SHA representing a commit between releases, in fact from 31st October 2019.  So this tells us that the problem had already been fixed by this point. Using Git bisect I find that the relevant commit was this one:  <https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commit;h=ece5cbbd9979cd35737b00e68267762d72feb2ea>  This was not *intended* to fix this specific problem, but it clearly does.  I would highly recommend using Git bisect in cases like this, its quick (on Linux) it only took me an hour or so to locate this commit, and will find cases like this where a problem was unwittingly fixed as a consequence of something else.  Obviously its up to you whether you choose to take on that commit in order to resolve the use-after-free problem, from our point of view the problem has already been fixed in our current code base.  I've changed the resolution to 'worksforme' as there was a problem here, but its already been resolved. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=702851#c3)  Todd    2020-09-01 16:13:10 UTC  ``` Thanks for looking into it. My intention of course was mostly to inform about the bug for documentation purposes, knowing that this is not even close to the current version.  Appreciate the reference to Git Bisect as this is a useful tool I can add to my toolbox, and the specific commit you referenced.  Just to be comprehensive, I checked it with 9.53.0RC2 in my environment and it did not trigger a use-after-free. Instead, I got this output:  ============================================= ~/Downloads/ghostpdl-9.53.0rc2/sanbin $ ./gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -dSAFER -dNOTRANSPARENCY -sOutputFile=tmp -sDEVICE=xpswrite ~/Downloads/xps_finish_poc.pdf  GPL Ghostscript RELEASE CANDIDATE 2 9.53.0 (2020-08-27) Copyright (C) 2020 Artifex Software, Inc.

Technically it is (I think) *just* still supported for customers (not quite 2 years yet).   > Is it ok to make this public at this point?  Well its been 'fixed', even if its incidentally, for 18 months so I can't see any reason why not. Might be nice to wait for Chris to give it his blessing, seeing as how he owns the bug, but he's on vacation today. Do you mind waiting until tomorrow for a response from him ? ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=702851#c5)  Todd    2020-09-01 16:39:53 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ken Sharp from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=702851#c4)) > Do you mind waiting until tomorrow for a response from him ?
