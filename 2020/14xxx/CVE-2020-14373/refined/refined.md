Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14373:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the `igc_reloc_struct_ptr()` function within the `psi/igc.c` file of Ghostscript.
- The root cause is related to improper handling of font data within a crafted PDF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability:  The `igc_reloc_struct_ptr()` function accesses memory that has already been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A local attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted PDF file to Ghostscript, causing a crash due to the use-after-free condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted PDF file as input to the Ghostscript interpreter.
- This can be done by an attacker who has access to the system where Ghostscript is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted PDF file to a vulnerable Ghostscript instance. This typically means the attacker has local access to the system or has a way of getting the vulnerable application to process the malicious PDF.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in Ghostscript version 9.25.
- It was fixed in a commit that was not specifically intended to resolve this issue, but did so as a side effect: `ece5cbbd9979cd35737b00e68267762d72feb2ea`.
