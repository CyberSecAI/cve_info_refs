- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient bounds checking in the SNMP agent's OID handling functions (`snmp_oid_cmp_oid`, `snmp_oid_encode_oid`, and `snmp_oid_decode_oid`). These functions do not properly validate the length of the OID data against the buffer sizes when parsing an SNMP request or assembling a response. Specifically, the `snmp_oid_decode_oid` function trusts the length value encoded in the BER format of the SNMP message without verifying it against the remaining buffer size, leading to potential out-of-bounds reads. Additionally, the length of the target buffer is not checked when writing decoded OID, also leading to potential out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Out-of-bounds memory read: The `snmp_oid_decode_oid` function can read beyond the provided input buffer due to a lack of length validation against the remaining buffer length.
    - Out-of-bounds memory write: Due to missing bounds checks,  `snmp_oid_decode_oid` can write beyond the allocated buffer, overwriting adjacent memory regions. `snmp_oid_copy` and `snmp_oid_encode_oid` also do not perform bounds checks when writing to the destination buffer.
    - Uninitialized variable: The `oid_len` variable is not initialized in `snmp_message.c` before being passed to `snmp_oid_decode_oid`, which makes the overflow check in `snmp_oid_decode_oid` ineffective.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to:
    - Memory corruption: Writing outside of allocated buffers corrupts adjacent memory.
    - Arbitrary memory write: By crafting a malformed SNMP request with OID lengths larger than `SNMP_MSG_OID_MAX_LEN`, an attacker can overwrite stack or .bss memory regions with attacker-controlled data.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP request with a malformed OID to a vulnerable device running the affected Contiki-NG versions. The malformed OID would have a length value that leads the vulnerable functions to read or write out of bounds.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send SNMP messages to the targeted device. This usually means the attacker has network access to the device's SNMP service.
