Product: Viber Windows Desktop Application
Developer: Rakuten Viber (part of Rakuten Inc.)
Vulnerability: Unquoted URI handler
Affected Versions: All versions up to 13.2.0.39
The fix for CVE-2019-12569 was incomplete. Before the fix for CVE-2019-12569
an attacker could embed a malicious iframe in a website with a crafted
URL ()
that would launch the Viber Windows desktop client with a malicious
platformpluginpath, a Qt5 framework built-in parameter. The
platformpluginpath parameter specifies a plugin path from which
Viber (built on Qt5) would load plugins (special DLLs). An attacker
could specify a remote SMB share to load malicious plugins from and
achieve remote code execution. After fixing CVE-2019-12569, the client
would no longer load Qt5 plugins from the remote SMB share; however,
the remote SMB share was still opened. Windows will perform NTLM
authentication when opening the SMB share and that request can be
relayed (using a tool like responder) for code execution (or captured
for hash cracking). This issue was remediated by quoting the
parameters passed by the viber URI handler -- URL:Viber Link
C:\Users\jeffssh\AppData\Local\Viber\Viber.exe "%1".

# Private and secure messaging

All around the world, users turn to Viber to have open and authentic conversations with their friends, family and colleagues. With Viber you can rest assured, knowing that your personal chats are always protected and private and that all your conversations are your own. Our mission is to protect that privacy so you never have to think twice about what you can or can‚Äôt share when you‚Äôre using Viber.

Your browser does not support the video tag.

### We don‚Äôt read or listen to any of your chats and calls

Unlike some other messaging apps, Viber can‚Äôt read your personal chats (one-on-one chats and group chats) or listen in on your one-on-one audio or video calls. We use end-to-end encryption by default, so no need to go out of your way to turn it on. Your private and group communications are completely safe so that only you and the people you‚Äôre talking to can read or hear them.

### We can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt sell what you share

When your chats are protected by end-to-end encryption, no one can access them. Perhaps most importantly, Viber doesn‚Äôt have access to them‚Äîwhich means nothing you share can be used by Viber or 3rd parties to target you with ads later. Some other messaging apps don‚Äôt offer end-to-end encryption by default‚Äîhence they can access, read, and sell your private conversations to others for advertising purposes.

### More than encryption

Not only are your communications protected by end-to-end encryption by default, but nothing you share is ever stored on Viber‚Äôs servers once delivered.¬†Messages you send make their way from your device to the recipient as an encrypted code. If the recipient‚Äôs phone is off or they don‚Äôt have an internet connection‚Äîyour message will wait patiently on Viber‚Äôs servers for a limited time only‚Äîstill safe and encrypted‚Äîuntil their device is set to receive and decrypt it.

## 100% privacy you can trust

6 ways to ensure your message, chats, and calls are completely private and also empower you with more privacy when you want it.

### End-to-end encryption by default

Messages you send make their way from your device to the recipient‚Äôs in the form of an encrypted code that only their device can translate to plain text using an encryption key.

Encryption keys exist only on user devices and nowhere else. So no one‚Äînot even Viber‚Äîcan read your messages.

### Disappearing Messages

Set a self-destruct timer for every message in your chat so that after your message is read, it is automatically deleted from the Viber chat‚Äî all sides of the conversation.

While its ON, screenshot actions will be notified in the chat. Privacy is privacy üòâ

### Edit & Delete Messages for All

Sending a message with a typo can be annoying, but don‚Äôt stress‚Äîjust long tap the message and quickly fix it.

If you still want to, delete the sent message on all sides of the conversation, even if it was already seen. You control what you share.

Viber‚Äôs security protocol was based on the ‚Äúdouble ratchet‚Äù protocol found in Open Whisper Systems Signal application, with our own proprietary implementation and additions. Our entire security overview is available [here](https://www.viber.com/app/uploads/viber-encryption-overview.pdf).
