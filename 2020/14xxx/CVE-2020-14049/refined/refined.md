Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an unquoted URI handler in the Viber Windows Desktop Application. Specifically, the application uses a URI handler (`viber://`) that passes parameters to the executable without proper quoting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unquoted URI Handler:** The core issue is the lack of proper quoting when passing parameters from the URI handler to the Viber executable. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands or parameters.
*  **NTLM Relay Vulnerability:** Although the initial vulnerability of loading malicious plugins from SMB share was fixed, the application still opens the provided remote SMB share. This triggers NTLM authentication, which can be relayed to gain further access or capture hashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **NTLM Relay Attacks:** By exploiting the unquoted URI handler and forcing an SMB connection, an attacker can perform an NTLM relay attack. This can lead to:
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** By relaying the NTLM authentication to a target server, an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution on that server.
    *   **Credential Theft:** The NTLM authentication hashes can be captured and cracked offline, potentially leading to credential compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker can embed a crafted `viber://` URL in a website, an email, or any other medium where a user might click it.
*   **Crafted URI:** The attacker crafts a `viber://` URI containing a malicious path to trigger the vulnerability and force the application to make a connection to the attacker's SMB share.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Attacker-Controlled Server:** The attacker needs access to an SMB share under their control to receive the NTLM authentication requests.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to click on the crafted `viber://` URI for the attack to be initiated.
*   **Network Access:** The user's system needs to have network connectivity to the attacker's controlled server.

**Additional Details:**
*   The initial vulnerability (CVE-2019-12569) involved loading malicious plugins via the `platformpluginpath` parameter, which was addressed, but the underlying issue with URI handling remained.
*   The fix involves quoting the parameters passed by the Viber URI handler, ensuring that malicious commands cannot be injected.

In summary, the vulnerability is an unquoted URI handler that, despite an initial fix for remote plugin loading, still enabled NTLM relay attacks by forcing a connection to an attacker-controlled SMB share. This could lead to remote code execution or credential theft.
