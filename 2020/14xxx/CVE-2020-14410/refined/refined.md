Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14410:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer over-read in the `Blit_3or4_to_3or4__inversed_rgb` function within the `video/SDL_blit_N.c` file of the SDL2 library.
*   This occurs when processing a crafted BMP file that has malicious parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap-based buffer over-read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in heap memory. This means that the software attempts to read data from a memory location outside the allocated buffer, which can lead to various security issues and possible crashes.
*   **Lack of proper bounds checking:** The code processing the BMP file fails to sufficiently validate the size and parameters within the file. This allows the crafted file to cause an over-read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the application due to the out-of-bounds memory access.
*   **Possible remote code execution (RCE):** Although not explicitly stated, a heap-based buffer over-read could potentially be leveraged for more severe impacts such as remote code execution, if an attacker can control the read location and use it to leak data to prepare further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted BMP file:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted BMP image file. An attacker would need to create a BMP file with malicious parameters that trigger the vulnerability when processed by the SDL2 library.
*   **Application processing BMP file:** Applications using the vulnerable versions of SDL2 that load and process BMP images would be susceptible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide a malicious BMP file:** The attacker needs to be able to provide an application that uses SDL2 with a crafted BMP file either through local file or remotely if the application is processing files from network resources
*   **Targeting an application using SDL2:** The attacker must target an application that uses the vulnerable version of SDL2 and calls the affected functions while processing a BMP file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered in the `Blit_3or4_to_3or4__inversed_rgb` function, suggesting this is related to image pixel manipulation when blitting/copying of images.
*   The fix involves changes to `SDL_CalculatePitch()` and `SDL_CreateRGBSurfaceWithFormat()` within `video/SDL_surface.c` to prevent the malicious input from reaching the vulnerable functions, suggesting that the root of the problem was in how the library is calculating the pixel data when the image surface is being created.
*   The patch was released quickly to address the vulnerability, and there are multiple updates from various distributions (Debian, Fedora, Gentoo) that have addressed this issue by backporting the fix.
*   The related commit on libsdl hg repository includes also fix for CVE-2020-14409
