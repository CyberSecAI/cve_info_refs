  "cveId": "CVE-2020-14943",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_668cead9_20250119_133109.html",
      "rootCause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'Firstname' and 'Lastname' parameters.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious user can inject malicious, unencoded scripts, such as `<script>alert(1)</script>`, into the 'Firstname' and 'Lastname' parameters of a user account. This stored XSS will execute on nearly every application page as these parameters are always present while logged in.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "The 'update user profile' feature in the application."
      ],
       "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be a logged-in user."
    },
    {
      "source": "github.com_22abe846_20250119_133111.html",
      "rootCause": "The 'Firstname' and 'Lastname' parameters within the user profile update feature are vulnerable due to lack of input sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stored/Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, disclosure of internal application data, and credential theft via phishing.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "The 'update user profile' feature in the application."
      ],
        "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be a logged-in user."

        {
      "source": "github.com_d2b0275f_20250119_133110.html",
      "rootCause": "The 'Firstname' and 'Lastname' parameters in the application lack proper input validation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "Malicious scripts can be injected and stored in the user's profile, leading to execution on application pages, potentially resulting in session hijacking, account takeover, data disclosure and credential theft.",
