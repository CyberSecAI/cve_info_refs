* **CVSS v3 10.0**
* **ATTENTION:** Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit
* **Vendor:** Secomea
* **Equipment:** GateManager
* **Vulnerabilities:** Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character, Off-by-one Error, Use of Hard-coded Credentials, Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to gain remote code execution on the device.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of GateManager, a VPN server, are affected:

* All versions prior to 9.2c

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF NULL BYTE OR NUL CHARACTER CWE-158](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/158.html)

An attacker can send a negative value and overwrite arbitrary data.

[CVE-2020-14500](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-14500) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.2    [OFF-BY-ONE ERROR CWE-193](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/193.html)

The affected product is vulnerable to an off-by-one error, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.

[CVE-2020-14508](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-14508) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.3    [USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)

The affected product contains a hard-coded credential for telnet, allowing an unprivileged attacker to execute commands as root.

A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.4    [USE OF PASSWORD HASH WITH INSUFFICIENT COMPUTATIONAL EFFORT CWE-916](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/916.html)

The affected product uses a weak hash type, which may allow an attacker to view user passwords.

[CVE-2020-14512](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-14512) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is (A[V:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Critical Manufacturing
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Denmark

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Sharon Brizinov and Tal Keren of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Secomea has released a new version to mitigate the reported vulnerabilities. The most up-to-date release at the time of this CISA advisory can be found on the [Secomea website](https://kb.secomea.com/helpdesk/KB/View/25546482-downloads-gatemanager).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
