Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-14512:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from the use of a password hash with insufficient computational effort. This means the hashing algorithm used to store user passwords is weak and easily reversible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **CWE-916 (Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort):**  The system uses a weak hashing algorithm for storing passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker could potentially view user passwords.
* The CVSS score indicates a High impact on Confidentiality (C:H) and no impact on Integrity or Availability (I:N/A:N).

**Attack Vectors:**
* Network-based attack (AV:N)
* Low attack complexity (AC:L)
* No privileges required (PR:N)
* No user interaction needed (UI:N)
* Scope is unchanged (S:U)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device.
* No prior authentication or user interaction is required.

**Additional Information:**
* The document references CVE-2020-14512 and provides the CVSS v3 base score (9.1) and vector string.
* The affected product is Secomea GateManager, and all versions prior to 9.2c are vulnerable.
* The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially view user passwords because of weak hashing.

This information is consistent with the description of CVE-2020-14512 which deals with weak password hashing.
