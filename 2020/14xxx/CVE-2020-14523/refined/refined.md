{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Path traversal vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-22"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious attacker can execute arbitrary code by exploiting the path traversal vulnerability. Specifically, by crafting a malicious project file/configuration data file, they can rewrite arbitrary executable files and library files if the user has administrator privileges. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted project file/configuration data file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious project file or configuration data file and convince a user to open the file using a vulnerable Mitsubishi Electric FA product. If the user has administrator privileges, the impact is greater, allowing arbitrary code execution."
