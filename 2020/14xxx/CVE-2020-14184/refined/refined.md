- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Jira issue filter export files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data (full name) when included in Jira issue filter export files, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they open the exported filter file.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exporting Jira issue filters, where a malicious full name, which is not properly sanitized in the export file, is then opened by a user, leading to XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to modify or control the full name field that will be included in an issue filter export file.
