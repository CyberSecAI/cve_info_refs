Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14307:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way Wildfly handles EJB (Enterprise Java Beans) SessionOpenInvocations. Specifically, these invocations are not properly removed from the remote InvocationTracker after a response is received by the EJB client and server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The failure to remove `SessionOpenInvocations` from the `InvocationTracker` leads to a buildup of these objects over time. This can exhaust server resources.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The accumulation of unremoved `SessionOpenInvocations` can cause the service to become unavailable due to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Service Unavailability:**  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a Denial of Service, rendering the affected service unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The server's resources, specifically those related to tracking EJB invocations, are consumed, which can further impact performance of other functionalities of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted EJB Requests:** An attacker can craft EJB requests that trigger the creation of `SessionOpenInvocations` without ensuring the proper removal of these objects.
*  **Remote Invocation:** The vulnerability occurs in the context of remote invocations between EJB client and server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send EJB requests to the vulnerable server, implying some level of network access.
*   **EJB Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the EJB interface.
