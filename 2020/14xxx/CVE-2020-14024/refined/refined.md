      "root_cause": "The Ozeki SMS Gateway software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in multiple fields and parameters before displaying them in the web interface. This leads to stored and reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.",

        "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
        "Improper input sanitization",
        "Lack of output encoding"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities can lead to:\n\n*   Stealing user session cookies, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users.\n*   Serving custom HTML pages or forms to other users, potentially leading to phishing attacks for stealing authentication credentials.\n*   Performing malicious actions in the context of the victim's browser, such as cryptocurrency mining or other unauthorized activities.",

        "HTTP GET requests with malicious parameters",

       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the server or manipulate the vulnerable fields in the Ozeki SMS Gateway software interface. In the case of stored XSS, the attacker needs to be able to trigger a scenario where the malicious data is stored by the application and later rendered to other users. In the case of reflected XSS, the attacker needs to lure the victim into clicking a malicious link."
