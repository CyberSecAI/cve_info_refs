- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user input in the "Aliases" feature, specifically within the Alias and Real URL textboxes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Transmitting private data (like cookies or session information) to the attacker.
    - Redirecting the victim to attacker-controlled web content.
    - Performing other malicious operations on the user's machine.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the Alias or Real URL fields when creating a new alias within the admin panel. The XSS payload is then reflected back to the user when the page is rendered by the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the admin interface.
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to access and edit aliases under the "Web > Web sites" section.
