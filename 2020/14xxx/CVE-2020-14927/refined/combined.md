## Description

![@tranvannam186](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35331850?v=4&size=48)[tranvannam186](https://github.com/tranvannam186)opened [on Jun 19, 2020](https://github.com/NavigateCMS/Navigate-CMS/issues/19#issue-641699890)

**Expected behaviour**

An authenticated malicious user can take advantage of a Reflected XSS vulnerability in the **name=**"**Aliases**" feature.

**Impact**

Commonly include transmitting private data, like cookies or other session information, to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user’s machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Log into the Admin.
2. Go to function "Web > Web sites"
3. Go to "create > Aliases > add"
4. add "// # "><svg/onload=prompt(/NamTV/)>" in textbox Alias and Real URL.
5. Click "save".
