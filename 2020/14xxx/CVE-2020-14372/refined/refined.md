Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-14372:

**1. Verification of Content Relevance:**

The provided documents contain information directly related to **CVE-2020-14372**, specifically focusing on a vulnerability within the GRUB2 bootloader.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `acpi` command in GRUB2 when Secure Boot is enabled. Specifically, the `acpi` command in GRUB2 does not properly enforce Secure Boot restrictions, allowing for the loading of untrusted ACPI tables.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **UEFI Secure Boot Bypass:** The vulnerability allows a privileged attacker to bypass UEFI Secure Boot protections by loading a crafted ACPI table.
    *   **ACPI command abuse:** The `acpi` command within GRUB2 allows for the loading of crafted ACPI tables even when Secure Boot is enabled, violating the secure boot process.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The lack of proper input sanitization within GRUB2's `acpi` command allows the loading of malicious ACPI tables.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **UEFI Secure Boot Circumvention:** An attacker can bypass Secure Boot, which usually ensures only trusted software is loaded during system boot.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A crafted ACPI table can overwrite the Linux kernel lockdown variable, allowing the loading and execution of unsigned kernel modules or arbitrary code using kexec.
    *   **Sensitive Data Disclosure, Data Modification or Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation can lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system to modify the GRUB configuration file and load a malicious SSDT.
    *   **Boot process manipulation:** The attacker needs to modify the GRUB configuration to load malicious ACPI tables during boot.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Privileged Access:** The attacker requires root-level privileges to modify the GRUB configuration and place the malicious SSDT in the EFI partition.
    *   **Secure Boot Environment:** The vulnerability is specifically exploitable on systems that have UEFI Secure Boot enabled.
    *   **Knowledge of memory layout:** A successful attack requires knowledge of where the kernel's lockdown variable is located in memory to create an effective malicious SSDT.

**3. Additional Technical Details and Observations:**

*   **NetApp Products:** Multiple NetApp products using GRUB2 versions prior to 2.06 are vulnerable, including NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault) and ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as "High" with a CVSS score of 7.5 by NetApp, while Red Hat classifies it as "Moderate" impact.
*   **Workaround:** No workarounds are available for the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:** The primary mitigation strategy is upgrading GRUB2 to version 2.06 or higher, which includes fixes for this vulnerability.
*   **Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT):** The document mentions the introduction of SBAT, a new mechanism to target revocations in UEFI binaries. This will be included in an updated shim package.
*   **Red Hat's Fix:** Red Hat will be introducing a new SBAT mechanism within the shim package to address this and other similar vulnerabilities in GRUB2. The update also includes conflict resolution with older versions of fwupd and marking signed shim packages as protected in DNF.
*   **NetApp Fixes:** NetApp provides a fixed version of ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility and explicitly notes that NetApp Cloud Backup has no plans to address the vulnerability, directing users to the End of Availability (EOA) announcement.
*   **Fedora:** Fedora also released an update for its shim package to address CVE-2020-14372 and other related CVEs.
*   **Red Hat's assessment:** Red Hat notes that a successful exploit requires the attacker to triage the environment to find where the lockdown variable is placed in memory, then write an SSDT with this information and modify the GRUB config to load the SSDT.
*   **CVSS Vector:** NetApp provides the CVSS vector as "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"

**4. Summary of Key Points:**

The core issue lies in GRUB2's failure to properly enforce Secure Boot restrictions during ACPI table loading. This allows a privileged attacker to inject malicious code into the boot process, leading to a variety of potential impacts.  The vulnerability is present in multiple products, including some NetApp and Red Hat offerings, as well as being present in Fedora systems. Upgrading the GRUB2 package and related boot components is the suggested remediation.
