Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14367:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of the PID (Process ID) file creation by the `chronyd` daemon. Specifically, when creating the PID file, `chronyd` doesn't check for existing symbolic links with the same name. This allows an attacker to create a symbolic link that points to an arbitrary location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insecure PID File Handling**: The core issue is the lack of validation when creating the PID file. The daemon does not verify if a symbolic link exists at the intended PID file path.
-   **Symbolic Link Vulnerability**: An attacker can exploit the insecure file handling by creating a malicious symbolic link at the location where `chronyd` will attempt to create its PID file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Data Loss:** By using a symlink to point to a sensitive system file, the `chronyd` process will write its PID to that file, leading to data corruption or loss of that file's content.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** If the symbolic link is made to point to a critical system file, writing to that file can cause system instability, application malfunction, or a complete DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system where `chronyd` is running to create a symbolic link.
-   **Compromised chrony User Account:** The attacker must compromise a user account that has write access to the directory where the PID file is stored (e.g., the chrony user account). The default location `/var/run/chrony` is usually writable by the chrony user.
-   **Root privileges:** While the attacker does not directly need root access, they are leveraging the root privileges `chronyd` uses during startup to write to the file pointed to by the symlink.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local User Account:** An attacker needs a local user account with write permissions to the directory containing the PID file.
-   **Ability to create symlinks:** The attacker needs the ability to create symbolic links on the target system.
-   **Timing:** The attack must be performed before the `chronyd` service starts.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability was addressed in chrony version 3.5.1 by adding checks for symbolic links before writing the PID file and creating a new file.
-   The vulnerability impacts multiple distributions, including Fedora, Ubuntu and Gentoo.
-   The vulnerability was reported by Matthias Gerstner of SUSE.
