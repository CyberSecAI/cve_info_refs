## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 391 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2765149.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Additional patches are included in this Critical Patch Update for the following non-exploitable CVEs in this Oracle product family:

* Oracle E-Business Suite Information Discovery
  + Installer (Apache Log4j): CVE-2020-9488.

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 9 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  8 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2021 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2749094.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2749094.1).

I've tried to execute some Go applications installed via zypper but they all are failed with the same message: "Illegal instruction (core dumped)". Packages I tried: docker 19.03.5_ce-4.1, hub 2.14.2-1.2, and rclone 1.48.0-1.2 ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1169832#c1)  Konstantin Malanchev   2020-04-19 12:25:34 UTC  ``` blackpi:~ # gdb hub GNU gdb (GDB; openSUSE Tumbleweed) 8.3.1 Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

At the same time SSE has been never considered as a part of i586 instruction set.  Machinery also had the similar issue in the past: <https://github.com/SUSE/machinery/pull/2245>   As far as I can see, armv6hl packages are being built within armv7hl virtual machine with armv6hl user environment. So GOARM=6 environment variable has to be set manually, since auto-detection is probably incorrect. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1169832#c3)  Matwey Kornilov   2020-05-05 07:49:56 UTC  ``` "vmov.f32 s0, #112" requires at least VFPv3 to work with immediate constants:  <http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/armasm/armasm_dom1361289962081.htm>  So, I suppose this is a leftover from armv7l architecture. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1169832#c4)  Matwey Kornilov   2020-06-06 07:07:23 UTC  ``` Guillaume,  It seems that currently build environment on OBS makes go to think that it runs on armv7l.

Do you have any ideas?  Indeed, we need to set GOARM=6 at build time to ensure only armv6 instructions and vfpv1 instructions are used. I will prepare some SRs. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1169832#c6)  Guillaume GARDET   2020-06-08 08:32:52 UTC  ``` SR for: * go 1.4:  <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/812469> * go 1.9:  <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/812467> * go 1.10: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/812463> * go 1.11: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/812462> * go 1.12: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/812464> * go 1.13: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/812465> * go 1.14: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/812466>  I set the values for armv7 as well, since we may have OBS worker based on qemu with 64-bit kernel and 32-bit userspace in the future. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1169832#c7)  Matwey Kornilov   2020-06-08 09:04:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to Guillaume GARDET from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1169832#c6)) > SR for: > * go 1.4:  <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/812469> > * go 1.9:  <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/812467> > * go 1.10: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/812463> > * go 1.11: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/812462> > * go 1.12: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/812464> > * go 1.13: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/812465> > * go 1.14: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/812466> >  > I set the values for armv7 as well, since we may have OBS worker based on > qemu with 64-bit kernel and 32-bit userspace in the future.
