{
  "CVE-2020-14039": {
    "Description": "In Go before 1.13.13 and 1.14.x before 1.14.5, Certificate.Verify may lack a check on the VerifyOptions.KeyUsages EKU requirements (if VerifyOptions.Roots equals nil and the installation is on Windows). Thus, X.509 certificate verification is incomplete.",
    "Root cause": "The `Certificate.Verify` method in the `crypto/x509` package of Go does not properly check EKU requirements when `VerifyOptions.Roots` is nil on Windows systems.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete X.509 certificate verification",
      "Lack of proper EKU (Extended Key Usage) checks"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could potentially bypass intended certificate verification, potentially leading to the use of unauthorized certificates.  This could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks or other security compromises.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network attacks",
      "Exploiting flawed certificate verification"
    ],
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to present a certificate that does not comply with the EKU requirements but passes the insufficient check performed by the vulnerable Go version on Windows systems."
  },
  "CVE-2020-15586": {
    "Description": "Go before 1.13.13 and 1.14.x before 1.14.5 has a data race in some net/http servers, as demonstrated by the httputil.ReverseProxy Handler, because it reads a request body and writes a response at the same time.",
    "Root cause": "A data race occurs in `net/http` servers, particularly when using `httputil.ReverseProxy`, due to concurrent reading of the request body and writing of the response.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Data race",
      "Concurrent access to request body and response writer"
    ],
    "Impact": "This could potentially cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) by crashing the application or causing unexpected behavior due to race conditions.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network attacks targeting vulnerable HTTP servers",
        "Sending requests that trigger the data race"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to send carefully crafted requests to the vulnerable HTTP server to trigger the race condition and cause a denial of service."
