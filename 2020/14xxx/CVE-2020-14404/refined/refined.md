Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14404:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `libvncserver/rre.c` file of the LibVNCServer library.
*   It stems from how the library handles encodings, specifically within the RRE (Raster-to-Raster Encoding) function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds access:** The core issue is that the code allows access beyond the boundaries of allocated memory when processing RRE encodings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to a crash of the LibVNCServer, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Possible Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly confirmed, some sources suggest that this vulnerability could potentially be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Information Disclosure (Limited):** The Siemens advisory mentions potential information disclosure but the primary issue remains out-of-bounds access leading to a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:**  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through the VNC protocol.
*   **Manipulated Encodings:** Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by sending specially crafted RRE encodings to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable LibVNCServer.
*   **VNC Client:** They would likely need a VNC client capable of sending crafted encodings.
*   **Knowledge of VNC Protocol:** The attacker needs knowledge of the VNC protocol to send malicious RRE encodings to trigger the vulnerability.
