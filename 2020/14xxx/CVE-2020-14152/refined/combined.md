Package        : libjpeg-turbo
Version        : 1:1.5.1-2+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-1152 CVE-2018-14498 CVE-2020-13790 CVE-2020-14152
Debian Bug     : 902950 924678 962829

Several vulnerabilities were fixed in libjpeg-turbo,
a widely used library for handling JPEG files.

CVE-2018-1152

    Denial of service vulnerability caused by a divide by zero when
    processing a crafted BMP image in TJBench.

CVE-2018-14498

    Denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application
    crash) via a crafted 8-bit BMP in which one or more of the color
    indices is out of range for the number of palette entries.

CVE-2020-13790

    Heap-based buffer over-read via a malformed PPM input file.

CVE-2020-14152

    jpeg_mem_available() did not honor the max_memory_to_use setting,
    possibly causing excessive memory consumption.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1:1.5.1-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libjpeg-turbo packages.

For the detailed security status of libjpeg-turbo please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libjpeg-turbo>
