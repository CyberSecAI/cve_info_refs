Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-14152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `jpeg_mem_available()` function within the libjpeg-turbo library. This function did not properly respect the `max_memory_to_use` setting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper bounds checking or resource management. Specifically, the `jpeg_mem_available()` function failed to enforce the specified memory limits set by `max_memory_to_use`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Excessive memory consumption: The vulnerability could lead to excessive memory usage due to the failure to limit memory allocation, potentially leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted JPEG image that leads to the `jpeg_mem_available()` function requesting more memory than the allowed limit. This is indicated by the description "possibly causing excessive memory consumption".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to submit a crafted JPEG image to an application using libjpeg-turbo.

**Summary of findings:**

The provided information indicates that CVE-2020-14152 is a vulnerability in `jpeg_mem_available()` within the libjpeg-turbo library that allows for excessive memory consumption by ignoring the `max_memory_to_use` setting, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.

The content from bugs.gentoo.org confirms that the fix is included in version 9d of the jpeg library. The content from lists.debian.org states that for Debian 9 stretch, this vulnerability has been fixed in version 1:1.5.1-2+deb9u1 of `libjpeg-turbo`.
