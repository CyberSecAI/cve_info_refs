- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Template injection vulnerability in Jira smart values using mustache partials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability stems from the ability to render files as mustache templates using user-controlled input within Jira smart values. This allows for the execution of arbitrary code or the reading of sensitive files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers could read and render files in the `WEB-INF/classes` and `<jira-installation>/jira/bin` directories by injecting malicious mustache templates. This could lead to information disclosure, code execution, or other attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the use of Jira smart values with mustache partials, where user-controlled input can be used to inject malicious template code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers must be able to interact with the vulnerable smart values, likely through Jira's user interface or API. They need to be able to insert malicious mustache templates to exploit the vulnerability.
