The provided content is related to CVE-2020-14942.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of Python's `pickle.loads` to deserialize data from the `saved_query.query` field without proper sanitization or validation in `tendenci\apps\helpdesk\views\staff.py`. The `saved_query.query` field contains base64 encoded pickled data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted Deserialization:** The application deserializes untrusted data using `pickle.loads` without any checks.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the pickled data before deserialization. This means an attacker can control the data being deserialized, which includes malicious Python objects.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can craft malicious pickled data that, when deserialized by the server, can lead to:
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting specially crafted payloads during the deserialization process, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker might be able to create a payload that causes the server to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to save a specially crafted `saved_query` with malicious pickled data in the `query` field through the `helpdesk_savequery` form.
- The attacker would then access the `ticket_list` view with the saved query ID via the `saved_query` GET parameter to trigger the deserialization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be a logged-in user able to save helpdesk queries.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious pickled data payload.
