Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14178:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an Information Disclosure issue in the `/browse.PROJECTKEY` endpoint of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The `/browse.PROJECTKEY` endpoint, in vulnerable versions, allows remote attackers to enumerate project keys. This means an attacker can determine the existence of projects within the Jira instance, which should be restricted to authorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Project Enumeration:** An attacker can discover valid project keys by accessing the `/browse.PROJECTKEY` endpoint, which is not intended to be publicly accessible.
- **Information Leakage:** This allows an attacker to gather information about the structure and organization of a Jira instance, potentially leading to further reconnaissance and exploitation attempts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending requests to the vulnerable `/browse.PROJECTKEY` endpoint.
- **Unauthenticated access:** It appears that no authentication is needed to trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Jira instance where the vulnerable endpoint is exposed.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
