## FAQ

### Q: Where can I find more info about this plugin?

A: The product’s page contains more information:

https://wordpress.dwbooster.com/forms/paypal-payment-pro-form

### Q: Where can I publish the PayPal Pro form with the PayPal button?

A: You can publish the PayPal contact forms / PayPal button into pages, posts and as a widget in the sidebar.

### Q: I’m not receiving the emails after PayPal payment.

A: Try first using a “from” email address that belongs to your website domain, this is the most common restriction applied in most hosting services.

If that doesn’t work please check if your hosting service requires some specific configuration to send emails from PHP/WordPress websites. The plugin uses the settings specified into the WordPress website to deliver the emails, if your hosting has some specific requirements like a fixed “from” address or a custom “SMTP” server those settings must be configured into the WordPress website.

### Q: Are the forms GDPR compliant?

A: In all plugin versions you can turn off IP tracking to avoid saving that user info. Full GDPR compliant forms can be built using the commercial versions of the plugin.

Quieren dar un “demo” pero no se puede hacer nada. ¿Cómo creen que vamos a comprar algo sin verlo? por otro lado, es muy feo el diseño, en ningún lugar se colocan las credenciales del sandbox de paypal así que también puede ser un fraude. Si toca colocar las credenciales en un tercero, habrá priblemas.

This plugin works just fine. Don’t listen to the negative reviews. I ended up purchasing the Pro version & It works great. The first transaction we ran posted into our paypal pro account without any hassle. Support was prompt to answer my questions. At first I almost didn’t purchase the plugin because of the negative reviews. Those 2 people don’t know what they are talking about. They were just upset they didn’t get all the cool stuff in the free version. That’s like getting a free car for your birthday & then complaining its not a Lamborghini. Some people just expect free hand outs in life & we all know that’s not how life works. Again, the plugin works great & support was prompt to respond. That’s really all you can ask for in a WordPress plugin. Good job on the plugin! 😀
