Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-14149:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `handle_CWD` function within `ftpcmd.c` of uftpd.
- When processing a `CWD` (Change Working Directory) command with an invalid path, the function could potentially lead to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** If `compose_abspath` or `compose_path` returns `NULL`, the `dir` variable becomes a NULL pointer. This NULL pointer is then used in a `DBG()` macro with a call to `strlen(dir)`, which attempts to dereference the NULL pointer, leading to a crash.
-   **Insufficient Input Validation/Error Handling:** The code lacks proper checks to prevent the `DBG` macro with `strlen()` from being called with a `NULL` `dir` pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The NULL pointer dereference causes the `uftpd` process to crash.
-   **Potential for Permanent DoS:** Depending on the init system or inetd setup used, the crash could be permanent, requiring manual intervention to restart the service.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network via the FTP protocol.
-   **Specifically Crafted CWD Command:** Sending an FTP `CWD` command with an invalid path (e.g., `CWD /../../../../../../../etc/passwd`) triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the FTP server.
-   **FTP Client:** The attacker needs an FTP client to send the malicious `CWD` command.
-   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered before authentication.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered because the debugging macro (`DBG()`) is invoked even when the log level is set to a lower level than `LOG_DEBUG`.
-   The fix involves ensuring that the `DBG()` macro is not called when the `dir` variable is NULL. This can be achieved by checking if `dir` is `NULL` before calling `strlen(dir)` within `DBG()`

This vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score of 7.5 (High), reflecting the potential for remote exploitation and high impact on availability.
