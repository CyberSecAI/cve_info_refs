{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Injection of an invalid field into a user's AddressSpace configuration within the user namespace.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The system does not properly validate user-supplied fields during configuration, allowing for the injection of unrecognized fields.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The injection of an invalid field puts AMQ Online in an inconsistent state, leading to the failure of AMQ Online components, such as the failure of provisioning and the failure of creating addresses for all users. This results in a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves injecting an invalid field into a user's address space configuration.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to modify user's address space configuration within the user namespace."
