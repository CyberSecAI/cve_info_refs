Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-14317:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a regression of a previously fixed security flaw (CVE-2019-3805) in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform - Continuous Delivery (EAP-CD).
- The regression reintroduces the vulnerability related to the manipulation of the PID file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability allows modification of the PID file located in `/var/run/jboss-eap/`.
- This PID file is used by the `init.d` script to manage the JBoss EAP process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can modify the PID file and cause the `init.d` script to terminate any process as root.
- This leads to a denial-of-service condition by terminating the targeted process which causes a loss of system availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves modifying the PID file. This implies an attacker would need write access to this file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would require write access to the `/var/run/jboss-eap/` directory to modify the PID file.

**Additional notes:**
- This vulnerability is a regression, meaning a fix for CVE-2019-3805 was not properly implemented or reintroduced in a later version of JBoss EAP-CD.
- The bug report indicates the issue was closed with a "WONTFIX" status, suggesting the vulnerability may not be directly fixed in the affected version. Any fixes would be through errata updates.
