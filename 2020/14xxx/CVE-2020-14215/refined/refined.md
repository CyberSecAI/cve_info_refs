Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14215:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A buggy database migration (`0198_preregistrationuser_invited_as`) in Zulip versions prior to 2.1.5 incorrectly assigned the administrator role to invitations, instead of the member role as intended.
*   Another bug allowed certain social authentication flows to use role data from expired invitations during signup.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Role Assignment:** The database migration failed to properly handle user roles for invitations, leading to the potential for normal users to be granted admin privileges.
*   **Use of Expired Invitation Data:** The system incorrectly used data from expired invitations, including the potentially corrupted role, during user signup.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Users who were initially invited as members could be incorrectly granted administrator privileges upon signup.
*   **Unauthorized Access/Control:** This could allow unauthorized users to gain administrative control of the Zulip server and its organization, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Social Authentication Flows:** The vulnerability was triggered when users signed up using social authentication methods, if an expired invitation existed for that email address.
*   **Expired Invitation:** An expired invitation with the corrupted administrator role data needed to exist for the email being used to sign up.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Existing Invitation:** The attacker's email address needed to have been previously invited to the Zulip organization (even if the invitation has expired).
*   **Use of Social Authentication:** The attacker needed to sign up using a social authentication method (e.g., Google).
*   **Vulnerable System:** The target Zulip server must be running a vulnerable version prior to 2.1.5, and originally installed using Zulip 1.9 or older, then upgraded to Zulip 2.0.0-rc1 or higher.

**Additional Details:**

*   The blog post mentions that the issue was rare, as invitations are usually accepted shortly after being sent.
*   The post also mentions that the Zulip team found 14 accounts on Zulip Cloud which were incorrectly created as administrators due to this bug.
*   The fix involves correcting the faulty migration, removing the administrator flag from existing invitation records, and preventing expired invitation data from being used in user creation.
*   Administrators are advised to check for unexpected administrators in their organization.
