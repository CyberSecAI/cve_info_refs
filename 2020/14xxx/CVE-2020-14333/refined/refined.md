Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14333:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the insufficient filtering of user-controllable parameters in the web interface of oVirt Engine. This lack of filtering allows for the injection of malicious code into the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where malicious scripts are injected through user input and reflected back to the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to launch phishing attacks, tricking users into revealing sensitive information.
- **Cookie Theft:** Malicious scripts can steal cookies, potentially allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users.
- **Impersonation:** By stealing user sessions, attackers can gain unauthorized access and perform actions on behalf of the compromised user within the application context.
- **Confidential Information Theft:**  Attackers can access other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of oVirt Engine. An attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes a payload within user-controllable parameters. The victim then needs to be lured into clicking the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or influence a URL with malicious code.
- The attacker needs to socially engineer a victim to click the malicious crafted link.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects oVirt Engine versions 4.4.2 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Chen RuiQi and Chen Huiliang from Qianxin CodeSafe Team.
- A patch was provided upstream.
- The vulnerability is addressed in Red Hat Virtualization Engine 4.4 via RHSA-2020:3807.
