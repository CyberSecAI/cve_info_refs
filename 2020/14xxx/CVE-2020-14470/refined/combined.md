## Description

In certain circumstances, downloading a package from the helm feed can leak the feed password to a deployment log. This means that an authenticated user could see a password that they would potentially not be authorized to view.

## Affected versions

**Octopus Server:** 2018.8.0 - 2019.12.1

## Mitigation

Not a lot of good options here:

* Upgrade to 2019.12.2+
* rotate feed passwords on a regular basis

## Workarounds

None known.
