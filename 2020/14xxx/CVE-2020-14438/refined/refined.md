The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability. This advisory provides detailed information about the vulnerability, its impact, affected products, and mitigation steps.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Pre-authentication command injection vulnerability

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability that can be exploited before authentication

**Impact of exploitation:**
  -  Allows attacker to execute commands on the affected device. This can potentially lead to complete compromise of the device, including unauthorized access to network resources, data theft, or denial of service. The advisory lists a CVSS v3 rating of 9.6 (Critical), with High impact on Confidentiality and Integrity, and Low impact on Availability

**Attack vectors:**
  - The vulnerability is present in the affected devices' firmware and can be exploited through network access. It is a pre-authentication vulnerability, so the attacker does not need to log in. The advisory lists the attack vector as "Adjacent"

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  -  Attacker must be within the adjacent network of the vulnerable device to exploit this vulnerability. This usually means they must be on the same WiFi network or LAN segment as the device. They don't need to log in to the device.

**Affected products:**
The following NETGEAR product models are affected:
*   RBK752, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBK753, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBK753S, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBR750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBS750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBK842, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBR840, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBS840, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBK852, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBK853, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBR850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
*   RBS850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
