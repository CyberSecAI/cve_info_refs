Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-14153:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds array read in the `jdhuff.c` file of the IJG JPEG library (libjpeg), specifically related to AC derived table pointers. This occurs during the start pass of the Huffman decoding process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The code attempts to access an array (specifically `ac_derived_tbls`) using an index that may be outside of the valid bounds of the array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a potential crash or denial of service due to the out-of-bounds memory access. It could also potentially lead to other undefined behavior depending on the context and the specific memory location being accessed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious JPEG image that triggers the vulnerable code path in `jdhuff.c`. Specifically, the crafted image must have certain characteristics in its Huffman table data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted JPEG file to a vulnerable system or application that utilizes the vulnerable version of libjpeg.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects IJG JPEG (aka libjpeg) versions 8 through 9c.
- The fix involves a change in how AC table pointers are handled in the start pass of Huffman decoding (`jdhuff.c`). In the vulnerable code, the ac_cur_tbls[blkn] was directly assigned `entropy->ac_derived_tbls[compptr->ac_tbl_no]`. The fix introduces a check `cinfo->lim_Se` to see if an AC table should be used. If not the `ac_cur_tbls[blkn]` is set to NULL.
- The libjpeg-turbo project reported that the vulnerable code is not present and the problematic condition cannot be reached in their code base.
