Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-14380:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Red Hat Satellite handles external authentication (SSO or OpenID Connect) in conjunction with local user accounts. Specifically, the auto-creation of users on login, when enabled, allows an authenticated attacker to impersonate an existing local user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper User Authentication Handling:** The system incorrectly associates external authentication with existing local users during the auto-creation process.
- **Lack of Authentication Differentiation:** The system fails to differentiate between external and local authentication, leading to potential user impersonation.
- **Auto-creation of users on login:** When enabled, this feature allows for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** An attacker can gain full control of existing local user accounts within Red Hat Satellite.
- **Confidentiality Breach:**  Attackers can potentially access sensitive information.
- **Integrity Violation:**  Attackers can modify system configurations or data.
- **System Availability Disruption:** Attackers can potentially disrupt the normal operation of the Satellite server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated SSO user can escalate their privileges to that of an existing local user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **External Authentication:** The attack leverages the external authentication mechanisms (SSO or OpenID Connect) configured in Red Hat Satellite.
- **Auto-creation Feature:** The vulnerability requires that the auto-creation of users on login is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid SSO Authentication:** The attacker must have a valid account on the configured external authentication source (SSO or OpenID Connect).
- **Target System:** The attacker targets a Red Hat Satellite system where the auto-creation of users on login is enabled, and has configured external authentication via SSO or OpenID Connect.
- **Knowledge of Existing Local Users:** The attacker must know the existence of local users, although the bug report does not specifically state they need to know the local username.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in Red Hat Satellite 6.7.2 and later versions.
- A hotfix was available for Satellite 6.7.2 and 6.7.3.
- The issue is resolved in RHSA-2020:4366 which is available for Red Hat Satellite 6.7 for RHEL 8.
- A mitigation is to disable the external login if the Satellite user has their authentication set to INTERNAL, or disable auto-creation of users on login.
