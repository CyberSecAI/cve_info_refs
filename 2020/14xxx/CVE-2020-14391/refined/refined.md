Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-14391:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the GNOME Control Center improperly handling Red Hat Customer Portal credentials when a user registers a system through the GNOME Settings user interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Password Exposure:** The Red Hat Customer Portal password is passed as a command-line argument to the `gnome-settings-daemon` helper.
- **Logging:** The command, including the password, is logged on the system, making it potentially readable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** A local attacker can potentially discover the Red Hat Customer Portal password.
-  **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** While not a direct privilege escalation, a local unprivileged user can gain access to an administrative account's Red Hat Customer Portal credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
- **Log Access or Process Monitoring:** The attacker needs to be able to read system logs or monitor running processes to see the command being executed with the password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** An unprivileged local user on the system.
- **Access to Logs or Process Monitoring Tools:** The attacker needs to be able to access system logs or utilize tools to monitor processes.

**Additional Information:**
- The likelihood of exploitation is considered low because system registration usually occurs during installation before untrusted users have access.
- The vulnerability does not affect `gnome-settings-daemon` versions shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, as they do not include the subscription-manager plugin.
- Mitigation includes using `subscription-manager` directly from the terminal without the `--password` flag.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 8.2 Extended Update Support.
