Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-14982

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection (SQLI) issue.
*   It occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `sortBy` parameter of the `com.threeis.webta.H352premPayRequest` servlet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the `sortBy` parameter, which is then executed against the backend database. The "blind" aspect implies that the attacker does not directly see the results of their queries. Instead, they infer results by observing the application's behavior (e.g., by causing the server to make an external HTTP request using the `UTL_HTTP.REQUEST` function).
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize the input provided in the `sortBy` parameter, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Attackers can read sensitive data from the database. The specific data mentioned includes usernames, passwords, Social Security Numbers (SSNs), names, and addresses.
*   **Potential Database Manipulation:** Although not explicitly detailed, SQL injection can also lead to data modification, deletion, or even taking control of the database server. The content mentions that SQLi can be used to "modify DB data, execute admin operations on the database (such as shutting down the DBMS), recover files on the DBMS file system and, in some cases, issues commands on the DB server."
*   **Arbitrary HTTP Requests:** The attacker can force the server to make arbitrary HTTP requests to external servers, which can be used to confirm the injection and gain additional information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request Manipulation:** An attacker modifies the `sortBy` parameter in a POST request to the vulnerable servlet.
*   **SQL Injection Payload:** The malicious SQL code is embedded within the manipulated `sortBy` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Application Access:** The attacker needs to have an account with at least Employee, Supervisor, or Timekeeper role. This is necessary to access the vulnerable functionality within the WebTA application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs some understanding of SQL syntax to craft the malicious queries.
*   **Web Request Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify web requests (e.g., using a proxy like Burp Suite).

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Kronos WebTA versions 3.8.x and older 3.x versions before 4.0.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by MindPoint Group during a penetration testing engagement.
*   A patch was released by the vendor on 02/24/2020
*   The vulnerability was found in the `com.threeis.webta.H352premPayRequest` servlet.
*   The exploit requires the attacker to first submit a leave request in order to make the vulnerable sorting functionality available.
