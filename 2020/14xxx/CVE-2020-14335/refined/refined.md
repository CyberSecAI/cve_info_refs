Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-14335:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that the OMAPI (Object Management API) secret for the ISC DHCP server in Red Hat Satellite's Smart-Proxy is world-readable. By default, the ISC DHCP server listens on all interfaces for OMAPI interaction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **World-readable OMAPI secret:** The OMAPI secret, which is meant to be private, is accessible to any local user of the Smart-Proxy system.
- **Default listening on all interfaces:** The ISC DHCP server listens on all interfaces for OMAPI interactions by default, making the secret more easily accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Control of DHCP records:** An attacker who can read the OMAPI secret can gain control of DHCP records on the network.
- **System availability:** The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability, as the attacker can manipulate network configurations via DHCP.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** A local user on the Smart-Proxy system is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **ISC DHCP Server:** Exploitation occurs through the ISC DHCP server by interacting with its OMAPI interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the Smart-Proxy system where the ISC DHCP server is running.
- The attacker needs to have the capability to interact with the ISC DHCP server's OMAPI interface.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Satellite 6.8 for RHEL 7 via RHSA-2021:1313.
- The bug report mentions that no readily available mitigation met Red Hat's criteria for ease of use, deployment, and stability at the time of discovery.
- The vulnerability was reported by Peter Bray (illumino Pty Ltd, Australia).
