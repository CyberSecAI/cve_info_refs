{
  "CVE-2020-14015": {
    "Root cause": "The forgot password feature does not require a valid activation code to reset a user's password. Newly created users do not have an activation code set, allowing an attacker to reset the password of the first user without an activation key.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure password reset mechanism",
       "Missing validation of activation code"
    ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can reset the password of the first created user, effectively taking over the user's account.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a password reset request without an activation code.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs access to the forgot password functionality and an active user account in the system."
  }
