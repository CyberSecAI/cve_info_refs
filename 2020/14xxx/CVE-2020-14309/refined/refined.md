Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-14309:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in the `grub_squash_read_symlink` function within Grub2. This occurs when handling a symbolic link in a squashfs filesystem where the name's length is equal to `UINT32_MAX` bytes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The code fails to validate the size of the symbolic link name before allocating memory for it. Specifically, an attacker-controlled size of `UINT32_MAX` leads to a zero-sized allocation due to an arithmetic overflow.
*   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:**  Following the zero-sized memory allocation, attacker-controlled data is written into this undersized buffer, causing a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Confidentiality and Integrity:** The vulnerability can allow an attacker to overwrite memory, potentially leading to information disclosure and data corruption.
*   **System Availability:** The memory corruption can lead to system instability and a denial-of-service.
*   **Secure Boot Bypass:** Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to load an untrusted kernel, thus bypassing Secure Boot protections.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:**  Attack requires local access (physical access or root access on a networked system).
*   **Crafted Squashfs Filesystem:** The attacker must create a specially crafted squashfs filesystem containing a symbolic link with a name length of `UINT32_MAX` bytes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access**: The attacker needs to have a high privilege position, such as having either direct physical access to the system or root-level access to a networked system.
*   **Ability to alter the boot process**:  The attacker must be able to modify the boot process, possibly through gaining the ability to alter a pxe-boot network, or have root access to a networked system.
*   **Crafting Malicious Input:** The attacker needs the capability to create the malicious squashfs image with the specific symbolic link to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details (from Red Hat Bugzilla):**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when the code reads a symbolic link with a name length of UINT32 bytes.
*   The overflow leads to a zero-sized allocation.
*   The subsequent write to this zero-sized allocation causes a heap buffer overflow.
*   The fix involves preventing the arithmetic overflow by properly handling cases with sizes that are equal to or greater than `UINT32_MAX`.

**Affected Products (from NetApp advisory and Suse advisory):**

*   NetApp Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere
*   HPE Helion OpenStack 8
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise products, including SLES, SLED, SLES for SAP, and SLES for HPC (versions prior to those listed in the advisories)
*   openSUSE Leap 15.1 and 15.2
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise Micro versions 5.0 to 5.4
*   SUSE OpenStack Cloud 7,8, and 9

**Remediation (from NetApp, Suse, and Red Hat advisories):**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by updating Grub2 to version 2.06 or later.
*   Patches have been released for affected products and can be installed through normal update procedures.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-14309 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Grub2 resulting from an integer overflow when handling a specially crafted symbolic link with a name of size `UINT32_MAX` in squashfs filesystems. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution during the boot process, enabling Secure Boot bypass. The vulnerability requires high-privilege local access and is addressed by updating Grub2.

It should be noted that the SUSE and Red Hat reports are more detailed than the NetApp one and are the primary source of the more in-depth technical information provided.
