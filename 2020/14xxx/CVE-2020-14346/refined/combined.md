memory. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-14347](/security/CVE-2020-14347))

Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled the

XkbSelectEvents function. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

escalate privileges. ([CVE-2020-14361](/security/CVE-2020-14361))

Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled the

XRecordRegisterClients function. A local attacker could possibly use this

issue to escalate privileges. ([CVE-2020-14362](/security/CVE-2020-14362))

Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled the

XkbSetNames function. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

# Advisory Details

December 9th, 2020
## X.Org Server XIChangeHierarchy Integer Underflow Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-20-1417ZDI-CAN-11429

| CVE ID | [CVE-2020-14346](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-14346) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [X.Org](https://www.x.org/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Server |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of X.Org Server. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of XIChangeHierarchy requests. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer underflow before writing to memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of root. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | X.Org has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2020-07-24 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2020-12-09 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
