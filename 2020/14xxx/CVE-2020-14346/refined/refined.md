Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-14346:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an integer underflow within the handler for the `XIChangeHierarchy` request in X.Org X Server. This occurs because of a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Underflow:** The primary vulnerability is an integer underflow. This occurs when a calculation results in a value smaller than the minimum value the data type can hold, causing the value to wrap around to a large positive number. This can lead to memory corruption or other unexpected behavior.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The root cause is insufficient validation of user-supplied data within the `XIChangeHierarchy` request handler. This allows an attacker to manipulate input in a way that triggers the integer underflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges and execute code in the context of the root user. This means a low-privileged user can gain full control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the vulnerable system, meaning the attacker must have the ability to execute code on the machine where the X server is running. This can be achieved via a compromised account or other means.
*   **XIChangeHierarchy Request:** The attacker must send a specifically crafted `XIChangeHierarchy` request to the X server to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to have a user account with the ability to execute code on the target system. This includes being able to communicate with the X server.
*   **Crafted Input:** The attacker needs to craft a specific `XIChangeHierarchy` request that causes the integer underflow, which requires knowledge of the vulnerability details.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jan-Niklas Sohn from Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
*   Patches for the issue have been committed to the X.Org server Git repository and included in version 1.20.9 and later.
*   The vulnerability is present in X.Org X Server versions prior to 1.20.10 according to Gentoo.
*   Red Hat states that Xorg server does not run with root privileges in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, therefore the impact is moderate on that version.
*   Ubuntu assigned this CVE a USN (Ubuntu Security Notice) of USN-4488-2 and provided updated packages.
