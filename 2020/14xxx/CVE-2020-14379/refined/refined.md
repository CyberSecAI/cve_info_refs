Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-14379

**Description:** The vulnerability is an XXE (XML External Entity) injection flaw found in the configuration files of the Red Hat AMQ broker.

**Root Cause:** The AMQ broker parses XML configuration files without proper sanitization of external entities, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML code.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **XXE Injection:** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious XML code through external entities. This can lead to several impacts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious XML configuration file can cause the broker to fail, leading to a loss of availability for the service. This can have a wide impact, as data durability, load balancing, and broker clustering are common features of the broker system.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially exfiltrate sensitive data by leveraging the XXE injection to access files on the system. However, the scope of exfiltrated files is limited to those accessible under the same privileges as the JVM running the broker, files that are not "special" files, and files that do not contain special characters/newlines (depending on how the vulnerability is triggered).
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  The vulnerability may allow SSRF attacks via XXE if there are other accessible unauthenticated services.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Configuration File Modification:**  The primary attack vector involves modifying the AMQ broker's configuration files to inject malicious XML.
*   **Local Access:** The configuration files are usually accessed locally. Although the AMQ broker is tied to the network, the attack requires altering the local files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs to have privileges equal to or higher than the AMQ broker process to modify the configuration files. This typically requires administrative or significant privileges on the system.
*   **Local System Access:** The attacker must have access to the local file system where the configuration files are stored.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any user interaction. The vulnerability is triggered once the AMQ broker reads the modified configuration file.

**Additional Details**
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry (Bug 1840862) directly references CVE-2020-14379.
*   The Bugzilla entry notes that the confidentiality impact is considered low due to the limited scope of file exfiltration but availability is high due to the DoS potential.
*   The Exploitability Metrics are: Attack Vector Local (AV:L), Attack Complexity Low (AC:L), Privileges Required High (PR:H), User Interaction None (UI:N), and Scope Unchanged (S:U).
