Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-14944:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper authorization controls in multiple API endpoints of the BSA Radar application. This allows authenticated users to perform actions on other users' accounts without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)/Authorization Bypass**: The application fails to verify if a user has the authority to modify or access another user's data by UserID.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The `SaveUserProfile` endpoint is vulnerable to stored XSS through the `Firstname` and `Lastname` parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Takeover**: An attacker can change another user's password using the `ChangePassword` endpoint, leading to account takeover.
*   **Account Modification**: An attacker can modify user profile details, including first name, last name, email, and phone number, using the `SaveUserProfile` endpoint.
*   **Stored XSS**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into user profiles, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to attacker-controlled websites.
*   **Information Disclosure**: An attacker can enumerate and view user account details, including full name, username, user permissions, account role, email, and password question, via the `GetUser` endpoint.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the exposed API endpoints:
*   `ChangePassword`: Allows modification of another user's password.
*   `SaveUserProfile`: Allows modification of another user's profile details and injection of XSS payloads.
*   `GetUser`: Allows retrieval of another user's account information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the BSA Radar application.
*   **Knowledge of UserIDs**: The attacker needs to know or be able to enumerate valid UserIDs to target specific accounts.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests**: The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable API endpoints.
