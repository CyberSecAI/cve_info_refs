The provided content is related to CVE-2020-14063.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the `TCCJ_Core_Content::update` function running immediately upon plugin startup, before WordPress access control functions such as capability checks and nonce verification could be used. This, combined with the lack of capability checks and nonce verification within the function itself, allowed unauthorized users to call it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Lack of access controls
- Missing nonce verification
- Function execution before WordPress access control checks

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings via a POST request. This code would be executed in the footer of every page on the site when displayed by `TCCJ_Core_Frontend::print_script_in_footer`. This could lead to:
- Redirection of visitors to malicious sites
- Stealing of payment information
- Infection of files with backdoors
- Creation of malicious administrator accounts leading to full site takeover

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a POST request to any location on a vulnerable site with `tccj-update` parameter set to `Update` and `tccj-content` parameter set to malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated attacker is required, with no specific position.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in TC Custom JavaScript plugin versions prior to 1.2.2.
- While the `update` function used `htmlentities`, the `print_script_in_footer` function decoded those entities and wrapped the content in `<script>` tags, negating the sanitization efforts.
- The plugin was fixed in version 1.2.2 which was released on June 29, 2020.
