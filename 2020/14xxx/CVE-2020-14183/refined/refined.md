Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an information disclosure in the HTTP response headers of affected Jira Server and Data Center versions. Specifically, the Support Entitlement Number (SEN) is exposed via these headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the SEN through HTTP response headers. This leaks sensitive information about the Jira instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers with limited (non-admin) privileges can obtain the SEN. While the direct impact of leaking the SEN is not detailed, it can be considered sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Response Headers:** The vulnerability is exploited by examining the HTTP response headers.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this remotely, given they have access to make requests to the vulnerable Jira instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Limited (Non-Admin) Privileges:** The attacker doesn't need administrative privileges; a basic level of access to the Jira instance is sufficient.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Jira instance.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The issue is classified as a "Bug" with a "Low" priority.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in versions 7.13.18, 8.5.9, 8.12.1, 8.13.0, and 8.14.0.
