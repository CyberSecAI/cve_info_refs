Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-14312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an insecure default configuration in `dnsmasq` as shipped with Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Specifically, `dnsmasq` is configured to listen on all interfaces and accept queries from any address, including those outside the local subnet. The `local-service` option, which restricts queries to the local subnet, is not enabled by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Resolver:** The primary vulnerability is that `dnsmasq`, in its default state, acts as an open resolver. An open resolver is a DNS server that accepts queries from any source, rather than just from a specific or trusted network.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The missing `local-service` option allows unrestricted access to the DNS resolver, making it accessible from the internet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks:** The primary impact is that an attacker can leverage the open resolver to conduct DDoS attacks against other systems. By sending DNS queries to the vulnerable `dnsmasq` server with a spoofed source IP address of the target, the DNS server will then send a large volume of replies to the spoofed address, overwhelming the target with traffic.
*   **Involvement in Malicious Activity:** Systems running `dnsmasq` with the default configuration may be inadvertently used in DDoS attacks without the owner's knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Queries:** Attackers can send DNS queries from anywhere on the internet to the vulnerable `dnsmasq` server.
*   **Spoofed Source IP:** Attackers can spoof the source IP address in their DNS queries, causing `dnsmasq` to send its responses to a different target address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Internet Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the internet to send queries to the exposed `dnsmasq` server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Instance:** The attacker needs to know the IP address of a system running `dnsmasq` with the insecure default configuration.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability can be mitigated by adding the `local-service` option to the `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` file, or a file in `/etc/dnsmasq.d`. Additionally, a firewall can provide another layer of protection.

**Additional details:**
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and Fedora have firewalld service enabled by default, which blocks incoming DNS queries, which mitigates this issue by default.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in `dnsmasq-2.81-4.fc32` and `dnsmasq-2.80-16.fc31`.
