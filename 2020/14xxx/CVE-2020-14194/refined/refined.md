- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of protection against reverse tabnapping in topic header links.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reverse tabnapping. This occurs when a malicious website is linked from a vulnerable page, and when the user clicks the link, the malicious website can then manipulate the original page via the `window.opener` object.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially modify the original Zulip page, potentially redirecting the user to a phishing site, or performing other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to craft a malicious link within a Zulip topic header and convince a user to click it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a topic header link. They also need a malicious website to redirect the user to once the user clicks the crafted link.
