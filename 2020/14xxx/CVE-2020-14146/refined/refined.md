{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The application allows the injection of arbitrary malicious HTML or JavaScript code into a user's web browser.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the path parameters, specifically when accessing the `pages/kumbia/<payload>` route. The payload is not properly sanitized before being included in the HTML response.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and convince a user to visit the URL. The application must be in `Development` mode for the full stack trace with the unsanitized injection to be shown."
