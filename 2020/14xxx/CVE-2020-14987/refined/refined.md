Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the identified vulnerability related to CVE-2020-14987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the ability to execute arbitrary code through the updater editor functionality within the Bloomreach Experience Manager (brXM). Specifically, this is achieved by using a Groovy AST transformation to bypass restrictions on system commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is RCE, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The updater editor does not properly sanitize input, allowing the injection of malicious Groovy code with AST transformations.
*   **Bypassed Security Measures:** Restrictions on system commands within the updater are bypassed using a known Groovy technique.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to complete control of the server.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** The attacker can access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **Malware Installation:** The attacker could install malware, backdoors, or other malicious software on the system.
*   **Lateral Movement:** If the vulnerable server is part of a larger network, the attacker can use it as a pivot to gain access to other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Updater Editor:** The vulnerability is exploited through the brXM updater editor.
*   **Groovy AST Transformation:** The vulnerability leverages the ability to inject a malicious AST transformation to execute arbitrary commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrator Privileges:** Access to the updater editor requires administrator-level privileges, making the vulnerability directly exploitable to administrator users or, if chained with CSRF, through a less privileged account.
*   **Knowledge of Groovy AST Transformation Bypass:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific Groovy technique used to bypass restrictions on system commands.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor acknowledges the vulnerability but has not fixed it.
*   The vendor recommends limiting access to the updater editor to a minimal set of trusted administrators as mitigation.
* The provided content also describes multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities, but these are not related to CVE-2020-14987.
* The provided content gives greater details on the RCE than the CVE description.
