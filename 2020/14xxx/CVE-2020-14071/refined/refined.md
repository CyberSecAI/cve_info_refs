Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14071:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input within both admin and client scripts. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which is then executed by the victim's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple endpoints in both the admin and client sections of the MK-Auth system fail to sanitize user-controlled inputs. These unsanitized inputs are directly included in the responses sent to users, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- **Information Disclosure:** Through XSS, attackers could potentially access sensitive information such as session cookies, potentially leading to account hijacking and data breaches.
- **Malicious Actions:**  XSS can be leveraged to perform various malicious actions such as defacing web pages, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The attack is executed by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to vulnerable endpoints. The request includes malicious JavaScript code within the parameters, which the vulnerable application reflects back without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, without needing any physical access to the vulnerable server or system. They only need to send crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
