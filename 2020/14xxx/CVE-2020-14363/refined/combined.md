The integer overflow is a necessary precursor to the double free.
The integer overflow occurs in this for loop, as length can be incremented to a negative value with sufficiently large font set names. https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/blob/master/modules/om/generic/omGeneric.c#L2010
Because length is a signed int, it wraps, which then causes the call to malloc() to fail here: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/blob/master/modules/om/generic/omGeneric.c#L2025
Which leads to Xfree(required\_list)https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/blob/master/modules/om/generic/omGeneric.c#L2027
Note that required\_list and om->core.required\_charset.charset\_list are equivalent.  https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/blob/master/modules/om/generic/omGeneric.c#L2018
Now because init\_om returned false, we "goto err" here: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/blob/master/modules/om/generic/omGeneric.c#L2071
Then in close\_om() we call Xfree for a second time on the same region of memory: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11/-/blob/master/modules/om/generic/omGeneric.c#L1678
So now the same object is freed twice, once as required\_list, and a second time as om->core.required\_charset.charset\_list.
To generate the locale here is a small shell script (which requires plenty of RAM and a bit of patience, so don't run it unless you absolutely need to verify the realisability of the vulnerability). https://github.com/Ruia-ruia/Exploits/blob/master/x11doublefree.shThe PoC generates enough fontsets, with large enough names, to increment the length variable in init\_om to a negative value. I have tested on Ubuntu 20.04, with Glibc 2.31 installed. To trigger the vulnerability, simply run the script and call XOpenOM() in your own application.

Double free in libX11 locale handling code
==========================================

CVE-2020-14363

There is an integer overflow and a double free vulnerability in the way
LibX11 handles locales. The integer overflow is a necessary precursor to
the double free.

Patches
-------

A Patch for this issue has been committed to the libX11 git repository.
libX11 1.6.12 will be released shortly and will include this patch.

<https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libx11>

commit acdaaadcb3d85c61fd43669fc5dddf0f8c3f911d (HEAD -> master)

    Fix an integer overflow in init_om()

    CVE-2020-14363

    This can lead to a double free later, as reported by Jayden Rivers.

Thanks
------

X.Org thanks Jayden Rivers for reporting this issue to our security
team and assisting them in understanding them and providing fixes.
