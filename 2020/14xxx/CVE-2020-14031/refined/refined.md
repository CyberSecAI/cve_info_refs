{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The 'outbox' functionality of the TXT module in Ozeki SMS Gateway allows specifying a directory for storing outgoing messages. However, it processes all files within the specified directory as if they were messages to be sent, resulting in deletion of these files",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary File Deletion vulnerability due to improper handling of file paths and lack of validation within the TXT module's 'outbox' functionality.",
      "The application runs with 'NT Authority\\System' privileges, allowing it to delete a wide range of files."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with access to the Ozeki SMS Gateway web interface can delete arbitrary files from the server, leading to various impacts depending on the target folder: OS level Denial of Service by deleting system files, loss of user configurations by deleting config files,  and general data loss by deleting user files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker with administrative privileges on the Ozeki SMS Gateway web application can modify the TXT module's 'outbox' path to point to a target directory, triggering the deletion process."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs access to the Ozeki Web Application administration interface with rights to create/modify the 'outbox' location of a 'TXT' Module. This could be an authenticated user with sufficient privileges or an attacker who has compromised these credentials."
