{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the dbih_setup_handle function of perl-DBI when handling an overlong DBD class name.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause an out-of-bounds write by supplying a string longer than 300 characters, potentially leading to memory corruption, affecting the availability of the service, and/or compromising data integrity. In some cases it could also lead to code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local attacker is able to supply a string longer than 300 characters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access and the ability to supply a long string as a DBD class name, which is passed to the vulnerable function."
