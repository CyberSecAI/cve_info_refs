{
  "CVE-2020-14392": {
    "Description": "An untrusted pointer dereference flaw was found in Perl-DBI < 1.643. A local attacker who is able to manipulate calls to dbd_db_login6_sv() could cause memory corruption, affecting the service's availability.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from an untrusted pointer dereference within the `dbd_db_login6_sv()` function of the Perl DBI module. Specifically, when the Perl stack is reallocated, a pointer returned by the ST(*) macro can become invalid, leading to memory corruption when dereferenced.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Untrusted pointer dereference",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "The memory corruption can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) by affecting the availability of the service.  It could potentially be used to execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker needs to manipulate calls to the vulnerable function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access is required. The attacker must have the ability to manipulate calls to the `dbd_db_login6_sv()` function.  No user interaction is required."
