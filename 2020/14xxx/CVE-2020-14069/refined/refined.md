The provided content includes information about multiple vulnerabilities in MK-Auth version 19.01, including CVE-2020-14069.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2020-14069 is a lack of proper input sanitization, resulting in SQL injection vulnerabilities in multiple PHP scripts within the `/mkt/` directory. Specifically, user-controlled data is directly appended into SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The vulnerability lies in the direct inclusion of user-supplied data into SQL queries, making them susceptible to SQL injection attacks. Vulnerable files include `mkt/arp.php`, `mkt/dhcp.php`, `mkt/hotspot.php`, `mkt/ip.php`, `mkt/pgaviso.php`, `mkt/pgcorte.php`, `mkt/pppoe.php`, `mkt/queues.php`, and `mkt/wifi.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the database to cause a denial of service.
*  **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data stored in the database could be disclosed to unauthorized parties.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP request, which injects malicious SQL code into the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected endpoints. They do not need any prior authentication or specific privileges.
