- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Pre-authentication command injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability that can be exploited before authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a compromise of the affected system. The CVSS score indicates a critical severity with high impact on confidentiality and integrity, and a low impact on availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning an attacker needs to be within the same network segment as the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction. They need to be on the same local network segment as the affected device.
