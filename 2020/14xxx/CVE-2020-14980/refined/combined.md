# Sophos Secure Email Android Application - MITM SSL Certificate Vulnerability (CVE-2020-14980)

## Overview

"Sophos Secure Email is a containerized and secure email app that lets you fully separate enterprise and private data on your device. It handles the corporate emails, contacts and calendar from the company’s Exchange server. Corporate data is protected with AES-256 encryption and the export of data is controlled by the company’s Data Loss Prevention (DLP) rules."

## Issue

The Sophos Secure Email Android application (version 3.9.4 and below, later versions have not been tested), does not validate the SSL certificate it receives when connecting to the application server.
## Impact

An attacker who can perform a man in the middle attack may present a bogus SSL certificate which the application will accept silently.
Sensitive information could be captured by an attacker without the user's knowledge.
