- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Sophos Secure Email Android application does not properly validate the SSL certificate when connecting to the application server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack due to the lack of SSL certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker performing a MITM attack can present a bogus SSL certificate that the application will silently accept, enabling them to capture sensitive information transmitted by the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the application and the server to perform the MITM attack.
