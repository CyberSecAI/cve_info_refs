Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-14520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to missing authorization in the Inductive Automation Ignition 8 software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization (CWE-862):** An unprotected API endpoint allows access without requiring any authentication.
- **Information Leak:** The lack of authorization allows an attacker to send an HTTP request to the unprotected API endpoint and potentially determine if an arbitrary file path exists on the filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Access:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information by determining the existence of files on the filesystem.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** Exploitation can occur remotely over the network.
- **HTTP Request:** The attack involves sending an HTTP request to the unprotected API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
- **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials or prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Low Skill Level:** The exploit is considered to have a low skill level, suggesting it is relatively easy to perform.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Products:** Inductive Automation Ignition 8 versions prior to 8.0.13
- **CVSS Score:** 7.5 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
- **Mitigation:** Upgrade to Ignition 8.0.13, minimize network exposure of control systems, locate control systems behind firewalls, and use secure remote access methods like VPNs.
- The vulnerability was reported by Mashav Sapir of Claroty to CISA.
