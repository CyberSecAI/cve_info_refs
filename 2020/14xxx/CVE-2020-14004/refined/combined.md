### Breaking Changes

* Remove CheckResultReader (which has been deprecated since v2.9). [#9714](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9714)
* Remove StatusDataWriter (which has been deprecated since v2.9). [#9715](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9715)
* ElasticsearchWriter: drop support for Elasticsearch < v7. [#9812](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9812)
* Consider a checkable unreachable once one Dependency fails.

  Previously all of them had to fail. (Consult the upgrading docs.) [#8218](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/8218)
* API: reject config modifications during reload with HTTP status 503. [#9445](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9445)
* `icinga2 daemon`: to reduce config load time, write file needed by

  `icinga2 object list` only if `--dump-objects` is given. [#9586](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9586) [#9591](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9591)
* Default email notification scripts: link to Icinga DB Web,

  not the monitoring module. (Consult the upgrading docs.) [#9742](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9742) [#9757](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9757)
* API: for security reasons hide TicketSalt in /v1/variables. [#7863](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/7863)

#### Icinga 2 Config DSL

* Disallow global variable modification after config commit start (i.e.

  inside `object/apply T "x" { ... }`) to reduce config load time. [#9740](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9740)
* Forbid Dependency cycles at config load time. [#8389](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/8389)
* Allow only strings in the arrays Host#groups, Service#groups and

  User#groups. Needed for consistency, especially by the IDO. [#9057](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9057)
* Disallow empty object names. (They worked only partially anyway.) [#9409](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9409)

#### Windows Agent only

The official MSIs don't include the following features anymore.

They weren't intended, tested or needed on Windows and only waste build time,

bandwidth and disk space. Both new installations and upgrades are affected.

* ElasticsearchWriter [#9704](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9704)
* GelfWriter [#9704](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9704)
* GraphiteWriter [#9704](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9704)
* InfluxdbWriter and Influxdb2Writer [#9704](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9704)
* OpenTsdbWriter [#9704](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9704)
* PerfdataWriter [#9704](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9704)

We also don't ship the following files anymore.

(You can still obtain them manually.)

* `NSCP.msi` (NSClient++ installer) [#9703](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9703)
* [doc/](/Icinga/icinga2/blob/v2.14.0/doc) (Icinga 2 markdown documentation) [#9705](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9705)

On the other hand MSIs are now 75% smaller than before.

### Enhancements

* Significantly reduce config load time of large setups.

  Windows REST API. (Doesn't spawn a PowerShell process for that.) [#9062](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9062)
* JournaldLogger which logs to systemd journal. [#9000](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9000)

* Default mail notification scripts: also print `$host.notes$` and `$service.notes$`. [#9713](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9713)
* Enable built-in OpenSSL DH parameters to allow DHE TLS ciphers. [#9811](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9811)
* Clean up global default TLS cipher list to improve security. [#9809](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9809)
* Influxdb(2)Writer: write more precise timestamps (nanoseconds). [#9599](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/9599)

Subject: icinga2: CVE-2020-14004: prepare-dirs script allows for symlink
 attack in the icinga user context

Hello list,

during the review of directories with special permissions in openSUSE
distributions I noticed an icinga user privilege escalation issue in the
icinga2 monitoring software [1].

# Issue Description

The icinga2 systemd service in /usr/lib/systemd/system/icinga2.service
contains the following Start statements:

```
ExecStartPre=/usr/lib/icinga2/prepare-dirs /etc/sysconfig/icinga2
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/icinga2 daemon --close-stdio -e ${ICINGA2_ERROR_LOG}
```

The prepare-dirs bash script which is executed as root contains - among
other things - the following sequence of commands:

```
if [ ! -e "$ICINGA2_INIT_RUN_DIR" ]; then
        mkdir "$ICINGA2_INIT_RUN_DIR"
        mkdir "$ICINGA2_INIT_RUN_DIR"/cmd
fi

chmod 755 "$ICINGA2_INIT_RUN_DIR"
chmod 2750 "$ICINGA2_INIT_RUN_DIR"/cmd
chown -R $ICINGA2_USER:$ICINGA2_COMMAND_GROUP "$ICINGA2_INIT_RUN_DIR"
```

It is made sure that the /run/icinga2 and /run/icinga2/cmd directories
are existing. Then /run/icinga2/cmd is given a setgid bit. And then
/run/icinga2 is recursively chowned to icinga:icingacmd.

The `chmod 2750 "$ICINGA2_INIT_RUN_DIR"/cmd` line allows the
unprivileged icinga user to perform a symlink attack, if /run/icinga2
already existed before which can for example happen when the icinga2
service is restarted.

Proof of concept on openSUSE Tumbleweed:

```
root# zypper in --no-recommends icinga2
[...]
root# systemctl start icinga2

# simulate a compromised icinga user account
root# sudo -u icinga /bin/bash
icinga# cd /run/icinga2
icinga# rm -rf cmd
# replace the cmd directory by a symlink to a privileged path
icinga# ln -s /usr/bin/bash cmd
# back to root
icinga# exit

# trigger prepare-dirs to be run again
root# sytemctl restart icinga2
# /usr/bin/bash is now of mode 2750
root# ls -lh /usr/bin/bash
-rwxr-s--- 1 root root 1.2M 19. Mai 15:05 /usr/bin/bash
```

This is no full local root exploit as far as I can see. It's lucky
because the mode 02750 doesn't allow `other` to execute the file.
Otherwise it would allow the attacker to gain e.g. root group
permissions. But the attack still allows a denial-of-service by denying
non-root users access to vital system directories. Maybe it could also
be combined with other security issues to gain full root privileges.

Upstream addressed this via commit 2f0f2e8c355b75fa4407d23f85feea037d2bc4b6
[3]. This fix removes the `chmod` lines and uses `mkdir -m <mode>` instead.

My personal long-term suggestion is to replace this directory creation logic
by a systemd-tmpfiles configuration file.

# Remaining aspects

Apart from the `chmod` issue there is still the recursive chown line
`chown -R $ICINGA2_USER:$ICINGA2_COMMAND_GROUP "$ICINGA2_INIT_RUN_DIR"`
left in the script. This is also not ideal. `chown` from GNU coreutils
is not following symlinks. But it could still turn out to be subject to
race conditions on older or alternative `chown` implementations. It
would also be problematic if the Linux kernel hardlink protection is
turned off for some reason.

Upstream does not deem this problematic. I personally suggest to
recursively remove the directory instead, if it is not owned by the
configured user account. A suggested patch can be found in the openSUSE
bug for this issue [2] and is also attached to this email.

# Timeline

2020-05-27: I reported this to the documented upstream security contact
            security@...nga.com.
2020-06-08: I received a reply from upstream pointing me to their already
	    published fix [3], explaining that they don't intend to assign a
            CVE and see no need to fix the recursive `chown -R` line.
2020-06-10: I received a CVE from Mitre to track this issue.

- Update to 2.11.2 This release fixes a problem where the newly introduced
config sync "check-change-then-reload" functionality could cause endless
reload loops with agents. The most visible parts are failing command
endpoint checks with "not connected" UNKNOWN state. Only applies to HA
enabled zones with 2 masters and/or 2 satellites.
\* Bugfixes
- Cluster Config Sync
- Config sync checksum change detection may not work within high
load HA clusters #7565
- Update to 2.11.1 This release fixes a hidden long lasting bug unveiled
with 2.11 and distributed setups. If you are affected by
agents/satellites not accepting configuration anymore, or not reloading,
please upgrade.
\* Bugfixes
- Cluster Config Sync
- Never accept authoritative config markers from other instances
#7552
- This affects setups where agent/satellites are newer than the
config master, e.g. satellite/agent=2.11.0, master=2.10.
- Configuration
- Error message for command\_endpoint should hint that zone is not
set #7514
- Global variable 'ActiveStageOverride' has been set implicitly via
'ActiveStageOverride ... #7521

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-14002.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-14019.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-14004 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-14004)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in Icinga2 before v2.12.0-rc1. The prepare-dirs script (run as part of the icinga2 systemd service) executes chmod 2750 /run/icinga2/cmd. /run/icinga2 is under control of an unprivileged user by default. If /run/icinga2/cmd is a symlink, then it will by followed and arbitrary files can be changed to mode 2750 by the unprivileged icinga2 user.
