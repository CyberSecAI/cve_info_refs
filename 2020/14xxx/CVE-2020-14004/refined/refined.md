Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `prepare-dirs` script of the Icinga2 monitoring software. This script is executed with root privileges as part of the Icinga2 systemd service startup. The script attempts to create and set permissions on directories required by Icinga2. Specifically, the issue arises from the following sequence of actions:

1.  The script checks if the directory `$ICINGA2_INIT_RUN_DIR` (typically `/run/icinga2`) and its subdirectory `cmd` exist. If not, it creates them.
2.  It uses `chmod` to set permissions on `$ICINGA2_INIT_RUN_DIR` to 755 and `$ICINGA2_INIT_RUN_DIR/cmd` to 2750.
3.  It recursively changes the ownership of  `$ICINGA2_INIT_RUN_DIR` to the `icinga` user and `icingacmd` group using `chown -R`.

The vulnerability arises because the `chmod` commands are executed *after* the directories are created. If an attacker (with user `icinga` privileges) creates the directory (or a symlink to another directory), they can then cause the subsequent `chmod` operation to modify the permissions of an arbitrary file or directory on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Symlink Following:** The `chmod` commands, particularly `chmod 2750 "$ICINGA2_INIT_RUN_DIR"/cmd`, follow symlinks. If the `cmd` entry is a symlink, the `chmod` command will change the mode of the target of that symlink, not the symlink itself.
*   **Unprivileged User Influence:** The unprivileged `icinga` user can create the `/run/icinga2` directory or manipulate its content before the `prepare-dirs` script is executed during the service startup/restart, allowing for an attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Permission Modification:** An attacker can change the permissions of any file on the system to 2750 by creating a symlink named `cmd` in the `/run/icinga2` directory.
*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** While the mode `2750` is not directly a full local root exploit, as the `other` user is not allowed to execute, it can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve more significant privilege escalation.
*   **Denial of Service:** By changing the permissions of critical system files or directories, an attacker could cause a denial of service, preventing non-root users access to vital system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  The attacker must gain access to the system with the privileges of the `icinga` user.
2.  The attacker creates or manipulates the `/run/icinga2` directory and its content, specifically replacing the `cmd` directory with a symlink to the target file.
3.  The Icinga2 service is restarted, causing the `prepare-dirs` script to run.
4.  The `chmod 2750 /run/icinga2/cmd` command, following the symlink, alters the permissions of the target file specified by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the machine.
*   **Unprivileged User Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute commands as the `icinga` user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by replacing the separate `mkdir` and `chmod` lines with `mkdir -m <mode>` to make directory creation and mode setting atomic and prevent TOCTOU race conditions.
*   The initial fix did not address the `chown -R` command, but it was later considered less critical as it does not follow symlinks with GNU coreutils' chown.
*   The suggested fix by Matthias Gerstner proposed the replacement of directory creation logic with systemd-tmpfiles configuration and recursive removal of directories before creation if not owned by the configured user account.
