The provided document contains information about multiple CVEs related to Wibu-Systems CodeMeter. Here's the breakdown for CVE-2020-14515:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper verification of cryptographic signatures in the license-file signature checking mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in how CodeMeter verifies the cryptographic signatures of license files. Specifically, it does not properly validate the signature, which allows attackers to create modified, potentially malicious license files that appear valid.
- The vulnerability only affects CmActLicense update files with CmActLicense Firm Code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can forge valid license files, potentially including creating a license file that seems to belong to an existing vendor. This could allow an attacker to bypass licensing restrictions or alter the behavior of software dependent on CodeMeter licenses.
- The impact includes high potential for integrity and availability compromise, with no direct confidentiality impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs some form of access to the affected system.
- The attack requires a high level of effort and user interaction.
- The attacker requires to have the ability to modify or provide a crafted license file to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply or modify a CmActLicense update file with CmActLicense Firm Code.
- User interaction (UI:R) is required to install or use the crafted license file.
- Access to the affected system where CodeMeter is running is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- This CVE is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities found in CodeMeter, and other CVEs are described in the document.
- The document provides links to vendor advisories and mitigation steps.
- The provided CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.4 with vector string (AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H)
