# Infinite loop in xhci\_ring\_chain\_length() in hw/usb/hcd-xhci.c (CVE-2020-14394)

## Host environment

* Operating system: Fedora 33
* OS/kernel version: 5.13.16-100.fc33.x86\_64
* Architecture: x86
* QEMU flavor: qemu-system-x86\_64
* QEMU version: 6.1.50 (v6.1.0-861-g22651bced7)
* QEMU command line:

  ```
  ./x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4G -device nec-usb-xhci,id=xhci,slots=64 -device usb-tablet,bus=xhci.0,port=1,id=usbdev1 -hda fedora32.qcow2
  ```

## Emulated/Virtualized environment

* Operating system: Fedora 32
* OS/kernel version: 5.11.22-100.fc32.x86\_64
* Architecture: x86

## Description of problem

An infinite loop issue was found in the USB xHCI controller emulation of QEMU. Specifically, function `xhci_ring_chain_length()` in hw/usb/hcd-xhci.c may get stuck while fetching empty TRBs from guest memory, since the exit conditions of the loop depend on values that are fully controlled by guest. A privileged guest user may exploit this issue to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.

## Steps to reproduce

Build and load `xhci.ko` from within the guest:

1. make
2. insmod xhci.ko

[Makefile](/-/project/11167699/uploads/98dbf7b4facc9b100817b3c8f63b5cb2/Makefile)

[usb-xhci.h](/-/project/11167699/uploads/f225524b1553d8cf6c1dfa89369b6edc/usb-xhci.h)

[xhci.c](/-/project/11167699/uploads/c635f742d12a2bba6ea472ddfe006d56/xhci.c)

## Additional information

This issue was reported by Gaoning Pan (Zhejiang University) and Xingwei Li (Ant Security Light-Year Lab).

                 CVE-2021-3594 CVE-2021-3595 CVE-2022-0216 CVE-2022-1050
Debian Bug     : 970937 979677 986795 989993 989994 989995 989996 1014589 1014590

Multiple security issues were discovered in QEMU, a fast processor
emulator, which could result in denial of service, information leak,
or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2020-14394

    An infinite loop flaw was found in the USB xHCI controller
    emulation of QEMU while computing the length of the Transfer
    Request Block (TRB) Ring. This flaw allows a privileged guest user
    to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of
    service.

CVE-2020-17380/CVE-2021-3409

    A heap-based buffer overflow was found in QEMU in the SDHCI device
    emulation support. It could occur while doing a multi block SDMA
    transfer via the sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks() routine in
    hw/sd/sdhci.c. A guest user or process could use this flaw to
    crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of
    service condition, or potentially execute arbitrary code with
    privileges of the QEMU process on the host.

CVE-2020-29130

    slirp.c has a buffer over-read because it tries to read a certain
    amount of header data even if that exceeds the total packet
    length.

CVE-2021-3592

    An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP
    networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the
    bootp_input() function and could occur while processing a udp
    packet that is smaller than the size of the 'bootp_t' structure. A
    malicious guest could use this flaw to leak 10 bytes of
    uninitialized heap memory from the host.

CVE-2021-3593

    An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP
    networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the
    udp6_input() function and could occur while processing a udp
    packet that is smaller than the size of the 'udphdr'
    structure. This issue may lead to out-of-bounds read access or
    indirect host memory disclosure to the guest.

CVE-2021-3594

    An invalid pointer initialization issue was found
    in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in
    the udp_input() function and could occur while processing a udp
    packet that is smaller than the size of the 'udphdr'
    structure. This issue may lead to out-of-bounds read access or
    indirect host memory disclosure to the guest.

CVE-2021-3595

    An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP
    networking implementation of QEMU. The flaw exists in the
    tftp_input() function and could occur while processing a udp
    packet that is smaller than the size of the 'tftp_t'
    structure. This issue may lead to out-of-bounds read access or
    indirect host memory disclosure to the guest.

CVE-2022-0216

    A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the LSI53C895A SCSI
    Host Bus Adapter emulation of QEMU. The flaw occurs while
    processing repeated messages to cancel the current SCSI request
    via the lsi_do_msgout function. This flaw allows a malicious
    privileged user within the guest to crash the QEMU process on the
    host, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2022-1050

    A flaw was found in the QEMU implementation of VMWare's
    paravirtual RDMA device. This flaw allows a crafted guest driver
    to execute HW commands when shared buffers are not yet allocated,
    potentially leading to a use-after-free condition.
    Note: PVRDMA is disabled in buster, but this was fixed
    preventively in case this changes in the future.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:3.1+dfsg-8+deb10u10.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1908004#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-12-15 16:32:14 UTC  ``` An infinite loop issue was found in the USB xHCI controller emulation of QEMU. Specifically, function xhci_ring_chain_length() in hw/usb/hcd-xhci.c may get stuck while fetching TRBs from guest memory, since the exit conditions of the loop depend on values that are fully controlled by guest. A privileged guest user may exploit this issue to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1908004#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-12-15 18:22:33 UTC  ``` Created qemu tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1908051](show_bug.cgi?id=1908051 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2020-14394 qemu: infinite loop in xhci_ring_chain_length() in hw/usb/hcd-xhci.c [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1908050](show_bug.cgi?id=1908050 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-14394 qemu: infinite loop in xhci_ring_chain_length() in hw/usb/hcd-xhci.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1908004#c5)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-12-17 15:07:17 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1908004#c0): > Specifically, function xhci_ring_chain_length() in hw/usb/hcd-xhci.c > may get stuck while fetching TRBs from guest memory, since the exit > conditions of the loop depend on values that are fully controlled by guest.  To be more precise, xhci_ring_chain_length() is responsible for computing the size of the Transfer Request Block (TRB) Ring by repeatedly fetching TRBs from the 'dequeue' pointer.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1908004#c6)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-12-17 16:18:06 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw has been rated as having a security impact of Low, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1908004#c7)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-12-21 13:47:53 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Gaoning Pan (Ant Security Light-Year Lab), Xingwei Li (Ant Security Light-Year Lab)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1908004#c12)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2021-09-03 12:48:14 UTC  ``` Was this issue brought to upstream?

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 33 on 2021-11-30. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '33'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 33 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1908050#c3)  Ben Cotton    2021-11-30 17:26:52 UTC  ``` Fedora 33 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2021-11-30. Fedora 33 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this bug.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1908050#c4)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2022-11-30 16:57:45 UTC  ``` Upstream issue & fix: <https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/646> <https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/effaf5a240e03020f4ae953e10b764622c3e87cc>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1908050#c5)  Fedora Update System    2022-12-07 10:37:51 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2022-22b1f8dae2 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 37. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2022-22b1f8dae2>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1908050#c6)  Fedora Update System    2022-12-08 02:10:06 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2022-22b1f8dae2 has been pushed to the Fedora 37 testing repository.
