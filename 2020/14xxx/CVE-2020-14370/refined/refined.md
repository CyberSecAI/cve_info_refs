{
  "cve": "CVE-2020-14370",
  "affected_product": "podman",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `createConfigToOCISpec()` function in `pkg/spec/spec.go` used a shared `DefaultEnvVariables` variable from the `env` package without creating a copy. When multiple containers were created, this led to modifications of the shared variable, causing environment variables from previous containers to leak into subsequent ones.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper sharing of a mutable variable across container creation leading to information disclosure."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with control over subsequent containers could gain access to sensitive information stored in environment variables of previously created containers.",
    "attack_vector": "Creating multiple containers in a short time using the deprecated Varlink API or the Docker-compatible REST API.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must have the ability to create and control containers within the environment. The vulnerability is triggered by creating multiple containers in short succession via Varlink or Docker-compatible REST API.",
    "additional_details": "The Varlink session automatically expires after 60 seconds by default in RHEL 8, so the containers have to be created in a short time to trigger the leak. The vulnerability is triggered when `createConfigToOCISpec()` function is used by the Varlink API or Docker-compatible REST API. OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) is affected because it includes podman, and though the Varlink API is not enabled by default, it can be easily activated."
  },
  "fix": "The issue was fixed by ensuring a copy of the environment variable is made during the container creation, as seen in this commit: https://github.com/containers/podman/commit/a7e864e6e7de894d4edde4fff00e53dc6a0b5074."
