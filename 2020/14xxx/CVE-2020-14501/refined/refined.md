- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication in the `UserServlet` class, which allows alterations to system configuration without proper authorization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication for a critical function within the `UserServlet` class
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can disclose stored credentials, which may lead to further system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability via network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is needed. The attacker can be remote.
