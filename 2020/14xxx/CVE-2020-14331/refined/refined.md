{
  "CVE-2020-14331": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vgacon driver's scroll up implementation uses a circular buffer. When the VT size is changed, the new line might not fit to the end of the scrollback buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local user can cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption), potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by resizing the VGA console via ioctl(VT_RESIZE) which can cause an out-of-bounds write during the scrollback buffer update.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with access to a VGA console (e.g., if booting with 'nomodeset'). The attacker needs to be able to trigger a resize of the terminal."
