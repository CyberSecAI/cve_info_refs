Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-14019:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of `shutil.copyfile` instead of `shutil.copy` in the `python-rtslib-fb` library when saving the target configuration file (`/etc/target/saveconfig.json`). `shutil.copyfile` does not preserve file permissions, unlike `shutil.copy`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect File Permissions:** When saving the target configuration, the permissions of the temporary file are not transferred to the final config file. This results in the configuration file having weak permissions (e.g. `-rw-r--r--` instead of `-rw-------`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  The weakened permissions on `/etc/target/saveconfig.json` could allow unauthorized local users to read the file which contains sensitive configuration data.

*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** If the file contained sensitive information such as credentials or configuration for other services, it could be used for further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:**  A local attacker who already has some access to the system is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must have the ability to access the system locally.

**Technical Details (from GitHub):**

*   The fix involves replacing `shutil.copyfile` with `shutil.copy` when writing out the configuration file. This ensures that the file permissions are preserved.
*   The GitHub pull request #162 ([https://github.com/open-iscsi/rtslib-fb/pull/162](https://github.com/open-iscsi/rtslib-fb/pull/162)) details this fix, also stating that `shutil.copyfile()` will not copy permissions.
*   The `ls` command output before and after the fix shows that the config file is changed from `-rw-r--r--` to `-rw-------`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" severity by both SUSE and Fedora.
*   The fix has been applied in various distributions including Fedora (python-rtslib-2.1.73-1.fc32) and openSUSE (python2-rtslib-fb-2.1.73-lp152.2.3.1, python3-rtslib-fb-2.1.73-lp152.2.3.1)
*   SUSE assigned CVSS v3 base score of 6.2 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) to this vulnerability.
