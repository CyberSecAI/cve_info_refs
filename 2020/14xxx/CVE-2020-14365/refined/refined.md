Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14365:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `dnf` Ansible module was not properly checking GPG signatures when installing packages. This means it would install packages even if they were not signed or had invalid signatures.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing GPG Signature Verification:** The core issue is the failure to enforce GPG signature verification when installing packages using the `dnf` module in Ansible. This vulnerability exists even when `disable_gpg_check` is set to `False` (the default), effectively bypassing the intended security measure.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Package Installation:** An attacker could introduce malicious packages into a `dnf` repository.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Because of the missing signature verification, these malicious packages can then be installed on systems using Ansible. The installation process would execute the scripts included in the malicious package, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user performing the Ansible task.
*  **Compromised System Integrity:** This vulnerability poses a high threat to the integrity and availability of affected systems due to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Compromised `dnf` repository:** An attacker needs to be able to add malicious packages to a repository accessible to the Ansible task.
*  **Ansible playbook execution:** The attacker leverages Ansible playbooks using the dnf module to install packages from the compromised repository on the target systems.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to modify/add packages to a `dnf` repository:** The attacker must have the ability to introduce their own malicious packages in a `dnf` repository used by the target system running Ansible.
*   **Ability to run/control Ansible playbooks:** The attacker needs to be able to execute an Ansible playbook or modify an existing playbook to install the malicious packages.
*  **No specific user privileges needed:** Exploitation does not require any specific privileges as the vulnerability is related to the way Ansible was handling the dnf module.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Ansible Engine versions prior to 2.8.15 and 2.9.13.
*   The vulnerability also affects containerized versions of Ansible Tower prior to versions 3.6.6 and 3.7.3. Non-containerized versions of Ansible Tower are affected and fixed by yum updates or installs.
*   Red Hat Gluster Storage and Red Hat Ceph Storage ship affected versions of ansible. Red Hat Ceph Storage is impacted when using Ansible on Ubuntu.
*   Red Hat OpenStack Platform ships a vulnerable version of Ansible, but is not affected by this vulnerability as it uses yum instead of dnf.
*   The bug report mentions a mitigation, stating it is either unavailable or does not meet the Red Hat criteria for ease of use and deployment.
*   The fix for the vulnerability was released through several errata, including RHSA-2020:3600, RHSA-2020:3601 and RHSA-2020:3602.
