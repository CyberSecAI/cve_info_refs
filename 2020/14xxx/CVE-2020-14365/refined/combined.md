| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1869154#c0)  Borja Tarraso    2020-08-17 06:03:31 UTC  ``` The dnf ansible module is not checking GPG signatures when installing packages. This allows installing malicious packages previously stored in the dnf repository. This could lead in an integrity problem and service availability disruption.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1869154#c2)  Borja Tarraso    2020-08-17 06:03:39 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1869154#c6)  Borja Tarraso    2020-08-21 08:14:28 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Bruno Travouillon (Atos)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1869154#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-09-01 19:30:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.8 for RHEL 7   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.8 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2020:3600 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3600](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A3600)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1869154#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-09-01 19:31:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.9 for RHEL 8   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.9 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2020:3601 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3601](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A3601)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1869154#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-09-01 19:32:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2 for RHEL 7   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2020:3602 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3602](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A3602)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1869154#c15)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-09-02 01:17:27 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2020-14365>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=1869154#c26)  Borja Tarraso    2020-11-03 07:40:40 UTC  ``` Statement:  Ansible Engine 2.8.14 and 2.9.12 as well as previous versions versions are affected.  Ansible Tower 3.7.2 and 3.6.5 as well as previous versions are affected for containerized versions and has been fixed indirectly in the 3.6.6 and 3.7.3 releases. For non-containerized Ansible Tower versions, the fix is provided via yum update or yum install.  Red Hat Gluster Storage(RHGS) 3, Red Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) 2 and 3 ships the affected version of ansible, but they no longer maintain their own version of ansible. Both the products will consume fixes directly from ansible repository. As RHCS 2 and 3 do not use dnf, impact rating is reduced to Low. RHCS still ship ansible separately for Ceph on Ubuntu, but Ubuntu is not impacted by this vulnerability as it uses apt instead of dnf.  Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 and 13 ship a vulnerable version of Ansible, however installation of packages is done via yum instead of dnf so this flaw will have no effect.   ``` |  |

                 CVE-2020-14365 CVE-2021-20228

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Ansible, a configuration
management, deployment and task execution system, which could result in
information disclosure or argument injection. In addition a race
condition in become_user was fixed.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.7+dfsg-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.

For the detailed security status of ansible please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ansible>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
