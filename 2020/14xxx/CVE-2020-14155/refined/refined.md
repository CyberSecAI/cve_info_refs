{
  "CVE-2020-14155": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow when checking the size of a number after (?C, and a subject buffer overread in JIT when UTF is disabled and \\X or \\R has a greater than 1 fixed quantifier.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read",
       "Subject buffer overread"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS). In some cases it may lead to arbitrary code execution or a crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "By processing crafted input with vulnerable versions of PCRE library.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to provide a regex and input that triggers the overflow/overread, possibly requiring knowledge of the vulnerable PCRE library version."
