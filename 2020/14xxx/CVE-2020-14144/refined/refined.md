{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Missing HTML escaping on user-controlled strings within the context popup feature in Gitea.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of the victim's browser session, leading to potential data theft, manipulation, and privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted issue labels.",
      "Maliciously crafted issue titles or bodies.",
      "Inserting a link referencing a malicious issue into the body of a comment."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs a valid Gitea account with write access to a repository. They need to craft a malicious label or inject a specific issue reference to trigger the vulnerability on a user's browser.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability stems from the way Gitea dynamically generates popups for issue references. The content of these popups, including issue titles, bodies, and label names, isn't properly HTML escaped, allowing for arbitrary code injection when a user hovers over a specially crafted link.  The provided github content also provides proof of concept exploit code as well as a more in-depth explanation of the vulnerability.  The content also highlights the ability to chain the XSS vulnerability into a full RCE via git hooks."
