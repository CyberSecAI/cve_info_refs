Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-14349:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how PostgreSQL handles the `search_path` setting during logical replication. Specifically, the `search_path` was not properly sanitized in logical replication walsenders and apply workers. This oversight allows for a scenario where a malicious user can manipulate the `search_path` to execute arbitrary SQL code during replication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Search Path:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of the `search_path` during logical replication. This allows an attacker to inject malicious schemas into the `search_path`.
*   **SQL Injection:** By controlling the `search_path`, an attacker can cause the database to resolve functions and operators from a schema they control, leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL code. This is similar to CVE-2018-1058.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands within the security context of the user running the replication processes. This user is often a superuser, resulting in significant access and control over the database.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** The attacker can access and disclose sensitive information stored within the database.
*   **Integrity Compromise:** The attacker can modify, delete, or corrupt data within the database.
*   **System Availability:** The attacker can cause a denial of service or disrupt the database operation through malicious code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Logical Replication Exploitation:** The attack vector involves exploiting the logical replication mechanism of PostgreSQL.
*   **Search Path Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `search_path` setting.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user in the PostgreSQL database instance involved in the replication.
*   **Replication Publisher or Subscriber:** The attacker needs access to either the publisher or the subscriber database in a replication setup.
*   **Schema Creation Rights:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create objects (such as schemas, functions) within the database, typically in the `public` schema or any other schema that can influence the `search_path`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in PostgreSQL versions prior to 12.4, 11.9, and 10.14.
*   The fix involves setting a secure `search_path` in logical replication walsenders and apply workers, preventing attackers from hijacking function calls.
*   Installations that have adopted a "secure schema usage pattern" might not be vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability affects both publisher and subscriber databases in logical replication.
