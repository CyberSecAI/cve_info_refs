Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of shell metacharacters in `/auth` admin scripts. User-controlled parameters are appended to commands that are then executed using `shell_exec` and `exec`. This allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Shell Metacharacter Injection:** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize or properly handle user-supplied input when constructing shell commands. Directly incorporating user input into commands without proper escaping of shell metacharacters allows for the injection of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Root Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with root privileges. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system, including data breaches, system manipulation, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to vulnerable `/auth` admin scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement for successful exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided document lists this CVE along with other CVEs affecting MK-AUTH 19.01.
* The vulnerable components are located in the `/admin` directory under the `/auth` path.
* The exploit is mentioned as being possible by sending a "well crafted HTTP request."
* The discovery of this vulnerability, along with others, is attributed to Merhawi Solomon Gebrekidan (nitusan).
