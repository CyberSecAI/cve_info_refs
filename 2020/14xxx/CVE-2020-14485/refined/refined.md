**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass authentication.
*   It could also allow for the execution of admin functions, including SQL queries.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack can be performed remotely.
*   A crafted request is utilized to bypass client-side controls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs a low skill level.
