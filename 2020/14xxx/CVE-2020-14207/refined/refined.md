Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the DiveBook WordPress plugin's filter functionality. Specifically, the `filter_diver` GET parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `filter_diver` GET parameter, before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Compromise:** A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to gain access to the entire database, including sensitive information like administrative user credentials (username/password hashes).
*   **Application Compromise:**  By obtaining administrative credentials, an attacker could completely compromise the WordPress application.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could extract any data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious GET request to the WordPress site, specifically targeting the `filter_diver` parameter used by the DiveBook plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the WordPress website where the vulnerable plugin is installed.
*   **Basic understanding of SQL injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft a successful injection payload.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without needing to log in to the WordPress application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content gives more technical details than the typical CVE description, detailing the attack vector, parameters involved and SQL injection method (UNION SELECT).
*   The content also specifies that the WordPress administrative credentials stored in the database could be compromised.
*   The vulnerable plugin version is explicitly stated as v1.1.4.
*   The provided content references two other CVEs related to the same plugin, CVE-2020-14205 (Improper Authorization Check) and CVE-2020-14206 (Unauthenticated Reflected XSS)
