The provided content contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2020-14070.

**CVE-2020-14070:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from guessable credentials within the `admin/executar_login.php` script, coupled with a weak password generation method, making it easy for attackers to bypass authentication and gain administrative access.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Hardcoded user credentials
    *   Poor password generation practice
    *   Incorrect access control

*   **Impact:** An attacker can gain full administrative access to the MK-Auth system, allowing them to perform any administrative actions.
