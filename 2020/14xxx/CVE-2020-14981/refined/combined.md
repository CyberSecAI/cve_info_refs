(https://support.threattracksecurity.com/support/solutions/articles/1000104275-what-is-vipre-password-vault)
## Issue

The VIPRE Password Vault iOS application (version 1.100.1090 and below, later versions have not been tested), does not validate the SSL certificate it receives when connecting to the application login server.
## Impact

An attacker who can perform a man in the middle attack may present a bogus SSL certificate which the application will accept silently.
Sensitive information such as passwords could be captured by an attacker without the user's knowledge.
