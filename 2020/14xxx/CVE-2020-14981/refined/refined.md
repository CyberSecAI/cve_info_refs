- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The VIPRE Password Vault iOS application does not validate the SSL certificate received from the login server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper SSL certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can present a bogus SSL certificate, which the application will accept. This allows the attacker to intercept and capture sensitive information like user passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the iOS application and the login server (e.g., on the same Wi-Fi network).
