The provided content consists of two HTML pages from GitHub, both related to files within the `kuc001/IoTFirmware` repository. Specifically, they link to two PDF files: `kick_ban_wifi_mac_allow_overflow.pdf` and `TRENDnet-kick_ban_wifi.pdf`. The filenames suggest these PDFs might contain details related to a vulnerability. However, the HTML content itself provides no information about the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-14074. Therefore, I am unable to extract any useful information.
