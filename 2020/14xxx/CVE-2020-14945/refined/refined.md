Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-14945:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper access controls in the `SaveUser` API endpoint. The application does not adequately validate and authorize user requests, allowing a low-privileged user to modify parameters related to their user role, wire transfer limits, and permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks. The `SaveUser` endpoint, intended for administrator use, is accessible to low-privileged users.
*   **Insecure API Design:** The API design allows low-privileged users to modify critical parameters that should be restricted to administrative roles.
*   **Parameter Forging:** The application accepts forged parameters from low-privileged users, allowing them to change their own user role, wire limits and permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged authenticated user can elevate their privileges to an administrator ("BankAdmin") role.
*   **Full Application Compromise:** With administrative access, an attacker can potentially achieve full application compromise.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify other user accounts, delete users/admins, create new users, or alter transactions like wire transfers, potentially leading to financial fraud.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can potentially exfiltrate sensitive application data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct API Manipulation:** The attack vector involves directly sending a crafted POST request to the `/WS/AjaxWS.asmx/SaveUser` endpoint.
*   **Parameter Tampering:** The attacker manipulates the `Role`, `WireLimit`, and `Permissions` parameters in the request body to escalate privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid, authenticated user of the application, but with low-level privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application to send the crafted requests.
*   **API Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to understand how the `SaveUser` API endpoint works and which parameters to modify to escalate privileges.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in BSA Radar version 1.6.7234.24750 and lower.
*   The vulnerability was disclosed to the vendor on November 4, 2019, and patched by April 26, 2020.
