  "CVE-2020-14342": {
    "description": "A shell command injection vulnerability exists in the mount.cifs utility of cifs-utils package. By embedding shell commands in the username mount option, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands in the context of the calling user via popen(). This issue is present when cifs-utils is built with --with-systemd.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "cifs-utils 5.6 and later up to 6.10"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of popen() to handle usernames, allowing for shell command injection when a user controls the username mount option.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Shell command injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user calling mount.cifs, potentially escalating privileges to root if the utility is used via sudo.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting a malicious username in the mount.cifs command."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the username mount option and have the ability to invoke mount.cifs with special permissions like sudo rules. The vulnerability is present if the cifs-utils package is built with --with-systemd.",
    "additional_details": [
      "The bug was introduced in June 2012 with commit 4e264031d0da7d3f2.",
       "If mount.cifs has the setuid bit, the command will still be run as the calling user (no privilege escalation).",
      "A wrapper executable around mount.cifs can be installed as a workaround, validating inputs before calling the original mount.cifs",
        "The vulnerability is triggered by popen() calls within the mount.cifs utility, which can be identified by checking for popen() calls using nm.",
      "SUSE rated the CVSS v3 score as 4.4 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)"
    ]
