# 2020.06.22 CVE-2020-14967 RSA RSAES-PKCS1-v1\_5 and RSA-OAEP decryption vulnerability with prepending zeros

Low

[kjur](/kjur)
published
GHSA-xxxq-chmp-67g4
Jun 23, 2020

## Package

jsrsasign
(npm, bower)

## Affected versions

< 8.0.17

## Patched versions

8.0.18

## Description

### Impact

Jsrsasign supports RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 (i.e. RSAES-PKCS1-v1\_5) and RSA-OAEP encryption and decryption. Its encrypted message is represented as BigInteger. When there is a valid encrypted message, a crafted message with prepending zeros can be decrypted by this vulnerability.

* If you don't use RSA PKCS1-v1\_5 or RSA-OAEP decryption, this vulnerability is not affected.
* Risk to forge contents of encrypted message is very low.
* Risk to raise memory corruption is low since jsrsasign uses BigInteger class.

### Patches

Users using RSA PKCS1-v1\_5 or RSA-OAEP decryption should upgrade to 8.0.18.

### Workarounds

Reject RSA PKCS1-v1\_5 or RSA-OAEP encrypted message with unnecessary prepending zeros.

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Thanks to [Antonio de la Piedra](https://github.com/adelapie) for reporting this vulnerability.

# 2020.06.22 CVE-2020-14968 RSA-PSS signature validation vulnerability by prepending zeros

Low

[kjur](/kjur)
published
GHSA-q3gh-5r98-j4h3
Jun 23, 2020

## Package

jsrsasign
(npm, bower)

## Affected versions

3.0.0 - 8.0.16

## Patched versions

8.0.17

## Description

### Impact

Jsrsasign can verify RSA-PSS signature which value can expressed as BigInteger. When there is a valid RSA-PSS signature value, this vulnerability is also accept value with prepending zeros as a valid signature.

* If you are not use RSA-PSS signature validation, this vulnerability is not affected.
* Risk to accept a forged or crafted message to be signed is low.
* Risk to raise memory corruption is low since jsrsasign uses BigInteger class.

### Patches

Users using RSA-PSS signature validation should upgrade to 8.0.17.

### Workarounds

Reject RSA-PSS signatures with unnecessary prepending zeros.

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Thanks to [Antonio de la Piedra](https://github.com/adelapie) for reporting this vulnerability.

## Description

![@adelapie](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5389419?u=21537aef301daa3ad515b0fb38aed9d89a654897&v=4&size=48)[adelapie](https://github.com/adelapie)opened [on Jun 6, 2020](https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/issues/439#issue-632645335)

The jsrsasign 8.0.16 RSA PKCS1 v1.5 decryption implementation does not detect prepended 0's bytes to the ciphertext and accepts modified ciphertexts without error.

You can verify this using the following test vectors from Google Wycheproof:

```
{
  "algorithm" : "RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5",
  "generatorVersion" : "0.8r12",
  "numberOfTests" : 65,
  "header" : [
    "Test vectors of type RsaesPkcs1Decrypt are intended to check the decryption",
    "of RSA encrypted ciphertexts."
  ],
  "notes" : {
    "InvalidPkcs1Padding" : "This is a test vector with an invalid PKCS #1 padding. Implementations must ensure that different error conditions cannot be distinguished, since the information about the error condition can be used for a padding oracle attack. (RFC 8017 Section 7.2.2)"
  },

          "flags" : []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

and proof of concept:

```

var rs = require('jsrsasign');
var obj = require("./rsa_pkcs1.json");

for (let testGroup of obj.testGroups) {

    var keyPem = testGroup.privateKeyPem;

    var prv = new rs.RSAKey();
    prv.readPrivateKeyFromPEMString(keyPem);

    for(let test of testGroup.tests) {
     console.log("[*] Test " + test.tcId + " result: " + test.result)

     try {

      var pt = rs.crypto.Cipher.decrypt(test.ct, prv);
      var result = Buffer.from(pt).toString('hex') === test.msg;

     if (result == true) {
      if (test.result == "valid" || test.result == "acceptable")
       console.log("Result: PASS");
      else
       console.log("Result: FAIL")
     }

     if (result == false) {
      if (test.result == "valid" || test.result == "acceptable")
       console.log("Result: FAIL");
      else
       console.log("Result: PASS")
     }

     } catch (e) {
      console.log("ERROR - VERIFY: " + e)

      if (test.result == "valid" || test.result == "acceptable")
       console.log("Result: FAIL");
      else
       console.log("Result: PASS")

     }

    }
}

```

with result:

```
[*] Test 31 result: invalid
Result: FAIL
[*] Test 31 result: valid
Result: PASS

```

Best regards,

Antonio

Your bugfix and pull request contribution are always welcomed :)

## NOTICE FOR COMMING 11.0.0 RELEASE

The "jsrsasign" library is a long lived JavaScript library from 2010 developed with old JavaScript style and backword compatibility. From coming release 11.0.0, following are planed and suport them gradually:

* Stop to support Internet Explorer.
* Stop to support bower.
* Modern ECMA functions will be introduced such as Promise, let, Array methods or class.

* 2020-Oct-05: jsrsasign won [Google Open Source Peer Bonus Award](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/10/announcing-latest-google-open-source.html). Thank you Google.
* 2020-Sep-23: 10.0.0 released for CMS SignedData related class including timestamp and CAdES architecture update
* 2020-Aug-24: 9.1.0 released to new CRL APIs align with certificate
* 2020-Aug-19: 9.0.0 released for major update of certificate and CSR generation and parsing without backward compatibility. Please see [migration guide](https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/wiki/NOTE-jsrsasign-8.0.x-to-9.0.0-Certificate-and-CSR-API-migration-guide) in detail.
* 2020-Aug-02: twitter account [@jsrsasign](https://twitter.com/jsrsasign) started for announcement. please follow.

## HIGHLIGHTS

* Swiss Army Knife style all in one package crypto and PKI library
* available on [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsrsasign) and browsers
* Long live open source software from 2010
* very easy API to use
* powerful various format key loader and ASN.1 API
* rich document and samples
* no dependency to other library
* no dependency to [W3C Web Cryptography API](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/) nor [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)
* no dependency on newer ECMAScirpt function. So old browsers also supported.
* very popular crypto library with [1M+ npm downloads/month](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=jsrsasign&from=2016-05-01&to=2023-04-20)
* supports "Add-on" architecture

## INSTALL

### Node NPM

```
> npm install jsrsasign jsrsasign-util

```
### Bower

```
> bower install jsrsasign

```
### Or include in HTML from many CDN sites

```
> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jsrsasign/8.0.20/jsrsasign-all-min.js"></script>

```
## USAGE

Loading encrypted PKCS#5 private key:

```
> var rs = require('jsrsasign');
> var rsu = require('jsrsasign-util');
> var pem = rsu.readFile('z1.prv.p5e.pem');
> var prvKey = rs.KEYUTIL.getKey(pem, 'passwd');

```

Sign string 'aaa' with the loaded private key:

```
> var sig = new a.Signature({alg: 'SHA1withRSA'});
> sig.init(prvKey);
> sig.updateString('aaa');
> var sigVal = sig.sign();
> sigVal
'd764dcacb...'

```
