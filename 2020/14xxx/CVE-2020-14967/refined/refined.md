{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The jsrsasign library's RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 and RSA-OAEP decryption implementations do not properly validate the encrypted message, allowing crafted messages with prepended zeros to be decrypted.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of RSA encrypted messages."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially decrypt messages that were meant to be protected by RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 or RSA-OAEP, by prepending zeros to the ciphertext. Although, the risk of forging content is stated to be low.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious ciphertext with prepended zeros.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to manipulate and send modified ciphertext to be decrypted by vulnerable versions of jsrsasign library. No specific position or privilege is required."
