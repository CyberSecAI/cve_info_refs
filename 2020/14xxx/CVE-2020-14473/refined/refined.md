Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **URL Handling Buffer Overflow:** The `mainfunction.cgi` script has a buffer overflow vulnerability in how it handles the `url` parameter in the `web_portal_bypass_ok` and `authuser` actions.  The script escapes special characters in the URL, increasing their length. However, it uses the original, unescaped URL length when allocating a buffer, leading to a buffer overflow when the escaped URL is written to the undersized buffer.
*   **Authentication Header Buffer Overflow:** The `mainfunction.cgi` script has another buffer overflow vulnerability when handling the `HTTP_Authorization` header during login. It decodes the base64 encoded value into a buffer of 0x400 bytes. Then it extracts the username and copies it into a fixed-size 0x40-byte buffer. When the username within the decoded base64 string is larger than 0x40 bytes, it causes a stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** Two distinct stack-based buffer overflows are present in the `mainfunction.cgi` script. These can be triggered through different attack vectors.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate the length of the URL after character escaping and the username extracted from the `Authorization` header before copying them into fixed-size buffers.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerabilities can be triggered without prior authentication to the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:**  Successful exploitation of these buffer overflows could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected devices.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Even if arbitrary code execution is not achieved, exploiting the vulnerability could crash the device or cause instability, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST request with `web_portal_bypass_ok` action:** An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to `cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi` with the `action` parameter set to `web_portal_bypass_ok` or `authuser`, including a long URL with special characters that will expand when escaped.
*   **HTTP POST request to `cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi/login` with crafted Authorization header:** An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi/login` with a crafted `Authorization` header where the base64 decoded username is larger than 0x40 bytes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected DrayTek router.
*   **No authentication Required:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** DrayTek Vigor3900, Vigor2960, and Vigor300B routers.
*   **Fixed Firmware:** The vulnerability is fixed in firmware version 1.5.1.1 and later.
*   **Acknowledgement:** The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Swings from Chaitin Security Research Lab, C0ss4ck from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and MozhuCY from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
*   **PoC (Proof of Concept) Code:** The provided content includes Python PoC code demonstrating both buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
