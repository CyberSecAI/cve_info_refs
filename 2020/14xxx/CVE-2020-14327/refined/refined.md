Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-14327:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaw in Ansible Tower.
*   The "test feature" for lookup credentials allows users to supply a URL that the server will then process. This can be abused to make the server connect to internal services or expose additional internal services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SSRF:** The core vulnerability is the ability to make the server perform requests to arbitrary URLs specified by a user.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate user-supplied URLs, allowing for malicious URLs to be used.
*   **Bypassed Proxy:** The proxy defined in the application settings was not being used, allowing direct requests.
*   **Modifiable Request Body:** The attacker can manipulate the POST request body using the `api_key` parameter.
*   The credential test feature attempts authentication to check credential configuration, which can be abused to make POST requests to internal services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Internal Service Connection:** An attacker can force the server to connect to internal, potentially sensitive services.
*   **Data Exposure:** By querying internal services, attackers can potentially expose data that would otherwise be inaccessible from the outside.
*   **Internal Request Forgery:** The attacker can manipulate requests being made on the internal network, potentially triggering actions or modifying internal data.
*   **Unintended Access:** An attacker can gain access to internal resources or services not meant to be exposed publicly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker supplies a crafted URL through the credential testing feature to trigger the SSRF vulnerability.
*   **HTTP/HTTPS Requests:** The attacker can forge HTTP/HTTPS requests.
*   **Manipulated POST Body:** The attacker controls the body of POST requests made by the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Logged-in User:** Any authenticated user of Ansible Tower can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access to Internal Services:** While the attacker doesn't need direct access, they abuse the server's access to internal services.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Ansible Tower versions 3.7.1, 3.6.4, and prior.
*   The issue is addressed in Ansible Tower versions 3.6.5 and 3.7.2
*   The fix was released in RHSA-2020:3328 and RHSA-2020:3329.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Maxime ESCOURBIAC from Michelin CERT team.
