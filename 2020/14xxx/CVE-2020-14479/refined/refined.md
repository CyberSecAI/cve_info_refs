Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14479:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authentication required to query the server when handling serialized data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306):** The system does not properly authenticate requests before processing serialized data, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information.
- The impact is limited to information disclosure, not remote code execution or modification of system data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
- No privileges are required (PR:N).
- No user interaction is required (UI:N)
- The scope of the vulnerability is unchanged (S:U)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server.
- No special skills are needed, and the attack can be performed remotely.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is related to how the software handles serialized data.
- A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated for this vulnerability, with the vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N). This indicates a medium severity.
- Unlike other vulnerabilities mentioned in the document (e.g., CVE-2020-10644 and CVE-2020-12000), this specific vulnerability does not have a patch. The vendor plans to fix it in future versions.
- Mitigation involves restricting network interaction with the service to only trusted machines through firewalls/allow listing.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-14479 is a medium-severity vulnerability in Inductive Automation Ignition that allows unauthorized access to sensitive information due to missing authentication for critical functions when processing serialized data. The vulnerability is network exploitable and does not require special privileges, with the vendor planning a fix in future product versions.
