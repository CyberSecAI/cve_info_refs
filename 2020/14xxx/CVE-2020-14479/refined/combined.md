## 5. MITIGATIONS

Inductive Automation recommends upgrading the Ignition software to [v8.0.10](https://inductiveautomation.com/downloads/releasenotes/8.0.10)

For those running v7.9.x, it is recommended to upgrade the Ignition software to [v7.9.14](https://inductiveautomation.com/downloads/releasenotes/7.9.14)

**--------- Begin Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------**

Please note CVE-2020-14479 does not have a fix in place. Induction Automation plans to correct this vulnerability in future product versions.

It is recommended to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only clients and servers with a legitimate procedural relationship should be permitted to communicate with the service. This can be done in various ways, most notably with firewall rules/allow listing.

For more information regarding software and patches, please refer to the specified version in Inductive Automation’s [release notes](https://inductiveautomation.com/downloads/ignition/8.0.13).

**--------- End Update B Part 2 of 2 ---------**

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

Fixed

The port on Logix driver device connections can now be configured.

Logix v21 Driver

Fixed

Made optimization improvements for bulk write operations.

Logix v21 Driver

Fixed an issue where timeout exceptions were being ignored during Logix browse. Now, failed attempts will retry the browse while browsing the global scope, as well as when the program scope times out.

Ignition Platform

Designer

Fixed

Launching a Designer or Vision Client from Edge no longer continually restarts due to a change in module status from licensing

Designer

Fixed

Added better error reporting when attempting to edit tags from the Designer while the tag provider is disabled.

Gateway

Fixed

Fixed issue in 7.9 where the Alarm Voice Notification Module would fail to start on certain Java 8 JDKs (i.e OpenJDK8\_b242)

Gateway

Fixed

Gateways will now automatically be assigned a hostname to use for the metro keystore if one wasn’t specified during the first startup.

Fixed

Fixed an issue where the JVM would crash on gateway startup on some ARMv7 devices, due to the SQLite JDBC driver jar. The driver jar has been rolled back to a prior version that does not cause crashes.

Gateway

Feature

On all user sources, the Cache Validation Timeout property can all now be disabled if set to a number less than zero.

Gateway Network

Fixed

Prevents a security issue that could enable attackers to remotely execute code on a gateway via the gateway network.

Gateway Network - Application

Fixed

Fixed an issue where routing to redundant remote gateways can end up targeting the incorrect gateway based on disconnect/reconnect timing.

Gateway Web Interface

Feature

An appropriate error is now displayed when login to the gateway web interface fails due to an LDAP communication issue

Gateway Web Interface

Fixed

Fixed an issue where adding new users or roles to the default user source on Edge gateways could potentially lock up the gateway.

Scripting

Fixed

Updated the timeout parameter description on system.tag.writeSynchronous to state that the value is in milliseconds, not seconds.

OPC-COM

DA

Fixed

Prevents an error that could occur in the COM Tunneler when sending array tags from a server.

OPC-UA

Client

Fixed

Modify OPC UA subscription parameters to reduce load on server and network traffic when values aren't changing.

Client

Fixed

Updated the OPC UA module’s implementation of Milo from 0.3.6 to 0.3.8

Client

Fixed

Fixed a bug that caused high CPU usage by a DefaultDispatcher-worker thread.

Gateway Web Interface

Fixed

Fixed an issue where writing Boolean values via the Quick Client would throw an exception.

Server

Fixed

Fixed cause of spurious "Bad\_SessionIdInvalid" ServiceFault returned to connected OPC UA clients.

Reporting

Report Designer

Fixed

Fixed an issue where enabling the "New Page Per Row" option on reporting table groups could potentially lock up the designer.

Report Designer

Fixed

Fixed an issue where pasting LinkedText from a reporting TextShape component would cause the report designer to become unresponsive.

SFC

Designer

Fixed

Prevents some potential NullPointerExceptions that could occur when starting multiple SFCs simultaneously.

Vision

Client

Fixed

Prevents an IllegalStateException that could occur on Vision Property Change scripts after logging out of the client.

Client

Fixed

Fixed an issue where entering numbers into a Numeric Text Field under some locales (specifically those using commas as decimal separators) could set the value to an incorrect number.

Client

Fixed

Fixed an issue where clients launched from the Native Client Launcher would not be able to print (using both built-in component print functions and the creatPrintJob function) text in tables or labels

Components

Fixed

Updated the Template Canvas component to avoid reloading contained templates if only position properties have changed.

Components

Feature

Added the ability to select a contiguous section of alarms on the Alarm Status Table via shift click.

Designer

Fixed

Fixed an issue where exiting preview mode would not revert titled borders to their untranslated terms.
