| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1874311#c0)  Wade Mealing    2020-09-01 02:29:52 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernels fast user mutex (futex) wait operation which indexed a file (vi inode) mapping that was no longer valid.  This requires an attacker with a local account to be able to issue a FUTEX_WAIT (man futex) on a filesystem which is about to be unmounted.    The superblock operations on this referenced struct would be able to create a use-after-free.    This could allow for memory corruption and possible privilege escalation.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1874311#c3)  Wade Mealing    2020-09-01 04:20:58 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git/commit/?id=8019ad13ef7f64be44d4f892af9c840179009254>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1874311#c6)  Wade Mealing    2020-09-01 04:54:43 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1874332](show_bug.cgi?id=1874332 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-14381 kernel: referencing inode of removed superblock in get_futex_key() causes UAF.

futex: Fix inode life-time issueAs reported by Jann, ihold() does not in fact guarantee inode
persistence. And instead of making it so, replace the usage of inode
pointers with a per boot, machine wide, unique inode identifier.
This sequence number is global, but shared (file backed) futexes are
rare enough that this should not become a performance issue.
