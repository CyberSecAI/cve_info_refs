Internet security is a great concern for both individuals and organizations of all sizes. The internet has become part of people’s everyday lives and is some­thing users rely on when it comes to work, entertainment, education, banking, shopping, communication and much more. Weak internet security poses great risks to valuable personal and financial information. F‑Secure Internet Security helps you prevent the loss of sensitive information, identity theft and computer virus infections.

### What are common internet threats?

There are numerous cyber threats that can put your devices and valuable information at risk. These include malware, such as computer viruses, ransom­ware and spyware, just to name a few common ones.

Online criminals can also use phishing scams and social engineering to trick their victims into giving away personal information, such as online banking credentials, pass­words and verification codes.

### How to protect devices against viruses and other malware?

You can do a great deal to protect your­self online just by being careful and aware of the various threats that can compromise your personal cyber security. However, you also need an advanced internet security solution to fend off malware, protect your online banking and monitor suspicious online activity.

With a reliable internet security solution in place, make sure to also keep all soft­ware and apps up-to-date and only down­load files and programs you trust. Suspicious links and email attachments may hide viruses or lead to scam web­sites.

Never click any­thing that you’re unsure of. Especially unprompted offers and free down­loads can be risky for your cyber security. It also helps to stay up to speed with the latest trends in cyber security, so you can identify online dangers when you encounter them.

### Does internet security protect my money online?

Strong internet security prevents your financial information and login credentials to your online bank from getting into the wrong hands. F‑Secure Internet Security adds an additional layer of protection when­ever you do your banking or shopping online by establishing a secure connection and checking that the web­site you are using is safe.

Consider also getting a secure VPN for your devices, especially if you do your banking and online shopping using a public Wi‑Fi network. Unfortunately, a free VPN may do more harm than good by collecting and selling your personal information. With [F‑Secure Total](/en/total), you get complete security, true online privacy and identity protection in one app, including our secure VPN.

The Scam protection included in F-Secure Internet Security helps you avoid online shopping scams, phishing websites and SMS message scams. All these can endanger your money either directly, or by compromising your personal information. With Scam protection you can automatically block these threats, keeping your money safe from online scams.

### Do mobile devices need an internet security solution?

We recommend getting an internet security solution for your smart­phone and tablet as well. Just like computers, mobile devices are vulnerable to internet threats, such as viruses and hacking attempts. F‑Secure Internet Security offers powerful protection for both mobile (iOS & Android) and desktop computers.

### How do parental controls work?

Parental controls help you keep younger internet users safe from online content that is inappropriate for their age. This includes content suitable only for adults and gambling, for instance. With the parental controls in F‑Secure Internet Security, you can limit children’s access to such content as well as block certain apps that are intended for older users only. Internet Security also allows you to limit screen time so children use their devices only for the agreed amount of time every day. Limiting what kind of content children have access to helps prevent them from down­loading malware or accessing dangerous sites on the internet.

### How to scan for malware with the Internet Security anti­virus scanner?

F‑Secure Internet Security’s anti­virus scanner helps you identify viruses and other malware that can pose a threat to you and your devices. Internet Security’s real-time anti­virus scanner checks all files when they are accessed and blocks ones that contain malware. The harmful file is then quarantined before it can cause any harm. In addition to a real-time scanner, F‑Secure Internet Security lets you run a manual virus scan for checking for potentially harmful files or unwanted applications that may be hiding on your device.

### How does Browsing Protection work?

When turned on, F‑Secure Internet Security’s Browsing Protection blocks harmful web­sites and stops them from causing harm to your device. Some harmful web­sites may seem safe on the outside, but can still contain suspicious and dangerous content. Browsing Protection stops you from accessing such spam sites or other web­sites that can down­load unwanted apps, illegal material or malware to your device. You can also manually block and allow sites with F‑Secure Internet Security and its Browsing Protection.

### Why choose F‑Secure Internet Security?

With F‑Secure Internet Security, you get all of these with support for different devices including mobile, both on Android and iOS devices.
