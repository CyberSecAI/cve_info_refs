Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2020-14988:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Insufficient input sanitization of the `loginmessage` parameter in the login portals of `/cms` and `/cms/console` endpoints.
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied content in several areas including:
    *   Content editor, using an `embed` element with a `data:` URL.
    *   Folder names when creating a new folder for translations.
    *   Link page field when creating a new author.
    *   Profile picture upload, using a malicious SVG image with an `onload` event.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** Allows injection of JavaScript code into the login page via the `loginmessage` parameter, affecting unauthenticated users.
*   **Stored XSS:** Allows persistent injection of malicious JavaScript code through various input fields, impacting users who access the modified content or profile.
*   **Insufficient input sanitization:** The application doesn't properly validate or sanitize user inputs in multiple contexts allowing injection of malicious code.
*   **Lack of proper encoding:** The application does not properly encode data before rendering it on the page, leading to XSS.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when the victim clicks a malicious link, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
*   **Stored XSS:** Attackers can persistently inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed each time a user accesses the affected content or page. This can lead to widespread compromise of user sessions and data.
*   An attacker can achieve remote code execution by combining the described XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** Requires a user to click on a maliciously crafted link containing the XSS payload in the `loginmessage` parameter.
*   **Stored XSS:** Requires an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code through the vulnerable input fields (content editor, folder name, author link, profile image) which are then stored and executed when the affected page or content is viewed.
*   **Combined Attack Vector:** An attacker can use stored XSS to create a malicious page that, when visited by an administrator, exploits a CSRF vulnerability, and ultimately leads to Remote Code Execution.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and lure a user to click on it. No authentication is required.
*   **Stored XSS:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create/edit content, author profiles, or upload profile pictures within the application, often requiring some level of access/privilege.
*    **Combined RCE Attack:** Requires the attacker to have access to create content to inject malicious code using stored XSS, and the ability to lure a privileged user (administrator) to visit the malicious page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The report details multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities in different parts of the application, indicating a systemic problem with input sanitization.
*   The content provides detailed steps to reproduce each XSS vulnerability, as well as the combined CSRF+RCE attack.
*   The combination of multiple vulnerabilities, such as the ability to bypass CSRF protection and execute arbitrary code, highlights the importance of layered security.
*   The vendor is aware of the RCE vulnerability but has not fixed it and instead recommends restricting access to the functionality.
