The provided content is related to CVE-2020-14017.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Navigate CMS stores session information in plaintext files within the webroot.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Session information is stored in plaintext files.
- These session files are publicly accessible to unauthenticated users.
- The provided .htaccess files intended to restrict access to the session directory do not function as expected in later versions of Apache HTTPD.
- Sensitive information like CSRF tokens are stored within these session files

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can access sensitive session information, including CSRF tokens. If directory listing is enabled, attackers can simply browse the directory and access session files. If directory listing is disabled, attackers can still access the session files through brute-forcing session IDs.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct access to the session directory if directory listing is enabled on the web server.
- Bruteforcing session IDs to access individual session files when directory listing is disabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the web server.
