Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input during file uploads within Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center. This allows an attacker to embed malicious HTML or JavaScript code within a file.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious code injected during file upload is stored on the server and executed when other users access the affected content (e.g., view the uploaded file).

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to various attacks such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement
    *   Phishing
    *   Unauthorized access to data
    *   Malware distribution

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted file containing malicious HTML/JavaScript code through the file upload feature of Jira.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote.
    *   **Jira Access:** The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the Jira instance. This might require user privileges within Jira.
