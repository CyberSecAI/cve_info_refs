Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-14369:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Red Hat CloudForms

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application is susceptible to CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to force an authenticated user to perform unwanted actions on the web application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could craft malicious HTTP requests that, when triggered by an authenticated user, perform state-changing requests such as provisioning virtual machines (VMs) or running Ansible playbooks without the user's consent or knowledge.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a custom flash file that can be used to make a forged HTTP request to the server.
- This crafted request, if triggered by an authenticated user, forces the user to perform state changing requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to deliver the malicious flash file to a victim that is already authenticated to the vulnerable CloudForms application.
- The attacker needs to craft a specific request that will perform the intended state changing action.
