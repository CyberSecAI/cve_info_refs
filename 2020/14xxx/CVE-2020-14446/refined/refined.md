      "source": "cybersecurityworks.com_54c56bbe_20250119_125448.html",
      "details": {
        "affected_product": "WSO2 IS as Key Manager 5.9.0 or earlier, WSO2 Identity Server 5.9.0 or earlier",
        "vulnerability": "Client-side open redirect arises when an application incorporates user-controllable data into the target of a redirection in an unsafe way. XSS payload is allowed to redirect the user to the external domain in the product WSO2 Identity Server version 5.9.0.",
        "poc": "The vulnerability was tested on WSO2 Identity Server Manager version 5.9.0.  By navigating to the Policy Administration, clicking the Add New Entitlement Policy Link, and then clicking Write Policy in XML, the URL opens and Editor. Entering a domain (e.g., http://evil.com) in the variable CallbackURL, saves the entered domain in the DOM object and reflects it in the Response body.  Forwarding the request and clicking the Cancel button triggers the URL navigation script and redirects to the custom entered domain.",
        "impact": "An attacker can construct a URL within the application that causes a redirection to an arbitrary external domain. This behavior can be leveraged to facilitate phishing attacks against users of the application.",
        "remediation": "Download and apply the relevant fixes based on the changes from the public fix: <https://github.com/wso2/carbon-identity-framework/pull/2848>"
