  "CVE-2020-14385": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before 5.9-rc4. A failure of the file system metadata validator in XFS can cause an inode with a valid, user-creatable extended attribute to be flagged as corrupt. This can lead to the filesystem being shutdown, or otherwise rendered inaccessible until it is remounted, leading to a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
    "root_cause": "The file system metadata validator in XFS has a bug in the boundary test of xfs_attr_shortform_verify which can cause a valid extended attribute to be flagged as corrupt.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read due to an integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service (filesystem shutdown, system crash, or memory corruption) due to the file system metadata validator in XFS incorrectly detecting a valid extended attribute as corrupt.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to XFS filesystem"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access to an XFS filesystem is required."

  "CVE-2020-0432": {
    "description": "In skb_to_mamac of networking.c, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an integer overflow. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",

    "weaknesses": [
     "Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds write",
      "Improper bounds checking"
    ],

    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access with no additional execution privileges needed"

    "CVE-2020-0427": {
        "description": "In create_pinctrl of core.c, there is a possible out of bounds read due to a use after free. This could lead to local information disclosure with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",

    "description": "The rbd block device driver in drivers/block/rbd.c in the Linux kernel through 5.8.9 used incomplete permission checking for access to rbd devices, which could be leveraged by local attackers to map or unmap rbd block devices, aka CID-f44d04e696fe.",
