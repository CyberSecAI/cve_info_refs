Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way JerryScript's `ecma_op_internal_buffer_append` function handles adding entries to the internal buffer of Map and WeakMap objects. Specifically, the key and value pairs were being added separately. This could lead to a garbage collection cycle being triggered between adding the key and its corresponding value. During the garbage collection marking phase, the code might encounter a partially constructed map entry (key but no value), leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** A race condition exists between appending the key and the value to a Map or WeakMap's internal buffer and the garbage collector, causing a partial entry.
- **Memory Corruption:** The garbage collector's marking process can read invalid memory due to partially created map entries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Segmentation Fault/Crash:** The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault and program crash.
- **Unspecified Behavior:** The corrupted memory could lead to further unpredictable behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted JavaScript program that creates and modifies a Map object in a specific way. Specifically, it seems the length of the file name in the execution steps is a factor.
- The program uses `unshift` on a variable as part of a loop, creating a Map, and assigning it to a prototype of a new object, triggering the vulnerability through `ecma_op_container_set`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious JavaScript program within a JerryScript environment.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate objects to trigger garbage collection during the vulnerable operations.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code examples show how to trigger the crash using a specific JavaScript program.
- The fix involves adding both the key and value at the same time using `ecma_collection_append`, preventing partially constructed entries.
- The issue is linked to commit `c2b662170245a16f46ce02eae68815c325d99821`, which addresses the bug.
