Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2020-14939:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `load_game_data` function in `savestruct_internal.c`, which directly executes Lua code from the game's save file (`.sav.gz`). The game does not sanitize or sandbox the Lua code, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary Lua code.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization or sandboxing of Lua code from save files. The game directly interprets and executes the Lua code.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine by crafting a malicious save file. The provided example shows the use of `os.execute("xcalc")` to trigger a calculator, but the impact could be much more severe if an attacker used more malicious code.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A user loads a crafted save file (.sav.gz) from an untrusted source (downloaded, received from another user, etc.). The attacker modifies the save file to include malicious Lua code.
    *   The game interprets the embedded lua code when loading a save file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Ability to modify the game's save file (`.sav.gz`).
    *   Ability to deliver the crafted save file to the victim.
*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The vulnerability is located in the `savestruct_internal.c` file, specifically the `load_game_data` function.
    *   The game uses a library function to execute the unsanitized Lua code.
