# [EN] A-Z: FreedroidRPG - save game

FreedroidRPG is an open source hack and slash game. In other words, it’s a Diablo clone available on Linux.
I became interested in how the game handles untrusted user input, but as it’s a single player game supplying malicious input is limited. So I decided to analyze the parser of saved games and whether it may be somehow abused. I found a few memory corruption vulnerabilities and a way to execute arbitrary code.

[![screenshot](/images/freedroid-50.png)](/images/freedroid.png)

A single save consists of two files: `NAME.shp` and `NAME.sav.gz`.
Let’s look into the first one.

## NAME.shp

`NAME.shp` is a gzipped text file, so we can get its content using following commands:

```
$ mv NAME.shp NAME.gz
$ gunzip NAME.gz
$ cat NAME
[...]
Levelnumber: 0
xlen of this level: 90
ylen of this level: 90
floor layers: 2
light radius bonus of this level: 12
minimal light on this level: 19
infinite_running_on_this_level: 1
random dungeon: 0
[...]
```

It contains many parameters describing the played level. This kind of file is parsed by functions: `LoadShip`, `decode_level`, `decode_level` in <https://gitlab.com/freedroid/freedroid-src/blob/master/src/map.c>.
Some of the parsed values coming from the file are used to calculate offsets to memory. The parsing functions lack validation of read values and do not expect that someone may alter data. Usually, users do not edit their own save files (unless they want to cheat, but it’s a different subject), but in some game communities, it is quite common to exchange save game files with other players. So unaware users may download or receive manipulated files leading to some undesired behavior.

### First crash

The first problem I found in following code:

```
803	static char *decode_map(level *loadlevel, char *data)
825		this_line = (char *)MyMalloc(4096);

845  	for (col = 0; col < loadlevel->xlen; col++) {

850  			tmp = strtol(this_line + 4 * (loadlevel->floor_layers *
col + layer), NULL, 10);
```

At line 825 we can see that `this_line` has a fixed size of 4096 bytes. Then, at line 850 this memory is accessed, but offset is calculated using values `loadlevel->xlen` and `loadlevel->floor_layers`. Both of these values come from the file and `loadlevel` is a structure representing it. So if user edits the `NAME.shp` file and sets big enough values, for example: `floor layers: 48` or `xlen of this level: 2048`, the function will read outside memory buffer.

```

### Second crash

The second problem is related to two similar fragments of code parsing two fragments of the file that don’t have a fixed size.

In the save game we can find:

```
[...]
beginning_of_map
116   0 116   0 116   0 116   0 116   0 116   0 116   0 116   0 116   0 116   0 116   0 116   0 116   0 116   0 116   0 116   0 116   0 116 558  47 501   0 524   0 524   0 521  47 502  25   0  23   0   0 521  25   0  23   0  47 500   0 521   0 52
[...]
```

and code responsible for parsing it:

```
825 	this_line = (char *)MyMalloc(4096);

837  		while (map_begin[curlinepos + nlpos] != '\n')
838  			nlpos++;
839  		memcpy(this_line, map_begin + curlinepos, nlpos);
```

Again we meet fixed buffer `this_line`. This part of code tries to copy data resisting between `beginning_of_map` tag and newline character announcing the end of the value. The function assumes that data between the tag and newline character will fit to the `this_line` buffer. It’s not true as malicious user can modify the save and put more than 4096 characters in that place. If a such modified save is loaded the game will write data outside the buffer.

```

#### Second crash, part 2

The problem is exactly the same for parsing this part of the save.

```
[...]
wp
Nr.=  0 x=  27 y=  17 rnd=0      c:    1  53
[...]
```

However, it occurs in another function:

```
875 static char *decode_waypoints(level *loadlevel, char *data)
896	this_line = (char *)MyMalloc(4096);

902 	while (wp_begin[curlinepos + nlpos] != '\n')
903			nlpos++;
904		memcpy(this_line, wp_begin + curlinepos, nlpos);
```

If data between `wp` and newline character is longer than 4096 bytes, than the same vulnerability occurs - data is written outside the buffer.

## NAME.sav.gz

The second file is also a gzipped text file, but its content is quite different.

```
game_config{
played_game_act = [=[act1]=],
}
tux_t{
current_game_date = 0.208548,
current_power_bonus = 0,
power_bonus_end_date = -1.000000,
current_dexterity_bonus = 0,
dexterity_bonus_end_date = -1.000000,
light_bonus_end_date = 0.000000,
speed = {
x = 0.000000,
y = 0.000000,
},
```

If we look into the [code](https://gitlab.com/freedroid/freedroid-src/blob/master/src/savestruct_internal.c) parsing we will notice that it’s Lua code being interpreted while loading the save.

```
void load_game_data(char *strin)
{
	// Add the table constructors called by Lua when parsing a savegame

[...]
	// Parse the configuration file, calling table constructors to create the
	// associated C data structures

	run_lua(LUA_DIALOG, strin);
}
```

So, in this case, the attacker has a much easier job. It’s possible to put any Lua code we want, for example `os.execute("xcalc")`.

## Summary

Even single player games are susceptible to malicious input. Every kind of data we deliver to our games (save games, mods, additional maps, etc.) can be a way of triggering potential vulnerabilities in code. In the case of FreedroidRPG, it was possible to cause some (but I don’t know if exploitable in practice) memory corruption and what is worse, execute arbitrary code.
