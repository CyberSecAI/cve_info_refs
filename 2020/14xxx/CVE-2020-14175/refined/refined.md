- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within user macro parameters, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into affected pages, potentially leading to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through user macro parameters. An attacker could craft a malicious payload within the parameter of a user macro.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the user macro parameters, and the attack is remote.
