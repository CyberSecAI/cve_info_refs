## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

```
It is sometimes necessary to restrict the options that can be set
inline, ie. using the {::options ...} extensions.

By default, the template option is now forbidden to avoid possible
security problems. This addresses [CVE-2020-14001](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mqm2-cgpr-p4m6 "CVE-2020-14001").

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## kramdown 2.3.0 released

Although this is a minor version bump there is **one breaking change**: Parsing of XML processing
instructions was removed because they are invalid for HTML5 documents.

This change should only affect a negligible amount of existing kramdown documents since XML
processing instructions were never something a normal user would use.

Additionally, CVE-2020-14001 (reported by Javier Rivera) is
addressed to avoid problems when using the `{::options /}` extension together with the ‘template’
option. **This means updating is highly recommended!**

## Changes

* 2 major changes:

  + New option ‘forbidden\_inline\_options’ to restrict the options allowed with the `{::options /}`
    extension. This also addresses the security issue described in [CVE-2020-14001](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-14001).
  + Parsing of XML processing instructions is not done anymore for kramdown documents because they
    are invalid for HTML5 (fixes issue [#660](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/660) by Samuel Williams)
* 1 minor change:

  + Several internal changes with respect to memory usage and performance (PRs [#654](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/654), [#655](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/655),
    [#665](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/665) by Ashwin Maroli)
* 2 bug fixes:

  + Extend allowed characters in IDs set with headers to all characters allowed by XML (fixes [#658](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/658)
    by Samuel Williams)
  + Fix thread safety issue by moving global state into an instance variable (fixes [#663](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/663)
    by Samuel Williams)
* 1 other change:

  + Documentation fixes and updates (issue [#662](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/662) by Samuel Williams, PR [#656](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/656) by Noah Doersing)

## kramdown 2.0.0 released

This is a major release with breaking changes!

The most notable changes are that Ruby 2.3 is now required, Rouge is the new default syntax
highlighter and that several extension have been extracted to their own repository and Rubygem.

All extracted extensions are now officially **unmaintained** - if anybody wants to step in, please
contact me.

There are also some minor changes and bug fixes, most notable:

* Paragraphs with a single image can now be rendered as `<figure>` elements.
* Footnote IDs can now be made unique using the new option `footnote_prefix`. Together with the
  exposed count of footnotes it is now possible to render multiple documents into one output file:

  ```
  require 'kramdown/document'
  total_footnotes = 0
  documents = [
    "footnote[^a][^a]\n\n[^a]: My note\n[^b]: another (ignored) note",
    "footnote[^a][^a]\n\n[^a]: My note\n[^b]: another (ignored) note",
    "footnote[^a][^a]\n\n[^a]: My note\n[^b]: another (ignored) note",
  ]

  documents.each do |document|
    options = {footnote_nr: total_footnotes + 1, footnote_prefix: total_footnotes + 1}
    document = Kramdown::Document.new(document, options)
    puts document.to_html
    total_footnotes += document.root.options[:footnote_count]
  end

  ```

## Changes

* 3 major changes:

  + Require at least Ruby 2.3 (fixes [#557](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/557) by Matt Schreiber)
  + Rouge is the new default syntax highlighter instead of Coderay
  + `Kramdown::Utils::OrderedHash` has been removed in favor of `Hash`
  + The following extension have been moved into their own repository and Rubygem:
    - [GFM parser](https://github.com/kramdown/parser-gfm)
    - [PDF converter](https://github.com/kramdown/converter-pdf)
    - [coderay syntax highlighter](https://github.com/kramdown/syntax-coderay)

    [#523](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/523) by Dan Allen)
  + Guessing of the syntax highlighting language with rouge is now only performed if the `guess_lang`
    option is set
  + Paragraphs with a single image can now be rendered as a `<figure>` element by specifying the
    `standalone` IAL reference (fixes issues [#48](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/48) by Gilbert Townshend and [#98](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/98) by Luca Barbato)
  + Add option `footnote_prefix` for avoiding duplicate IDs when rendering multiple documents (fixes
    issue [#483](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/483) by Peter Poole)

## kramdown 1.16.1 released

Hot on the heels of 1.16.0 this bug fix release fixes problems with the new GFM task list
implementation, so upgrading is recommended!

## Changes

* 1 bug fix:

  + Fix the GFM task list implementation (fixes [#476](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/476), reported by Brandon Zarrella)

Published on Monday, 27 November 2017
## kramdown 1.16.0 released

This release brings, amongst other things, support for setting default options for the kramdown
binary via a configuration file, two new options (‘typographic\_symbols’ and
‘footnote\_backlink\_inline’) and the new server-side math engine [SsKaTeX](math_engine/sskatex.html) which doesn’t need the
whole NodeJS stack to work properly.

Please also note that the [MathjaxNode](math_engine/mathjaxnode.html) math engine now relies on the `mathjax-node-cli` package
instead of the `mathjax-node` package to work correctly. Make sure you update your NodeJS
installation accordingly.

Thanks to all the contributors and supporters that made this release possible!

## Changes

    LaTeX converters (fixes [#472](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/472) requested by Kyle Barbour)
  + New option ‘footnote\_backlink\_inline’ to allow placing the footnote backlink into the last,
    possibly nested paragraph or header instead of creating a new paragraph (fixes [#454](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/454) requested
    by Kyle Barbour)

This release fixes the GFM header ID generation for more cases, updating is *very* recommended.

## Changes

* 1 bug fix:

  + Fix GFM header ID generation when code spans, math elements, entities, typographic symbols or
    smart quotes are used (fixes [#391](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/391) reported by Nick Fagerlund)

Published on Sunday, 20 November 2016
## kramdown 1.13.0 released

The biggest change in this release is the introduction of a converter for [man pages](converter/man.html). Although
there already exist two solutions ([ronn](http://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/) and [kramdown-man](https://github.com/postmodern/kramdown-man)), both are not completely satisfactory:

* Ronn doesn’t use standard Markdown syntax for all elements.
* kramdown-man only converts a subset of the available element types.

The new man page converter uses standard kramdown syntax and supports nearly all element types,
including tables.

This release also brings some enhancements for the GFM parser. One thing to note is that the header
ID generation is now more compatible to GFM which also means that **some IDs will be different** -
so check the documents on which you use the GFM parser, especially when you are using Jekyll or
Github Pages.

Organizational-wise, issues and pull requests on Github that pertain to feature requests have been
closed and are now tracked through a dedicated [kramdown project on
Github](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/projects/1).

## Changes

* 4 minor changes:

  + Add new converter for man pages
  + Header ID generation for the GFM parser is now more compatible to GFM (fixes [#267](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/267), requested
    by chadpowers)
  + Update to the MathJax math engine to allow formatting the preview as `code` / `pre > code` (pull
    request [#372](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/372) by Florian Klampfer)
  + Allow tabs in table separator lines (pull request [#370](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/370) by Shuanglei Tao)
* 2 bug fixes:

  + Compactly nested lists are now handled correctly after fixing a bug in indentation detection
    (fixes [#368](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/368) reported by Christopher Brown)
  + GFM parser: Allow indenting the delimiting lines of fenced code blocks for better GFM
    compatibility (pull request [#369](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/369) by Shuanglei Tao)
* 2 other fixes and enhancements:

  + Added information on how to run tests to `README.md` (fixes [#377](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/377) reported by Aron Griffis)
  + Added information about how to use KaTeX with the MathJax math engine (fixes [#292](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/292) reported by
    Adrian Sieber, information by Dato Simó)

Published on Monday, 15 August 2016
## kramdown 1.12.0 released

This release features two enhancements for definition lists:

1. IALs can now be applied to definition terms:

   ```
   {:.classy} term
   : and its definition

   ```
2. IDs for definition terms can now be created automatically (similar to header IDs) and optionally
   assigned a prefix:

   ```
   {:auto_ids}
   term1
   : definition

   term2
   : definition

   ^

   {:auto_ids-prefix}
   term1
   : definition

   term2
   : definition

   ```

Furthermore, compatibility of the GFM parser has been improved in regards to
list/blockquotes/codeblocks that are used directly after a paragraph (i.e. without a blank line).

## Changes

* 4 minor change:

  + Allow using an IAL for definition terms (`<dt>`) as is already possible with definitions
    themselves (`<dd>`)
  + Added automatic generation of IDs (with optional prefix) for terms of definition lists (fixes
    [#355](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/355), requested by Greg Wilson)
  + Removed obfuscation for e-mail links (fixes [#343](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/343), requested by Anton Tsyganenko)
  + New option ‘gfm\_quirks’ for enabling/disabling parsing differences of the GFM parser with
    respect to the kramdown parser

## kramdown 1.7.0 released

This release brings among other things support for the ‘minted’ syntax highlighter for LaTeX and a
new math engine based on MathJax-Node that outputs to MathML.

## Changes

* 4 minor changes:

  + The syntax highlighter [‘minted’](syntax_highlighter/minted.html) for the [LaTeX
    converter](converter/latex.html) is now available (fixes issue [#93](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/93), initial patch [#242](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/242) by

## kramdown 1.6.0 released

This release contains many fixes and minor enhancements as well as one major goodie that comes with
a small caveat: block IALs can now be applied to link and abbreviation definitions!

It may not sound like much but allowing block IALs to be applied to link definitions alleviates the
problem that additional attributes could only be specified via span IALs. Now such attributes can be
stored together with the URL and title at the link definition, for example:

```
This is a ![resized image].

[resized image]: some_image.jpg "with a title"
{: height="36px" width="36px" style="border: 1px solid green"}

```

There is one **small caveat**, though. Regard the following construct:

```
[linkdef]: http://example.com
{:.block-ial}
block element, e.g. a paragraph

```

The block IAL would have been applied to the paragraph in previous versions but now it is applied to
the link definition. However, such a construct is not very likely encountered in the real world.

## Changes

* 7 minor changes:

  + Block IALs can now be applied to link and abbreviation definitions (inspired by issue [#194](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/194)
    from cabo)
  + The syntax highlighting engine for Rouge now allows custom formatter classes to be used (issue
    [#214](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/214), requested by BackOrder)
  + The MathJax math engine now allows adding previews (issue [#225](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/225), requested by jethrogb)
  + The “toc\_levels” option can now also take a Range object (pull request [#210](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/210) by Jens Krämer)
  + The generated table of contents of the HTML converter now contains ID attributes on the links so
    that back-references can be used (issue [#195](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/195), requested by Ciro Santilli)
  + A warning is now generated when duplicate HTML attributes are detected (issue [#201](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/201), requested
    by winniehell)
  + Updated used version of prawn to 2.0.0
* 8 bug fixes:

  + Fixed [#192](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/192): Emphasis by using underscore sometimes wrongly worked within a word (reported by
    Michael Franzl)
  + Fixed [#198](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/198): Empty alt attributes on `<img>` tags are now correctly handled by the kramdown
    converter (reported by winniehell)
  + Fixed [#200](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/200): Trailing whitespace is now really removed in paragraphs (reported by winniehell)
  + Fixed [#220](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/220): HTML blocks with attributes weren’t correctly detected when directly after another
    block (reported by Bill Tozier)
  + Fixed [#199](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/199): Empty title attributes are now ignored for images when using the kramdown
    converter (reported by and pull request [#206](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/206) from winniehell)
  + Leading and trailing white space from math statements is now stripped as the whitespace
    sometimes lead to LaTeX conversion errors
  + Fixed [#226](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/226): Class names may now start with a dash in IALs/ALDs (reported by Adam Hardwick)
  + Multiple consecutive block IALs before an element are now correctly processed

## kramdown 1.5.0 released

This release brings the addition of [Rouge](syntax_highlighter/rouge.html) as supported syntax highlighting engine besides Coderay
as well as support for MathML output in the HTML converter through the libraries [Ritex](math_engine/ritex.html) or
[itex2MML](math_engine/itex2mml.html) as alternatives to MathJax.

By restructuring the code it will now be very easy to add other syntax highlighters or math engines
in the future.

Please also note that the old ‘coderay\_\*’ options are still supported but they are *deprecated* as
of now. It is recommended to use the new [‘syntax\_highlighter’](options.html#option-syntax-highlighter) and [‘syntax\_highlighter\_opts’](options.html#option-syntax-highlighter-opts)
options instead. The latter also take precedence over the former ‘coderay\_\*’ options.

## Changes

* 6 minor changes:

  + Syntax highlighters are now configurable via the new [‘syntax\_highlighter’](options.html#option-syntax-highlighter) option.
  + [Rouge](syntax_highlighter/rouge.html) has been added as alternative to Coderay for syntax highlighting (requested originally
    as Pgyments support in [#24](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/24) by Jonathan Martin and then [#68](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/68#issuecomment-30100236) by Eric Mill and [#141](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/141) by
    Jeanine Adkisson).
  + The `<div>` tag surrounding syntax highlighted code now gets a class `highlighter-NAME`
    attached where NAME is the syntax highlighter used (requested in [#76](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/76) by Marvin Gülker)
  + Math engines are now configurable via the new [‘math\_engine’](options.html#option-math-engine) option.
  + A math engine based on [Ritex](math_engine/ritex.html) for MathML output has been added (requested by Tom Thorogood who
    provided the initial pull request [#169](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/169)).
  + A math engine based on [itex2MML](math_engine/itex2mml.html) for MathML output has been added (requested by Tom Thorogood)
* 2 bug fixes:

  + Fixed [#171](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/171): Hard line wrapping in the GFM parser didn’t work correctly when an inline element
    started a new line (reported by Zach Ahn)
  + Fixed [#173](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/173): The HTML `<button>` element is now recognized as span-level element (pull request
    by Morandat)

  Boehm)

Published on Wednesday, 18 June 2014
## kramdown 1.4.0 released

This release fixes all outstanding bugs, so it is recommended to update. The one new feature is that
the location of the footnotes can now be defined by attaching the reference name “footnotes” to an
ordered or unordered list (like with the table of contents).

One major problem was that unescaped pipe characters `|` often led to involunatary tables. This
release introduces some changes that should prevent this for more cases than before. Additionally,
since this is the most common problem case, it is advised to use `\vert` instead of `|` in inline
math statements. Both do the same in LaTeX but the latter may inadvertently start a table, so better
use the former!

## Changes

* 2 minor changes:

  + Implemented [#106](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/106): Users can now define the location of the footnotes (feature request by Matt
    Neuburg)
  + Merged [#97](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/97): `rake gemspec` now generates a local `kramdown.gemspec` file (pull request by
    Nathanael Jones)
* 9 bug fixes:

  + Fixed [#128](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/128): `<script>` tags are now removed from math statements when converting to HTML
    (reported by Trevor Wennblom)
  + Fixed [#129](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/129): Internal state of custom string scanner class was corrupted due to backtracking
    which led to problems with location tracking (reported by Mark Harrison)
  + Fixed [#112](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/112): The content of `<kbd>`, `<samp>` and `<var>` is now also treated as raw HTML
    (reported by Denis Defreyne)
  + Fixed [#114](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/114): Added missing HTML entity names (reported by Tomer Cohen)
  + Fixed [#101](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/101): Fixed exception on missing alignment information when parsing HTML tables to
    native kramdown elements (initial pull request by zonecheung)
  + Fixed [#117](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/117): The GFM parser now needs a space after a hash so that the line is identified as an
    atx header (reported by Trevo Wennblom)
  + Fixed [#131](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/131): Location tracking in nested list was incorrect (reported by Mark Harrison)
  + Fixed/Worked around [#23](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/23), [#46](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/46), [#107](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/107), [#134](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/134): Parsing math blocks that contain pipe
    characters now works, adjusting inline math statements to use `\vert` instead of `|` resolves
    the other problems (reported by many)
  + Fixed [#135](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/135): Escaped pipes in alternative text of image links were not correctly escaped
    (reported by Philipp Rudloff)

## kramdown 1.3.3 released

This release just fixes a bug with the default HTML document template.

## Changes

* 1 bug fix:

  + The string `charset=` was missing from a `<meta>` tag in the HTML document template.

Published on Sunday, 16 February 2014
## kramdown 1.3.2 released

This release brings some small performance optimizations and the ability to define custom rules for
updating predefined link definitions. The latter is used in [webgen](http://webgen.gettalong.org)
1.2.1 to drastically reduce the time for converting kramdown documents that use a lot of predefined
link definitions.

## Changes

* 2 minor changes:

  + Small (mostly string) performance optimizations
  + New method `Kramdown::Parser::Kramdown#update_link_definitions` method

Published on Sunday, 05 January 2014
## kramdown 1.3.1 released

This release mitigates a performance problem introduced due to the storing of the location
information. On Rubies prior to 2.0 the performance impact was negligible but on Ruby 2.0 and 2.1
performance was much worse.

With the fix the performance is not on prior levels but much better. See the [tests
page](tests.html) which has been updated with current performance graphs.

Also note that for PDF support you now need the newer Prawn versions (i.e. 0.13.x instead of
1.0.0.rc\*)!

## Changes

* 1 minor change:

  + Now depending on the newer Prawn versions, i.e. 0.13.x
* 1 bug fix:

  + Mitigated a performance regression on Ruby 2.0 and Ruby 2.1 (introduced due to the storing of
    the location information)

Published on Sunday, 08 December 2013
## kramdown 1.3.0 released

This release brings a pure Ruby PDF converter for kramdown based on the Prawn library. The PDF
output can be customized by sub-classing the converter or by using a template file that adjusts the
converter object.

## Changes

* 1 major change:

  + A pure Ruby PDF converter based on Prawn is now available
* 7 minor changes:

  + New option ‘auto\_id\_stripping’ can be used to strip HTML and other formatting before converting
    a header text to an ID (fixed [GH#90](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/90) requested by Tuckie)
  + New option ‘hard\_wrap’ for configuring the line break behaviour of the GFM parser ([GH#83](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/83),
    patch by Brandur)
  + Location information (only line numbers) are now available in the :location option on most
    kramdown elements ([GH#96](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/96) patch by Jo Hund)
  + Minitest 5.x is now used for testing.
  + A converter class can now specify whether a template should be applied before, after or before
    and after the conversion.
  + If a file specified with the “template” option is not found and the option starts with
    “string://”, the rest is assumed to be the template.
  + Unknown option keys are now passed through and not removed anymore
* 5 bug fixes:

  + Fixed [GH#77](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/77): Line break inside inline math statement now works correctly (reported by
    memeplex)
  + Fixed problem with line breaks in GFM parser

* 3 documentation fixes:

  + The kramdown website is now hosted at <http://kramdown.gettalong.org> - please update your
    bookmarks!
  + Fixed [GH#80](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/80): Typo in README.md (patch by Luca Barbato)
  + Fixed [GH#81](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/pull/81): Typo in options documentation (patch by Pete Michaud)
* Deprecation notes:

  + Using `.convertername` instead of `.converter_name` is deprecated and will be removed in 2.0
  + The option ‘auto\_id\_stripping’ will be removed in 2.0 because it will be the default.

## kramdown 1.0.0 released

Finally! After four years of development I proudly present you kramdown **1.0.0**!

Naturally, it is recommened to update to this version.

Although the version number now starts with one, the changes from the last release are mostly bug
fixes and some small changes. The biggest change is the **license change**: Until now kramdown was
released under the GPL but starting from 1.0.0 it is released under the **MIT license**!

The MIT license allows the use of kramdown in a commercial setting. However, if you are using
kramdown in a commercial setting, I ask you to contribute back any changes you make for the benefit
of the community and/or to make a donation - thanks in advance!

## Changes

* 4 minor changes

  + New option `transliterated_header_ids` for transliterating header text into ASCII before
    generating a header ID which is useful for language like Vietnamese (fixed [GH#35](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/35), requested by
    Kỳ Anh)
  + The quotation mark entity `&quot;` now gets converted to its character equivalent when
    `entity_output=as_char`.
  + A warning is now output for IALs/ALDs that contain not attribute defintion.
  + HTML footnote output is changed to use `class` instead of `rel` to achieve (X)HTML4/5
    compatibility
* 3 bug fixes

  + Fixed [GH#38](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/38): Encoding problem on 1.9/2.0 due to incompatible encodings – the source string is
    now converted to UTF-8 before parsing and converted back after converting (reported by Simon
    Lydell)
  + Fixed [RF#29647](http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=29647&group_id=7403&atid=28673): Abbreviations with non-word first character at start of text lead to exception
    (reported by Stephan Dale)

  + Fixed bug [GH#30](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/30): Empty body for a definition in a definition list lead to an exception
    (reported by Mark Johnson)

Published on Sunday, 16 September 2012
## kramdown 0.14.0 released

First of all please note that this release contains a **backwards-incompatible** change: The syntax
for specifying a code language for a code block or code span has changed. Instead of using
`lang='CODELANG'` one has to use `.language-CODELANG` now.

This change has been introduced to avoid problems because the `lang="..."` attribute is used by HTML
for other purposes than setting the code language. Furthermore using `.language-CODELANG` is also
proposed by HTML5 and it seems to be a good way to achieve the needed functionality.

Other changes in this release include the possibility of setting the code language on the starting
line of a fenced code block and a way of excluding certain headers from the table of contents by
assigning the `.no_toc` class to them.

## Changes

* 2 major changes

  + Code language is now specified via `.language-CODELANG` instead of `lang='CODELANG'`
  + Implemented support for setting language on fenced code block starting line (initial patch by
    Bran)
* 1 minor change

  + Headers with an ID can be prevented from showing in the TOC by assigning the `.no_toc` class to
    them (patch by Tim Bates)
* 1 bug fix

  + Numeric instead of symbolic HTML entities are now the default fallback (patch by Gioele
    Barabucci)

Published on Friday, 31 August 2012
## kramdown 0.13.8 released

## kramdown 0.13.1 released

The focus of this release was bringing kramdown one step closer to the 1.0 release. The API hasn’t
changed so this is a drop-in replacement for the previous version of kramdown.

If you think that

* kramdown is still missing an important syntax found in another Markdown implementation,
* the API doesn’t feel right,
* or anything else is missing or should be changed for the 1.0 release,

please tell us so by writing to kramdown-users@rubyforge.org!

## Changes

* 3 minor changs:

  + The LaTeX converter now inserts `\hypertarget` commands for all elements that have an ID set.
    The normal link syntax can be used to link to such targets (requested by David Doolin)
  + New option `smart_quotes` for specifying how smart quotes should be output (requested by Michael
    Franzl)
  + Any character except a closing bracket is now valid as link identifier (this makes this part of
    the kramdown syntax compatible to Markdown syntax)
* 10 bug fixes:

  + Fixed error when parsing unknown named entities (reported by David Doolin)
  + Added entity definitions for entities `&ensp;`, `&emsp;` and `&thinsp;` (patch by Damien Pollet)
  + Block HTML line was incorrectly recognized as table line (reported by Piotr Szotkowski)
  + Fixed bug RF#28809: Empty `<a>` tags are were output as self-closed tags (reported by Tim
    Cuthbertson)
  + Fixed bug RF#28785: Name of default template in documentation for `template` option was false
    (reported by Matthew Bennink)
  + Fixed bug RF#28769: span extension in list item wrongly triggered list item IAL parser (reported
    by Yann Esposito)
  + The table row parser has been fixed so that it does not use pipes which appear in `<code>` tags
    as cell separators anymore (like it is done with the native code span syntax)
  + Fixed bug where converting `<em>` and `<strong>` tags to native elements was wrongly done
  + Fixed calculation of cell alignment values when converting HTML tables to native ones, `<col/>`
    tags are now correctly used
  + HTML Tables are now only converted to native tables if all table rows have the same number of
    columns.
* 1 deprecation note:

  + Removed deprecated option `toc_depth` – use the option `toc_levels` instead.

Published on Monday, 01 November 2010
## kramdown 0.12.0 released

Some changes in the last release of kramdown lead to a performance drop. Therefore some performance
optimizations have been done resulting in about 15% less created objects (which reduces the garbage
collection pressure) and quite a performance gain (this version of kramdown is the faster than any
previous version when using Ruby 1.9.2) – see the [tests page](tests.html) for detailed
information.

Aside from the performance optimizations, a Markdown-only parser based on the kramdown parser has
been added

The “internal” API (which is currently everything except the `Kramdown::Document` class) has changed
again and developers may therefore need to update their extensions! The API changes now allow
parsers and converters to be used without a Kramdown::Document class since this class is just
provided for convenience. All the needed information is now stored in the element tree itself.
Information that has no direct representation as an element is stored in the options of the root
element (e.g. abbreviation definitions). More information can be found in the API documentation.

The API should now be relatively stable and once kramdown reaches 1.0.0, the final API will only be
changed in backwards compatible ways.

## Changes

* 1 major change:

  + Added Markdown-only parser
* 6 minor changes:

  + Angle brackets can now also be escaped
  + Pipe characters in code spans that appear in tables do not need to be escaped anymore
  + New option `toc_levels` for specifying the header levels used for the table of contents
    (requested by Rick Frankel, RF#28672)
  + MathJax instead of jsMath is now used for math output in the HTML converter
  + New option `latex_headers` for customizing the header commands for the LaTeX converter
  + Removed parsing of HTML doctype in HTML parser
* 6 bug fixes:

  + Fixed output of paragraphs starting with a right angle bracket in the kramdown converter
  + Invalid span IALs are now left alone and not removed anymore
  + Option `entity_output` is now respected when outputting a non-breaking space for emtpy table
    cells in the HTML converter (reported by Matt Neuburg)
  + Fixed bug where a block IAL before a block HTML element was ignored (reported by Matt Neuburg)
  + Fixed bug where block IALs were falsely applied to nested elements (reported by Matt Neuburg)
  + Fixed bug RF#28660: Converting `<div><br /></div>` from HTML to kramdown resulted in stack trace
    (reported by Garrett Heaver)
* 1 deprecation note:

  + The option `toc_depth` is replaced by the new option `toc_levels` and will be removed in the
    next version.

Published on Friday, 01 October 2010
## kramdown 0.11.0 released

The biggest change in this release is the implementation of the “lazy syntax” which allows one to
not use the correct indent or block marker and still continue a paragraph, blockquote, … The
original Markdown syntax allows this and it was requested that kramdown allows this, too. However,
the main reason for adding this syntax to kramdown is not to encourage authors to be lazy but to
allow kramdown texts to be hard-wrapped by other applications (think, for example, email programs).
Therefore you shouldn’t make active use of this feature when creating a kramdown document!

Another important, though minor, change is that invalid HTML tags and extensions are not removed
anymore. This is done because of the general rule that unrecognized elements are treated as simple
text.

**Note**: The “internal” API (which is currently everything except the `Kramdown::Document` class)
has changed and developers may therefore need to update their extensions!

## Changes

* 3 major changes:

  + Line wrapping a.k.a. “lazy syntax” is now supported (requested by Shawn Van Ittersum)
  + Link URLs in inline links and link definitions may now also contain spaces, even if not enclosed
    in angle brackets (requested by Matt Neuburg)
  + The kramdown converter produces nicer output, using the new option `line_width`
* 9 minor changes:

  + The HTML converter does not escape the quotation mark in code blocks anymore (requested by Matt
    Neuburg)
  + The order of HTML attributes and attributes defined via IALs and ALDs is now preserved
    (requested by Matt Neuburg)
  + Syntax highlighting is now supported in code spans when using the HTML converter (requested by
    Josh Cheek)
  + Updated `nomarkdown` extension and converters to support restricting the output to certain or
    all converters
  + Colons are now allowed in ID names for ALDs and IALs
  + Tables and math blocks now have to start and end on block boundaries
  + The table syntax was relaxed to allow table lines that don’t start with a pipe character (to be
    more compatible with PHP Markdown Extra tables)
  + HTML elements `<b>` and `<i>` are now converted to `<strong>` and `<em>` when using
    HTML-to-native conversion
  + The `document.html` template now uses the text of the first not-nested header as title text
* 9 bug fixes:

  + The LaTeX converter now removes trailing whitespace in footnotes (reported by Michael Franzl)
  + Fixed bug RF#28429: HTML output of `iframe` HTML element was invalid (reported by Matthew Riley)
  + Fixed bug RF#28420: LaTeX converter shouldn’t escape the content of the `nomarkdown` extension
    (reported by Bj Wilson)
  + Fixed bug RF#28469: HTML “document” template did not work (reported by Vofa Ethe)
  + Fixed bug: HTML/kramdown output of `textarea` HTML element was invalid (reported by John Muhl)
  + Invalid or unknown extension tags are now left alone and not removed anymore
  + Invalid HTML tags are now left alone and not removed anymore
  + Fixed a minor problem in list parsing which arised due to compact nested list detection
  + Link/Abbreviation/Footnote definitions as well as extensions, ALDs and block IALs now work
    correctly as block separators
* 1 deprecation note:

  + The option `numeric_entities` has been removed

  + Paragraphs that contain only an image are converted to figures in the LaTeX converter (requested
    by Michael Franzl)
  + Added information to the LaTeX converter documentation on how to change the header types and
    quotation marks

    in the next version
  + The method `Kramdown::Converter::Html#options_for_element` has been removed

Published on Wednesday, 23 June 2010
## kramdown 0.9.0 released

The biggest change in this release is the addition of a kramdown converter. This converter together
with the HTML parser enables one to convert an HTML document into a kramdown document.

Apart from that there are many other small changes and bug fixes, a full list of which you find
below.

## Changes

* Major changes:

  + New *kramdown converter* that converts an element tree into a kramdown document
* Minor changes:

  + Added option `numeric_entities` that defines whether entities are output using their names or
    their numeric values
  + Added option `toc_depth` for specifying how many header levels to include in the table of
    contents (patch by Alex Marandon)
  + Ruby 1.9 only: The HTML converter now always tries to convert entities to their character
    equivalences if possible
  + Change in HTML parser: conversion of `pre` and `code` elements to their native counterpart is
    only done if they contain no entities (under Ruby 1.9 entities are converted to characters
    before this check if possible)
  + The comment extension now produces comment elements that are used by the converters
  + IALs can now also be assigned to definitions (i.e. `dd` elements)
  + Image links may now be specified without alternative text (requested by Rune Myrland, fixes
    RF#28292)
  + The HTML parser gained the ability to convert conforming `span` and `div` elements to `math`
    elements
  + The LaTeX converter now outputs the element attributes as LaTeX comment for some elements
    (blockquotes, lists and math environments; requested by Michael Franzl)
* Bug fixes:

  + Fixed problem with list item IALs: the IAL was not recognized when first element was a code
    block
  + Fixed ri documentation error on gem installation (patch by Alex Marandon)
  + Math content is now correctly escaped when using the HTML converter
  + Fixed html-to-native conversion of tables to only convert conforming tables
* Deprecation notes:

  + The `filter_html` option has been removed.
  + The method `Kramdown::Converter::Html#options_for_element` has been renamed to
    `html_attributes` – using the old name is deprecated and the alias will be removed in the next
    release

Published on Tuesday, 08 June 2010
## kramdown 0.8.0 released

One of the bigger changes in this release is the support for converting HTML tags into native
kramdown elements via the new `html_to_native` option. For example, the HTML tag `p` is converted to
the native paragraph element instead of a generic HTML tag if this option is set to `true`. This is
especially useful for converters that don’t handle generic HTML tags (e.g. the LaTeX converter).

This conversion is a feature of the new standalone HTML parser which is used by the kramdown parser
for parsing HTML tags.

Also note that support for the old extension syntax and custom extensions has been dropped as of
this release! And the `filter_html` option will be removed in the next release because there exist
better facilities for performing this kind of task!

## Changes

* Major changes:

  + New parser for parsing HTML documents
  + Added the option `html_to_native` (default: `false`) which tells the kramdown parser whether to
    convert HTML tags to native kramdown elements or to generic HTML elements.
* Minor changes:

  + Table header cells are now represented by their own element type
  + The element type `:html_text` is not used anymore - it is replaced by the general `:text`
    element
  + HTML comments are now converted to LaTeX comments when using the LaTeX converter
  + The LaTeX converter can now output the contents of HTML `<i>` and `<b>` tags
* Bug fixes:

  + Attributes that have been assigned to the to-be-replaced TOC list are now added correctly on the
    generated TOC list in the HTML converter
  + Fixed problem in typographic symbol processing where an entity string instead of an entity
    element was added
  + Fixed problem with HTML span parsing: some text was not added to the correct element when the
    end tag was not found

## kramdown 0.7.0 released

This release adds syntax support for abbreviations. This means that kramdown is now syntax-wise on
par with Maruku and PHP Markdown Extra!

Another big change is the extension support: After some discussion on the mailing list (many thanks
to Eric Sunshine and Shawn Van Ittersum), the syntax for the extensions has been changed and support
for custom extensions will be dropped in a future release.

Additionally, the option `auto_ids` has been moved from being interpreted by the parser to being
interpreted by the converters. This means that it is not possible anymore to turn automatic header
ID generation on or off for parts of a text.

The HTML and LaTeX converters also gained the ability to generate a table of contents. Just add the
reference name “toc” to an ordered or unordered list and it will be replaced by the ToC (this is
“coincidentally” the same syntax that Maruku uses…).

## Changes

* Major changes:

  + Added support for PHP Markdown Extra like abbreviations
  + Added support for span extensions
  + New syntax for block/span extensions
  + Added support for generating a table of contents in the HTML and LaTeX converters
* Minor changes:

  + The option `auto_ids` has been moved from the parser to the converters.
  + Invalid span IALs are now removed from the output
  + IALs can now be applied to individual list items by placing the IAL directly after the list item
    marker
  + Added an option for prefixing automatically generated IDs with a string
  + Block IALs can now also be put before a block element
* Bug fixes:

  + Fixed a problem with parsing smart quotes at the beginning of a line (reported by Michael
    Franzl)
* Deprecation notes:

  + Removed deprecated CLI option `-f`
  + The old extension syntax and support for custom extensions will be removed in the next release.

## kramdown 0.6.0 released

This release adds syntax support for block and inline LaTeX math (for example: \(e^{i\pi}=?\)).
Aside from that there are the usual small enhancements and bug fixes.

## Changes

* Major changes:

  + Added syntax support for block and inline LaTeX math
* Minor changes:

  + Added a man page for the kramdown binary
  + Added a CLI option for selecting the input format and changed the output format option to `-o`
  + Small syntax change for list items: the last list item text is now also wrapped in a paragraph
    tag if all other list items are.
  + Added documentation on available parsers and converters
* Bug fixes:

  + Fixed problem where clearly invalid email autolinks were permitted (reported by Eric Sunshine)
  + Added documentation for autolinks (reported by Eric Sunshine)
  + Fixed performance problem related to emphasis parsing (reported by Chris Heald)
  + Fixed bug RF#27957: document templates were missing from distribution packages (reported by Alex
    Bargi)
  + Fixed problem with LaTeX converter handling HTML elements not correctly
* Deprecation notes:

  + The CLI options `-f` will be removed in the next release.

## kramdown 0.5.0 released

This release features syntax support for smart quotes in kramdown documents and a new converter for
LaTeX output. The kramdown binary has also been enhanced to support setting any option.

The additional support for the smart quotes makes this release of kramdown a little bit slower than
the previous releases when run under Ruby 1.8. However, a small optimization in the span parser
which is not noticable under Ruby 1.8 gives quite a performance boost under Ruby 1.9 (see the graphs
on the [tests page](tests.html)).

Also note that the internals have been restructured slightly. So if you do more than just using the
basic

```
Kramdown::Document.new(SOURCE, OPTIONS).to_html

```

you may need to adapt your code.

Since the option handling has been revamped, each coderay option must not be set separably!

## Changes

* Major changes:

  + Enhanced the `kramdown` binary (it now supports setting the available options)
  + Added support for ERB templates to wrap the generated output
  + Added syntax support for smart quotes
  + Added a converter for LaTeX output
* Minor changes:

  + Some code restructurations
  + The quotation mark `"` is not converted to `&quot;` in normal text anymore.
* Bug fixes:

  + Fixed problem with multibyte encodings under Ruby 1.9

## kramdown 0.4.0 released

This release features the addition of a [simple table syntax](syntax.html#tables) and [syntax highlighting](converter/html.html#syntax-highlighting) of
code blocks. I think that with these two additions kramdown now supports all the major features
regarding parsing and HTML output that Maruku supports.

Regarding speed: Simple benchmarks using the Markdown README file (can be found inside [this zip
file](http://daringfireball.net/projects/downloads/Markdown_1.0.1.zip)) show that kramdown is currently faster than, for example, the original Markdown.pl, PHP
Markdown, PHP Markdown Extra, Python Markdown and Maruku.

## Changes

* Major changes:

  + Added [syntax](syntax.html#tables) for simple tables
  + Added optional [syntax highlighting](converter/html.html#syntax-highlighting) of code blocks through the CodeRay library
* Minor changes:

  + Changed CSS class name `kramdown-footnotes` to `footnotes` for better compatibility
* Bug fixes:

  + Regular expression for matching escaped characters now works correctly

Published on Sunday, 20 December 2009
## kramdown 0.3.0 released

The HTML block syntax was changed in this release sothat using raw HTML blocks works more naturally
and the rules are easier to remember. This also lead to the creation of a completely new HTML block
parser. Apart from that, there have also been some bug fixes.

Another important change is that kramdown now also runs under Ruby 1.8.5.

## Changes

* Major changes:

  + Added a compatibility fix so that kramdown works under Ruby 1.8.5 (requested by Steve Huff)
  + Complete overhaul of the used block HTML syntax and block HTML parser
  + Using the same semantics for invalid end tags and unclosed tags in the block and span HTML
    parser
* Bug fixes:

  + Fixed warnings on Ruby 1.9
  + Fixed bug in emphasis parser where emphasis started with an underscore at the beginning of a new
    line inside a paragraph was not recognized (reported by Eric Sunshine)
* Deprecation notes:

  + The old extension names `kdoptions` and `nokramdown` have been removed, only the new names
    `options` and `nomarkdown` will work from now on.

Published on Thursday, 03 December 2009
## kramdown 0.2.0 released

The most important changes in this release are the inclusion of a definition list syntax and the
much improved HTML parser. For example, the HTML parser now recognizes the `markdown` attribute for
enabling and disabling syntax processing in an HTML element and it works in many more scenarios.

The kramdown syntax is still a bit in in a state of flux but all of the major syntax elements
(except a syntax for tables) are now available. The following releases will focus on stability and
fixing bugs.

kramdown now also passes 16 from the 23 original Markdown test cases and if one looks at the ones
that fail one can easily see that this is because of the small changes in the syntax (e.g.
converting `---` to `&mdash`). This means that almost all Markdown documents show be correctly
parsed by kramdown!

Last but not least I want to thank Eric Sunshine for his many helpful comments, suggestions and bug
reports!

## Changes

* Major changes:

  + Definition lists are now supported
  + Option `auto_ids` now defaults to `true`
  + kramdown syntax (except HTML block lines) is not processed anymore by default in HTML block tags
  + Added option for enabling/disabling parsing of HTML blocks/spans
  + Added recognition and usage of the “markdown” attribute for HTML block/span tags
  + Renamed extensions `kdoptions` to `options` and `nokramdown` to `nomarkdown` (suggested by Eric
    Sunshine)
  + Added support for setting header IDs via the syntax available in PHP Markdown Extra and Maruku
* Bug fixes:

  + Fixed bug that occured when using `auto_ids=true` and an IAL for assigning an ID to a header
  + Fixed bug with parsing of autolinks (reported by Eric Sunshine)
  + Fixed many bugs regarding HTML parsing – HTML parsing should work much better now (reported by
    Eric Sunshine)
  + Fixed bug with parsing of horizontal rules which contain tabs
* Deprecation notes:

  + The old extension names `kdoptions` and `nokramdown` will be removed in one of the next
    versions, use the new names `options` and `nomarkdown`.

## kramdown 0.1.0 released

This is the first release of kramdown, yet-another-Markdown converter for Ruby, with the following
features:

* Written in pure Ruby, no need to compile an extension (like BlueCloth or rdiscount)
* Fast (current impl ~5x faster than Maruku, ~10x faster than BlueFeather, although ~30x slower than
  native code like rdiscount)
* Strict syntax definition (special cases for which the original Markdown page does not account for
  are explicitly listed and it is shown how kramdown parses them - see the [Syntax](syntax.html) page)
* Supports common Markdown extension (similar to Maruku)

## Description

![@ioquatix](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30030?v=4&size=48)[ioquatix](https://github.com/ioquatix)opened [on May 2, 2020](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/660#issue-611090124)

The following brackets should probably be escaped:

```
Represents an XML Instruction; IE, <? ... ?>

```

e.g.

```
Kramdown::Document.new("Represents an XML Instruction; IE, <? ... ?>").to_html
=> "<p>Represents an XML Instruction; IE, <? ... ?></p>\n"

Kramdown::Document.new("Represents an XML Instruction; IE, `<? ... ?>`").to_html
=> "<p>Represents an XML Instruction; IE, <code>&lt;? ... ?&gt;</code></p>\n"

```

Using backticks is probably the correct approach here, but this documentation/text is coming from a 3rd party so hard to make changes. Maybe this is valid behaviour for Kramdown, if so feel free to close. FYI.

# [kramdown](index.html "Homepage")

## fast, pure-Ruby Markdown-superset converter

* [Home](index.html)
* [Installation](installation.html)
* [Documentation](documentation.html)
* [Quick Reference](quickref.html)
* [Syntax](syntax.html)

**kramdown** (sic, not Kramdown or KramDown, just kramdown) is a *free*
[MIT](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/blob/master/COPYING)-licensed
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) library for parsing and converting a superset of Markdown. It is
completely written in Ruby, supports standard Markdown (with some minor modifications) and various
extensions that have been made popular by the [PHP Markdown Extra](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/) package and [Maruku](http://maruku.rubyforge.org).

It is probably the fastest pure-Ruby Markdown converter available (January 2019), being about 3x
faster than [Maruku](http://maruku.rubyforge.org) and about 6.2x faster than [BlueFeather](http://ruby.morphball.net/bluefeather/index_en.html).

Version **2.5.1** released on
**2024-11-18**, [more news](news.html)

## Overview

If you want to get started with kramdown, have a look at the [installation page](installation.html)
to see how you can install it on your system. Then look through the
[documentation](documentation.html) for finding information about how to actually use kramdown and
its parsers/converters. The [quick reference](quickref.html) provides a overview of the syntax – if
you need a more detailed description of the superset of Markdown which kramdown supports the [syntax
page](syntax.html) is the place to go!

## Bugs, Forums, Mailing Lists

If you have found a bug, you should [report it here](http://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues). Also, there is the [kramdown-users
google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kramdown-users) available if you have any questions!

## Thanks

kramdown would not be possible without the prior work of many other people. I want to thank everyone
involved with making Markdown such a nice markup language and especially the developers of other
Markdown implementations because kramdown borrowed many ideas from existing packages.

# kramdown

## Readme first!

kramdown was originally licensed under the GPL until the 1.0.0 release. However, due to the many
requests it is now released under the MIT license and therefore can easily be used in commercial
projects, too.

However, if you use kramdown in a commercial setting, please consider **contributing back any
changes** for the benefit of the community and/or [**becoming a
sponsor**](https://github.com/sponsors/gettalong/) or [**a
patron**](https://www.patreon.com/gettalong) - thanks!

  development consulting and training services](http://grossweber.com/b/kramdown).

## Introduction

kramdown is a fast, pure Ruby Markdown superset converter, using a strict syntax definition and
supporting several common extensions.

The syntax definition for the kramdown syntax can be found in **doc/syntax.page** (or online at
<http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html>) and a quick reference is available in
**doc/quickref.page** or online at <http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html>.

The kramdown library is mainly written to support the kramdown-to-HTML conversion chain. However,
due to its flexibility (by creating an internal AST) it supports other input and output formats as
well. Here is a list of the supported formats:

* input formats: kramdown (a Markdown superset), Markdown, GFM, HTML
* output formats: HTML, kramdown, LaTeX (and therefore PDF), PDF via Prawn

All the documentation on the available input and output formats is available in the **doc/**
directory and online at <http://kramdown.gettalong.org>.

Starting from version 1.0.0 kramdown is using a versioning scheme with major, minor and patch parts
in the version number where the major number changes on backwards-incompatible changes, the minor
number on the introduction of new features and the patch number on everything else.

For information about changes between versions, have a look at
<http://kramdown.gettalong.org/news.html> or the commit history!

## Usage

kramdown has a very simple API, so using kramdown is as easy as

```
require 'kramdown'

Kramdown::Document.new(text).to_html
```

For detailed information have a look at the API documentation of the `Kramdown::Document` class.

The full API documentation is available at <http://kramdown.gettalong.org/rdoc/>, other sites with an
API documentation for kramdown probably don't provide the complete documentation!

There are also some third-party libraries that extend the functionality of kramdown -- see the
kramdown Wiki at <https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/wiki>.

## Development

Just clone the git repository as described in **doc/installation.page** and you are good to go. You
probably want to install `rake` so that you can use the provided rake tasks.

If you want to run the tests, the development dependencies are needed as well as some additional
programs like `tidy` and `latex`. See the `.travis.yml` file for more information.

1. [Allow more characters in header IDs](/gettalong/kramdown/commit/90954bc4916153d5ad03dc3538b243c48e24a9d1)
    …

   ```
   The current version only allows characters as defined by HTML4. However,
   HTML5 allows any characters to be in an ID. Since allowing any character
   might not play well with the XML syntax of HTML5, extend the allowed
   character set to the full set allowed by XML.

1. [Use instance variable for cache to avoid thread safety issues](/gettalong/kramdown/commit/333f75f7e05f7380a044f12a21f1f4945af1c09a)
    …

   ```
   The DISPATCHER constant represents global state and a thread safety
   issues on Ruby implementations without GIL.

   Removing the dispatcher in favour of direct handling is slower. So the
   best option is to store the dispatcher hash in an instance variable.

   See GH#663 for a detailed discussion.

    …

   ```
   Processing instructions were valid in HTML4 but are not in HTML5.

   So ignore them when parsing a kramdown documenter. There is most
   probably only a negligible amount of documents using processing
   instructions but those WILL GET BROKEN.

   It is sometimes necessary to restrict the options that can be set
   inline, ie. using the {::options ...} extensions.

   By default, the template option is now forbidden to avoid possible
   security problems. This addresses [CVE-2020-14001](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mqm2-cgpr-p4m6 "CVE-2020-14001").

Package        : ruby-kramdown
Version        : 1.12.0-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-14001
Debian Bug     : 965305

ruby-kramdown processes the template option inside Kramdown documents by
default, which allows unintended read access (such as
template="/etc/passwd") or unintended embedded Ruby code execution (such
as a string that begins with template="string://<%= `). NOTE: kramdown is
used in Jekyll, GitLab Pages, GitHub Pages, and Thredded Forum.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
1.12.0-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-kramdown packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-kramdown please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-kramdown>

Package        : ruby-kramdown
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-14001
Debian Bug     : 965305

A flaw was discovered in ruby-kramdown, a fast, pure ruby, Markdown
parser and converter, which could result in unintended read access to
files or unintended embedded Ruby code execution when the {::options /}
extension is used together with the 'template' option.

The Update introduces a new option 'forbidden_inline_options' to
restrict the options allowed with the {::options /} extension. By
default the 'template' option is forbidden.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.17.0-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-kramdown packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-kramdown please refer to its
security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-kramdown>

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
