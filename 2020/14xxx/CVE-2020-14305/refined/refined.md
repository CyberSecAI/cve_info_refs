{
  "CVE-2020-14305": {
    "Root cause": "Lost .data_len definition for Q.931/ipv6 in `nf_conntrack_h323` module.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption vulnerability due to missing length definition when writing data for H.323 connection tracking.",
	    "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "Memory corruption leading to write beyond the end of `struct nf_ct_h323_master`, potentially corrupting adjacent memory regions (like `struct nf_conn_nat` or other slab objects) which can cause system crash/Denial of Service (DoS), and could lead to sensitive information disclosure, or modification of data.",
    "Attack vectors": "Establishing a connection to port 1720 using IPv6 when the `nf_conntrack_h323` kernel module is loaded.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Unauthenticated remote attacker can send a crafted sequence of packets to trigger the vulnerability."
