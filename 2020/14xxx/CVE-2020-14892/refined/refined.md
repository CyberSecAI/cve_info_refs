Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14892:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content from both `oracle.com` and `security.gentoo.org` mentions CVE-2020-14892, confirming its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability is located within the "Core" component of Oracle VM VirtualBox.
   - The `security.gentoo.org` content provides more detail by stating that it is "Multiple vulnerabilities" in VirtualBox and refers to the associated CVEs.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - The vulnerability in Oracle VM VirtualBox core allows privilege escalation.
   - The oracle advisory does not provide specifics but states "Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products." and "Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update."
   - The Gentoo advisory mentions "Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in VirtualBox".

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - An attacker can achieve privilege escalation on the host system. This means an attacker can elevate their privileges gaining root or administrator level access.
   - The `security.gentoo.org` advisory explicitly states that "the worst of which could result in privilege escalation.".
  - The Oracle advisory states "Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit".

**5. Attack Vectors:**
  - The attack vector is local. The vulnerability can be exploited by a user with local access to the system where VirtualBox is installed.
  - The oracle advisory notes, "Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices.".
  - The gentoo security advisory states that the vulnerability is "exploitable: remote".

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - An attacker requires local access to the system where VirtualBox is installed and running.
   - The Gentoo advisory states that the vulnerability is "exploitable: remote" which contradicts the local vector in the Oracle advisory.

**Additional Notes**
*   The Oracle advisory provides a large list of affected products. This CVE is specific to Oracle VM VirtualBox listed in the Oracle Virtualization Risk Matrix.
*   The Gentoo advisory lists affected and unaffected versions of `app-emulation/virtualbox`.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**
CVE-2020-14892 is a vulnerability in the core component of Oracle VM VirtualBox. An attacker can use this vulnerability to perform a local privilege escalation on the system where VirtualBox is installed. Patches are provided by both Oracle and Gentoo to fix this vulnerability.
