Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `setdns` command within the Pi-hole CLI. When `pihole -a setdns` is executed, the provided value is directly placed into an environment variable, which is then sourced. Because the value is not properly sanitized, shell metacharacters within the provided value are interpreted and executed when the environment variable is sourced.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the environment variable, which are then executed when sourced.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `setdns` command does not sanitize the input before using it to set an environment variable, allowing for injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation to Root:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **CLI Access:** The primary attack vector is through the command line interface of Pi-hole using the `pihole -a setdns` command.
- **Sudo privileges:** The attacker needs to be able to run the `pihole` command with `sudo` privileges. The default configuration allowed `www-data` user to run any `pihole` command via `sudo` without password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access/Limited User:** The attacker needs to have some form of access to the system running Pi-hole, where they are able to execute commands via `sudo` as the `www-data` user or a user that is able to run `pihole` commands via `sudo`.
- **Ability to Run `pihole` with `sudo`:**  The attacker needs to be able to execute `pihole` commands using `sudo` privileges (this was possible using the default `www-data` user configuration)

**Additional Details (from the provided content, not in CVE description):**

-   The `setdns` command is vulnerable due to how it handles input by setting the value as an environment variable and then sourcing it.
-   The vulnerability could be triggered by providing a command injection payload such as `1.1.1.1&&bash` or `1.1.1.1&&/tmp/evil.sh` as an argument to `setdns`.
-   The initial vulnerability (CVE-2020-12620) was discovered when trying to append commands to the DNS server IP addresses in `/etc/pihole/dnsserver.conf`.
-   The vulnerability was present in Pi-hole versions prior to 5.1.
-   The exploitation using the `dnsserver.conf` file also exploits this vulnerability in parallel.
