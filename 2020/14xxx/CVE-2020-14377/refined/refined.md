  "CVE-2020-14377": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5. A complete lack of validation of attacker-controlled parameters can lead to a buffer over read. The results of the over read are then written back to the guest virtual machine memory. This vulnerability can be used by an attacker in a virtual machine to read significant amounts of host memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and system availability.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation of attacker-controlled parameters in the `write_back_data` function, specifically `cipher->para.dst_data_len` and `desc->len` which leads to a buffer over-read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker in a virtual machine can read significant amounts of host memory, leading to data confidentiality loss and potential system availability issues. The vulnerability can also be chained with other vulnerabilities to read arbitrary amounts of data from any address in the vhost_crypto process.",
    "attack_vector": "Local. The attack is performed by a malicious guest VM targeting the host system.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control parameters used by `vhost_crypto` and be able to execute code within a guest virtual machine. The attacker requires low privileges within the VM."
