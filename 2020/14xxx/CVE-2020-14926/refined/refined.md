- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Search Term" field of the Module Manager, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS vulnerability. The application's attempt to remove script tags is insufficient to prevent the XSS attack, as it doesn't HTML entity encode reflected output.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
  - Transmitting private data like cookies or other session information to the attacker.
  - Redirecting the victim to attacker-controlled content.
  - Performing malicious operations on the victim's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the "Search Term" field in the Module Manager interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the admin panel of the CMS Made Simple application.
  - The attacker needs to be able to access the Module Manager interface.
