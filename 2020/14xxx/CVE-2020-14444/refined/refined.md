Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-14444

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue within the WSO2 Identity Server product. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it in the output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects user-provided input without proper sanitization. Specifically, this occurs when navigating to the Policy Administration section and attempting to create a new entitlement policy using the XML editor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the user's browser when the affected page is loaded.
- **Redirect to Malicious Websites:** The attacker can redirect the user to a malicious website.
- **UI Manipulation:** The attacker could alter the appearance and behavior of the webpage.
- **Information Retrieval:** The attacker could potentially retrieve sensitive information from the user's browser.
- **Note:** Session hijacking is unlikely because cookies are set with the httpOnly flag.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed by injecting malicious Javascript into the "Write Policy in XML" editor that is accessible from the Policy Administration page of WSO2 Identity Server. The injected code is reflected in the response body when the user views the policy editor page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable application's interface.
- They must be able to create a malicious XSS payload.
- The user must load a webpage that reflects the malicious payload for the exploit to occur.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in WSO2 Identity Server version 5.9.0 and earlier and WSO2 IS as Key Manager 5.9.0 or earlier.
- The vulnerability was reported to the WSO2 security team on Feb 10, 2020.
- A fix is available in the public fix on github.
