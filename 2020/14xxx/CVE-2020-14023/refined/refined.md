Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-14023

**Root Cause:** The Ozeki SMS Gateway software allows Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to insufficient input validation in its "SMS WCF" and "RSS to SMS" modules. These modules allow users to specify URLs that the server will then fetch, leading to SSRF.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-provided URLs before making requests, allowing an attacker to control the server-side requests.
* **Lack of Input Validation:** The "SMS WCF" and "RSS to SMS" modules accept user-supplied URLs without proper checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Network Pivoting:** Attackers can use the vulnerable Ozeki SMS Gateway as a proxy to access internal network resources not directly reachable from the outside.
* **Arbitrary HTTP Requests:** Attackers can send arbitrary HTTP requests to internal or external targets, potentially leading to information disclosure, service disruption, or further exploitation of other vulnerable systems within the network.
* **Abuse of Internal Services:** An attacker could potentially leverage the SSRF to interact with other internal services or APIs that may be vulnerable, such as sending malicious payloads or accessing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Manipulation of SMS WCF and RSS to SMS modules:** An attacker with access to the Ozeki web application administration interface can create or modify "SMS WCF" or "RSS to SMS" links with malicious URLs.
* **Crafted URLs:** The attacker crafts a URL containing the target IP address and port with a malicious payload, which the server will process without proper validation. For example, http://127.0.0.1:9400/sendMessage?recipient=%2B441234567&originator=%2B51810273&senttime=6%2F3%2F2020+12%3A56%3A54+PM&dcs=00&pid=00&msg=testssrf

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Access to Ozeki Web Application Administration Interface:** The attacker needs to have access to the administration interface with rights to create/modify "SMS WCF" or "RSS to SMS" links.
* **Knowledge of Target Network:** The attacker needs to know the internal network structure and target systems to effectively perform the SSRF.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content includes a proof of concept showing how an attacker can exploit the SSRF to send an HTTP request to a local server.
*   The vulnerable versions are 4.17.6 and below, according to the provided Github documentation.
* The vulnerability can be exploited using the "SMS WCF" and "RSS to SMS" modules, as shown in the example screenshots.
