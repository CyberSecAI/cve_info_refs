Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-14324:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is an out-of-band OS command injection flaw within Red Hat CloudForms. It occurs when setting up a conversion host through the Infrastructure Migration Solution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands on the CloudForms server. This is achieved through a specially crafted request during the conversion host setup process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Confidentiality:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data on the CloudForms server.
*   **Data Integrity:** The potential to modify or corrupt data on the system.
*   **System Availability:** The attacker could potentially disrupt the normal operation of the system, leading to denial of service or other availability issues.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute any command they want on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is carried out by sending a malicious network request to the CloudForms server.
*   **Infrastructure Migration Solution:** The vulnerability is present in the conversion host setup process, which is a part of the Infrastructure Migration Solution of CloudForms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the CloudForms system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Malicious Request:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious request that leverages the command injection vulnerability in the conversion host setup.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all active versions of Red Hat CloudForms at the time of discovery.
*   The issue is fixed in CloudForms Management Engine versions 5.11.7.0, 5.11 and 5.10.
*   The vulnerability is considered a high severity issue.
