Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2020-14490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')". The system includes arbitrary local files specified within its parameter and executes some files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path Traversal (CWE-22): The system fails to properly restrict pathnames, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local files through parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this path traversal vulnerability can lead to:
- Disclosure of sensitive files.
- Execution of malicious uploaded files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
- The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L), meaning they need to have some level of access to the system.
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).
- The vulnerability scope is unchanged (S:U) - meaning the vulnerability affects the targeted component only.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have low privileges to the vulnerable system.
- They can exploit the vulnerability over the network.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in OpenClinic GA versions 5.09.02 and 5.89.05b
- The CVSS v3 base score is 8.8 with vector string (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to read or execute files on the server, potentially leading to full compromise.
