Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14968:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the jsrsasign library's failure to properly validate RSA-PSS signatures. Specifically, the library incorrectly accepts signatures with prepended zero bytes as valid, which is a form of signature malleability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **RSA-PSS Signature Malleability:** The core issue is that the `verifyWithMessageHashPSS` function in `rsasign.js` does not reject RSA-PSS signatures that have leading zeros. This allows an attacker to modify a valid signature by prepending zeros without invalidating it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Forged Signatures:** An attacker can potentially craft or modify existing signatures by prepending zero bytes and have them accepted as valid. While the risk of forging a completely new signature is low, the malleability allows for signature manipulation.
*   **Bypass of Authentication/Authorization:** If RSA-PSS signatures are used for authentication or authorization, an attacker could potentially bypass these mechanisms using a manipulated signature

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker could intercept a valid RSA-PSS signature and prepend zeros before forwarding it.
*   **Direct Signature Modification:** An attacker who has access to a valid signature can directly manipulate it by prepending zeros.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to a Valid Signature:** The attacker needs access to a valid RSA-PSS signature.
*   **Ability to Modify Signature:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the signature by prepending zeros.
*   **Target System using jsrsasign:** The target system must be using a vulnerable version of the `jsrsasign` library for RSA-PSS signature validation

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to RSA-PSS signatures and does not affect other signature algorithms.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is considered low due to the low risk of creating a completely new valid signature from scratch, and is more focused on the malleability of existing signatures.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 8.0.17 of the jsrsasign library.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Antonio de la Piedra.
*   The advisory lists the affected versions as 3.0.0 to 8.0.16.
*   NetApp also issued an advisory (NTAP-20200724-0001) which includes CVE-2020-14968 and states that vulnerable Node.js versions through 8.0.18 are affected due to jsrsasign package vulnerability. The advisory listed MAX Data as an affected product and states that there will be no fix released.
