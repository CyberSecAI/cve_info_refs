Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14514:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the nature of Power Line Communications (PLC) used in trailers. The PLC signals, which are transmitted over the trailer's power lines, can be intercepted using active antennas.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Sent Data (CWE-201):** The primary vulnerability is the potential exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the trailer's PLC bus. The lack of encryption or other protective measures means that an attacker can eavesdrop on the communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** The immediate impact is the potential for an attacker to gain access to information transmitted via the PLC bus. The severity of this impact depends on the nature of the data being transmitted.
    *   Examples:
        *   Air weigh systems could expose business intelligence.
        *   Trailer brake controller data could reveal operational parameters.
        *   Telematics systems using PLC could expose network information.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The exposed data could potentially be used for more extensive attacks, depending on the content of the exposed information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Radio Signal Interception:** The vulnerability is exploited by using an active antenna to intercept the PLC signals.
*   **Proximity:** The attack can be carried out from a distance of at least 6 feet, and potentially further depending on environmental conditions and improvements in receiver technology.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within range of the trailer's PLC signal (at least 6 feet).
*   **Equipment:** The attacker needs an active antenna capable of receiving PLC signals.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The attacker does not need any credentials or access to the trailer's systems to perform this attack.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided document is an advisory and the primary goal is to raise awareness of the issue to transportation system sector and manufacturers so that they can consider security while using PLC.
* The document mentions that typical trailer traffic contains minimal information, such as ABS fault messages, and the impact would be less in those cases. But for newer use cases where critical and sensitive data is being transmitted via PLC, it can be severe.
* The document suggests the manufacturers to consider using shorter lengths of PLC buses and reduced transmit voltage to mitigate the issue.
