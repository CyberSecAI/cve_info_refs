Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-14409:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Integer overflow in the `SDL_CalculatePitch` function within `src/video/SDL_surface.c`. This function calculates the scanline width of a surface, and the multiplication of `width` and `SDL_BYTESPERPIXEL(format)` could result in an integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Integer Overflow:  The calculation of the surface pitch, specifically `width * SDL_BYTESPERPIXEL(format)` or `(width * SDL_BITSPERPIXEL(format) + 7) / 8` can overflow, leading to a smaller than expected value for the pitch.
*   Heap Corruption: When an integer overflow occurs, the `pitch` variable can be much smaller than expected. This value is later used to allocate space for the surface. When blitting a surface with the incorrect pitch value, a heap buffer overflow can occur in the `SDL_BlitCopy` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Denial of Service (DoS):  A successful exploit could cause the application to crash due to the heap corruption.
*   Remote Code Execution: In some cases, the heap corruption could be leveraged to execute arbitrary code by a specially crafted BMP file.
*   Application Crash: An attacker could cause the application to crash/DOS.
*   Take Control of the Application: Through heap corruption, it may be possible to take control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Crafted BMP File: The primary attack vector involves using a specially crafted BMP file. The crafted file is designed to trigger the integer overflow in the pitch calculation.
*   File Processing: The vulnerability is triggered when the application processes the malicious BMP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   User Interaction: An attacker needs to be able to get the vulnerable application to load a specially crafted BMP file. This usually requires a user of the application to be tricked into opening such a file.
*   No special privileges are needed.
*   Local: The attack vector is local since the attacker must get the vulnerable application to parse the crafted BMP file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists in `SDL_BlitCopy` and the fix involves changes in `SDL_CalculatePitch` and `SDL_CreateRGBSurfaceWithFormat`.
*   The fix includes checks to prevent integer overflows in pitch calculation by using `Sint64` type to perform pitch calculation.
*   The vulnerability is related to how SDL handles image loading operations.
