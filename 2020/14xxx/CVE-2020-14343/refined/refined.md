  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The fix for CVE-2020-1747 in PyYAML was incomplete. It implemented a blacklist to prevent setting certain properties during deserialization of Python objects, but this blacklist could be bypassed by carefully nesting objects.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete fix for previous vulnerability (CVE-2020-1747)",
      "Arbitrary code execution via `python/object/new` constructor when processing untrusted YAML files with `full_load` or the `FullLoader` loader."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the system by an attacker abusing the `python/object/new` constructor.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing untrusted YAML files using the `full_load` method or the `FullLoader` loader."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted YAML file containing malicious code that utilizes `python/object/new` constructor. The application must use `full_load` or `FullLoader` on the attacker controlled YAML file"
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "mitigation": "Use `yaml.safe_load` or the `SafeLoader` loader when parsing untrusted input.",
    "affected_versions": "The vulnerability is present in versions of PyYAML that include the `FullLoader`, which was introduced in version 5.1.",
    "fix_version": "PyYAML 5.4 includes a fix for this issue.",
    "statement": "Ansible Tower and Engine, and Red Hat Quay are not affected as they use the `safe_load` function.",
        "upstream_opinion": "Upstream discussion on this topic is available at: https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/420#issuecomment-696752389.",
    "pull_request": "The upstream fix is available at: https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/pull/472",
