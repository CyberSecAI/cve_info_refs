This document describes a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting various NETGEAR Orbi WiFi systems.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Pre-authentication command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability, allowing execution of arbitrary commands without authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can potentially execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.
- This could lead to a variety of consequences, including complete compromise of the device, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- The attack can be performed before authentication, meaning no user credentials are required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
- No user authentication is required for exploitation, so no specific access or credentials are required.

**Affected products:** The following NETGEAR products and firmware versions are affected:
- RBK752, RBK753, RBK753S, RBR750, RBS750, RBK842, RBR840, RBS840, RBK852, RBK853, RBR850, RBS850 running firmware versions prior to 3.2.15.25
