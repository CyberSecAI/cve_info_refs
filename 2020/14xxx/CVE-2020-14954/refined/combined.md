STARTTLS is not allowed in the Authenticated state, so previously Mutt would implicitly mark the connection as authenticated and skip any encryption checking/enabling. No credentials are exposed, but it does allow messages to be sent to an attacker, via postpone or fcc'ing for instance.

### Bug Description

Since the update to mutt-1.9.4-3ubuntu0.2 I see certificate errors when sending mail. I use letsencrypt certificates. Initially the cert is accepted, but later on I see different kind of errors on multiple tries to send mail. Before the update, sending mail worked fine. IMAP is still working without any problems.

I get 3 different error messages in a random order:

#####

Warning: Server certificate was signed using an insecure algorithm

Could not negotiate TLS connection

#####

This certificate belongs to:

   Let's Encrypt Authority X3

#####

I'm using

set smtp\_url=smtp://USERNAME@SERVER:587

to configure the outgoing mail.

I cannot permanently accept the certificate for sending, but if i temporary accept it, mail is send ok.

I wonder why there show different messages when trying to send an email? Why does it sometimes show a "Server certificate has been revoked" warning?

If you need additional information, I will try to provide them.

I believe I found the issue, as I was already preparing a new update regarding a new vulnerability that just pop up, I'll soon push a new version address this issue too, and would like to know if you can test it, soon as I push it to security-proposed?

Thanks!

You can reproduce the issue by trying to send an email.

Of cause I can help to test a new version, when it appears in security-proposed.

Yep, I did tested it previously but could not trigger it somehow...anyway

There is already a ~test version with the fix, could you try it please?

With 1.9.4-3ubuntu0.3~test1 mail can be send without the warnings and error messages. This fixes the bug for me.

Do you need any additional testing by my of the packages?

Awesome! I think that covers the regression issue so far. I'll issue a new update soon as possibly addressin it in a proper version number.

Thanks a lot Rolf!!

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1172906#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2020-06-15 06:56:26 UTC  ``` Announced by upstream. No CVEs AFAICS  I've just released version 1.14.3.   Instructions for downloading are  available at <<http://www.mutt.org/download.html>>, or the tarball can be  directly downloaded from <<http://ftp.mutt.org/pub/mutt/>>.   Please take  the time to verify the signature file against my public key.  This is an important security release fixing two issues.  The first is a possible IMAP man-in-the-middle attack.   No credentials  are exposed, but could result in unintended emails being "saved" to an  attacker's server.   The $ssl_starttls quadoption is now used to check  for an unencrypted PREAUTH response from the server.  Thanks very much to Damian Poddebniak and Fabian Ising from the Münster  University of Applied Sciences for reporting this issue, and their help  in testing the fix.  The second fix is for a problem with GnuTLS certificate prompting.  "Rejecting" an expired intermediate cert did not terminate the  connection.   Thanks to @henk on IRC for reporting the issue. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1172906#c1)  Wolfgang Frisch   2020-06-15 15:28:37 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1172935](show_bug.cgi?id=1172935 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2020-14093: mutt,neomutt: IMAP fcc/postpone man-in-the-middle attack via a PREAUTH response") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1172906#c2)  Wolfgang Frisch   2020-06-15 15:29:42 UTC  ``` CVE-2020-14093  Mutt before 1.14.3 allows an IMAP fcc/postpone man-in-the-middle attack via a PREAUTH response. STARTTLS is not allowed in the Authenticated state, so previously Mutt would implicitly mark the connection as authenticated and skip any encryption checking/enabling. No credentials are exposed, but it does allow messages to be sent to an attacker, via postpone or fcc'ing for instance.

Package        : neomutt
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-14093 CVE-2020-14954

Damian Poddebniak and Fabian Ising discovered two security issues in the
STARTTLS handling of the Neomutt mail client, which could enable MITM
attacks.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 20180716+dfsg.1-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your neomutt packages.

For the detailed security status of neomutt please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/neomutt>

Package        : mutt
Version        : 1.5.23-3+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-14093 CVE-2020-14954
Debian Bug     :

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in mutt, a console email client.

CVE-2020-14093

    Mutt allowed an IMAP fcc/postpone man-in-the-middle attack via a
    PREAUTH response.

CVE-2020-14954

    Mutt had a STARTTLS buffering issue that affected IMAP, SMTP, and
    POP3. When a server had sent a "begin TLS" response, the client read
    additional data (e.g., from a man-in-the-middle attacker) and
    evaluated it in a TLS context, aka "response injection."

In Debian jessie, the mutt source package builds two variants of mutt:
mutt and mutt-patched.

The previous package version (1.5.23-3+deb8u2, DLA-2268-1) provided fixes
for the issues referenced above, but they were only applied for the
mutt-patched package build, not for the (vanilla) mutt package build.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
1.5.23-3+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your mutt packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

```
Hello Mutt Users,

I've just released version 1.14.4.  Instructions for downloading are
available at <<http://www.mutt.org/download.html>>, or the tarball can be
directly downloaded from <<http://ftp.mutt.org/pub/mutt/>>.  Please take
the time to verify the signature file against my public key.

This is an important security release fixing a possible
machine-in-the-middle response injection attack when using STARTTLS with
IMAP, POP3, and SMTP.  (For packagers, I've requested a CVE and will
update the website when I have the number).

Thanks again to Damian Poddebniak and Fabian Ising from the Münster
University of Applied Sciences for reporting this issue, including
providing exhaustive tests.

-Kevin

When a server sends a "begin TLS" response, the client reads additional data (e.g., from a man-in-the-middle attacker) and evaluates it in a TLS context, aka "response injection."

## Features

Some of Mutt's features include:

* color support
* message threading
* MIME support (including RFC2047 support for encoded headers)
* PGP/MIME (RFC2015)
* various features to support mailing lists, including list-reply
* active development community
* POP3 support
* IMAP support
* full control of message headers when composing
* support for multiple mailbox formats (mbox, MMDF, MH, maildir)
* **highly** customizable, including keybindings and macros
* change configuration automatically based on recipients, current folder, etc.
* searches using regular expressions, including an internal pattern matching language
* Delivery Status Notification (DSN) support
* postpone message composition indefinetly for later recall
* easily include attachments when composing, even from the command line
* ability to specify alternate addresses for recognition of mail forwarded from other accounts, with ability to set the From: headers on replies/etc. accordingly
* multiple message tagging
* reply to or forward multiple messages at once
* *.mailrc* style configuration files
* easy to install (uses GNU autoconf)
* compiles against either curses/ncurses or S-lang
* translation into at least 20 languages
* small and efficient
* *It's free!* (no cost and GPL'ed)

Though written from scratch, Mutt's initial interface was based largely
on the ELM mail client. To
a large extent, Mutt is still very ELM-like in presentation of
information in menus (and in fact, ELM users will find it quite painless
to switch as the default key bindings are identical). As development
progressed, features found in other popular clients such as PINE and MUSH
have been added, the result being a hybrid, or "mutt." At
present, it most closely resembles the
[SLRN](http://slrn.sourceforge.net/) news client. Mutt was
originally written by
[Michael Elkins](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~me/) but is now
developed and maintained by the members of the Mutt development
[mailing list](mail-lists.html).

### Fix STARTTLS response injection attack.

```

Thanks again to Damian Poddebniak and Fabian Ising from the Münster
University of Applied Sciences for reporting this issue.  Their
summary in ticket 248 states the issue clearly:

  We found another STARTTLS-related issue in Mutt. Unfortunately, it
  affects SMTP, POP3 and IMAP.

  When the server responds with its "let's do TLS now message", e.g. A
  OK begin TLS\r\n in IMAP or +OK begin TLS\r\n in POP3, Mutt will
  also read any data after the \r\n and save it into some internal
  buffer for later processing. This is problematic, because a MITM
  attacker can inject arbitrary responses.

  There is a nice blogpost by Wietse Venema about a "command
  injection" in postfix (<http://www.postfix.org/CVE-2011-0411.html>).
  What we have here is the problem in reverse, i.e. not a command
  injection, but a "response injection."

This commit fixes the issue by clearing the CONNECTION input buffer in
mutt_ssl_starttls().

To make backporting this fix easier, the new functions only clear the
top-level CONNECTION buffer; they don't handle nested buffering in
mutt_zstrm.c or mutt_sasl.c.  However both of those wrap the
connection *after* STARTTLS, so this is currently okay.  mutt_tunnel.c
occurs before connecting, but it does not perform any nesting.
```

Package        : mutt
Version        : 1.5.23-3+deb8u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-14093 CVE-2020-14954
Debian Bug     : 962897

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in mutt, a console email client.

CVE-2020-14093

    Mutt allowed an IMAP fcc/postpone man-in-the-middle attack via a
    PREAUTH response.

CVE-2020-14954

    Mutt had a STARTTLS buffering issue that affected IMAP, SMTP, and
    POP3. When a server had sent a "begin TLS" response, the client read
    additional data (e.g., from a man-in-the-middle attacker) and
    evaluated it in a TLS context, aka "response injection."

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.5.23-3+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your mutt packages.

# Response Injection via STARTTLS in SMTP, POP3 and IMAP

We found another STARTTLS-related issue in Mutt. Unfortunately, it affects SMTP, POP3 and IMAP.

When the server responds with its "let's do TLS now message", e.g. `A OK begin TLS\r\n` in IMAP or `+OK begin TLS\r\n` in POP3, Mutt will also read any data after the `\r\n` and save it into some internal buffer for later processing. This is problematic, because a MITM attacker can inject arbitrary responses. I havn't tested it to this extent, but I highly suspect that this is enough to forge an entire new mailbox in POP3 and IMAP.

There is a nice blogpost by Wietse Venema about a "command injection" in postfix (<http://www.postfix.org/CVE-2011-0411.html>). What we have here is the problem in reverse, i.e. not a command injection, but a "response injection."

May I send you some more config.ron files (with a short explanation) you can use to test this with the server you already used in the PREAUTH issue via email?

Example trace to give an intuition:

```
C: A starttls\r\n
S: A OK begin TLS\r\n
   B OK you are logged in // injected response
<--- TLS --->
C: B login xxx xxx
// here, Mutt interprets the injected response and proceeds with something else
// an attacker can also already inject more responses and (in the worst case) mimic a whole session
C: C select inbox
...
```
