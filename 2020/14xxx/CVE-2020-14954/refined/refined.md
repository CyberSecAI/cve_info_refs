Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-14954:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a STARTTLS buffering issue in Mutt and NeoMutt. After a server sends a "begin TLS" response, the client incorrectly reads and buffers additional data following the response, without properly sanitizing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Response Injection:** A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can inject arbitrary, malicious responses after the "begin TLS" response. The client then processes this injected data as part of the TLS handshake, which is a security bypass.
-   **Improper Input Handling:** The application's failure to clear or validate the input buffer after receiving the "begin TLS" response opens the door for response injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** An attacker positioned between the client and server can inject commands, potentially compromising communication security.
-   **Data Exposure:**  Though not explicitly stated, the injected responses could potentially lead to exfiltration of message content or other sensitive data during the vulnerable handshake period
-   **Message Manipulation:** An attacker may be able to manipulate messages, possibly allowing them to redirect mail, add or remove content.
-   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker may be able to mimic a whole session after the vulnerable handshake by injecting subsequent server commands.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network-based MITM:**  The primary attack vector involves a man-in-the-middle scenario where an attacker intercepts network traffic between the client and the mail server.
-   **Exploitable Protocols:** The vulnerability affects the STARTTLS implementation in IMAP, SMTP, and POP3 protocols.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable client and the mail server.
-   **Timing:** The attacker needs to respond before the legitimate server after the client sends the `STARTTLS` command.
-   **Malicious Server Response:** The attacker needs to be able to forge a valid "begin TLS" response followed by malicious code or crafted data.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided github commit message provides a good summary of the issue.
*   The fix involves clearing the connection's input buffer after receiving the "begin TLS" response to prevent the injection of data into the TLS context.
*   The vulnerability is present in Mutt versions before 1.14.4, and NeoMutt before 2020-06-19.
*   Several vendors have released patches to fix this vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability is related to but distinct from CVE-2020-14093 and CVE-2020-14154.
