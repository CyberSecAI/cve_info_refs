The provided content relates to CVE-2020-14188.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `gajira-create` GitHub action used the lodash template engine to evaluate the `summary` and `description` input values, interpreting the user-supplied input as Javascript code. This was not documented and allowed for double template evaluation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unintended code evaluation: The action was evaluating user-provided input as javascript code through the lodash template engine.
- Lack of input sanitization: There was no sanitization to prevent users from injecting malicious code into the `summary` and `description` fields.
- Undocumented feature: The template syntax was undocumented, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker could execute arbitrary code within the GitHub runner's environment.
- Data exfiltration: Sensitive information like API tokens could be stolen.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious GitHub issue creation: Attackers can craft a malicious payload in the `summary` or `description` of a new GitHub issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create or modify GitHub issues within a repository using the vulnerable GitHub action.
- Ability to inject Javascript code into the `summary` or `description` of the GitHub issues.
