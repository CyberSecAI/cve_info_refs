- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists within the "Knowledgebase" feature of osTicket. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating or editing categories. Specifically, it appears to attempt to block script tags but does not encode the output, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML through attributes like `onload`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Reflected XSS vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization. The application attempts to remove script tags, but does not encode user-supplied input that is later reflected back to the user within the HTML context. This allows an attacker to bypass the script tag filter using HTML event handlers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Transmitting private data (cookies, session information) to the attacker.
    - Redirecting the user to attacker-controlled websites.
    - Performing malicious operations on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by injecting malicious HTML (e.g., `<svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>`) into the "Category Name" or "Category Description" fields when creating or editing a knowledgebase category via the administrative interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be authenticated to the osTicket administrative panel, and must be able to create or modify knowledgebase categories.
