Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14032:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `SmiVariable` driver within the System Management Mode (SMM) of the UEFI firmware. The `SmmGetVariable` function, responsible for reading UEFI variables, does not properly validate the destination buffer address. Specifically, the code doesn't check if the destination buffer resides within the protected SMRAM region.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of validation of the destination buffer address in `SmmGetVariable()`.
- The vulnerability allows for an arbitrary write primitive to SMRAM.
-  The RSI register, which controls the flow, is attacker controlled

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution in SMM (Ring -2).
- Complete control over the system, as SMM has the highest privilege level, allowing access to all physical memory.
- Bypassing of security features like Secure Boot and HVCI.
- Ability to modify kernel or hypervisor data, leading to a compromise of the operating system and hypervisor.
- Potential for persistent malware injection into the SPI flash where UEFI is stored.
- HVCI (Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity) bypass by modifying page table entries (PTE) within the hypervisor.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a software SMI (System Management Interrupt) with a specific number (0xEF in this case) that can be triggered from the OS kernel code by writing to the APMC I/O port.
- The attacker controls the RSI register which is used as a pointer to a buffer that contains parameters for the vulnerable function.
- The attacker also has the ability to set UEFI variables via the Windows API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute code within the kernel mode of the operating system to trigger the SMM interrupt and set the RSI register.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the system's memory layout to construct the necessary data structures for the exploit.
- The attacker needs to be able to set UEFI variables using API's such as `SetFirmwareEnvironmentVariable()`.
