Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-14028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is a path traversal weakness in the "AutoReply script file" name field of the Ozeki SMS Gateway software. This allows an attacker to manipulate the file path, leading to writing/overwriting arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the use of ".." sequences to navigate outside of the intended directory. This is a classic path traversal vulnerability.
*   **Arbitrary File Write/Overwrite:** Because the application doesn't restrict the file path, an attacker can write or overwrite any file the application has permission to modify, including system files if the application runs with high privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Configuration Manipulation:** Attackers can overwrite Ozeki configuration files, leading to:
    *   Changing the admin password.
    *   Altering log or address book locations.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By overwriting Ozeki DLL files, attackers can:
    *   Prevent the Ozeki service from starting or functioning correctly.
    *   Disable advanced functionalities of the software.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In theory, by overwriting DLL files and bypassing bad character restrictions, an attacker may achieve RCE
*   **System Compromise:** If Ozeki is installed on the system drive (typically C:), an attacker could overwrite critical system files and configuration files, leading to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The primary attack vector is the Ozeki SMS Gateway's web application administration interface, specifically the "AutoReply" module.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to the `/userprops` endpoint, using URL-encoded ".." sequences within the `OZFORM_REPLYSCRIPT` parameter.
*   **File Path Manipulation:** The `OZFORM_REPLYSCRIPT` parameter is modified to include path traversal characters allowing the attacker to specify a path outside the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Web Interface:** The attacker must have access to the Ozeki web application's administrative interface.
*   **Privileges to Create AutoReply Scripts:** The attacker needs to have the necessary user privileges to create or modify "AutoReply" scripts.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Ozeki SMS Gateway versions 4.17.6 and below.
*   The exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary file write/overwrite with the privileges of the process, which is often "NT Authority\System" level in Ozeki SMS Gateway.
* The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) showing the crafted HTTP request and its effect.
