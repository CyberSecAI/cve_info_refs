Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14190:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a user-supplied regular expression (regex) within EyeQL (a query language used in Atlassian Fisheye/Crucible) which can lead to a Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The system does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied regex patterns. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious regex that can cause excessive backtracking by the regex engine, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful ReDoS attack can cause the Fisheye/Crucible server to become unresponsive, denying service to legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by injecting a specially crafted regex into the EyeQL query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to submit queries to the Fisheye/Crucible server utilizing EyeQL and provide their own regex patterns within that query. This does not require special privileges or access.
