Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-14359:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Keycloak Gatekeeper was not properly handling HTTP headers, specifically it was susceptible to bypass when lower-case HTTP headers were used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of case sensitivity in HTTP headers by the Keycloak Gatekeeper.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass the Keycloak Gatekeeper, potentially gaining unauthorized access to protected resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- By sending requests with lower-case HTTP headers. Specifically, the vulnerability is exploitable using `curl`, which allows easy control over HTTP header casing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with customized headers.
- The attacker must be able to reach the Keycloak Gatekeeper.
- The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and craft a request with lower-case headers.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability exists in all versions of Keycloak Gatekeeper.
- Some web servers, like Jetty, also accept lower-case headers. This creates a situation where a Keycloak Gatekeeper in front of a Jetty server can be bypassed using lower-case headers.
- The issue was reported by Dhananjay Arunesh.
- The vulnerability was acknowledged by Mathijs Hondshorst and Erwin Rooijakkers (Mediquest).
