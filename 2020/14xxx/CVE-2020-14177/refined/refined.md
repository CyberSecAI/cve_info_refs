- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A regular expression used in JQL version searching is vulnerable to a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the inefficient regular expression used to parse version strings, leading to excessive processing time when provided with specially crafted input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending crafted JQL queries that trigger the vulnerable regular expression. This can impact the application's availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through JQL version searching. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious JQL queries via the application's user interface or APIs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send JQL queries to the vulnerable system. This could be done by a user with access to the application, or in some cases, via public interfaces if the application exposes them.
