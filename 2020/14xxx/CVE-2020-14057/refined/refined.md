Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-14057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the external control of paths used in filesystem operations within Monsta FTP. This means that the application allows user-supplied input to influence the paths used when accessing files, making it possible to read or write files outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **External Control of File Name or Path:** The core weakness is the application's failure to properly sanitize or validate user-controlled input that's used to build file paths. This allows attackers to specify arbitrary file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file on the server that the webserver user has access to. This may expose sensitive information, including database credentials or other configuration files.
*  **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write arbitrary files to the server. This allows for the potential to achieve remote code execution by uploading malicious scripts (e.g., PHP scripts) into a web-accessible directory.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By writing malicious scripts into the web root, an attacker can execute code on the server through the webserver.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the web application itself. The vulnerability can be triggered through HTTP requests to the Monsta FTP application

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker. This means an attacker does not need valid credentials for the Monsta FTP application to perform the exploit.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable Monsta FTP installation.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Monsta FTP versions 2.10.1 and below are affected.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 9.8, which is categorized as "Critical." The vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
*   **Vendor Response:** At the time of the advisory, no vendor fix was available, and users were advised to contact the vendor.
*   **Disclosure Timeline:** The vulnerability was identified on 2019-12-03, with public disclosure (with redacted technical details) on 2020-07-01, after attempts to contact the vendor.
*   **Fix:** The provided content indicates the issue was addressed in version 2.10.2 of the application.
