Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-14061:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

   - The content from github.com_f2084c26_20250119_133029.html, specifically the section titled "Deserialization of untrusted data in Jackson Databind", directly references CVE-2020-14061, its affected versions, and the root cause of the issue.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how FasterXML jackson-databind mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing. This improper handling is related to specific classes within the `oracle.jms` package, namely `AQjmsQueueConnectionFactory`, `AQjmsXATopicConnectionFactory`, `AQjmsTopicConnectionFactory`, `AQjmsXAQueueConnectionFactory`, and `AQjmsXAConnectionFactory`. These are also referred to as `weblogic/oracle-aqjms`.
   - Essentially, if polymorphic type handling is enabled, and a malicious actor supplies JSON containing these gadget classes, it can be exploited to achieve the impact below.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core weakness lies in the insecure deserialization of data from untrusted sources.
   - **Polymorphic Typing:** This vulnerability only exists in scenarios where polymorphic type handling is enabled, specifically when using class names for type identification, which allows an attacker to specify a gadget class. This can be done via `@JsonTypeInfo` or via Default Typing.
   - **Serialization Gadgets:** The vulnerable classes (`AQjms*`) act as “gadgets”. When deserialized, they can be manipulated to perform malicious operations.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** An attacker may be able to gain unauthorized access to confidential data.
   - **Addition or Modification of Data:** An attacker may be able to alter data or add illegitimate data.
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful attack may render the affected system unavailable.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Network:** Exploitation occurs by sending a crafted JSON payload over the network to a system using the vulnerable `jackson-databind` library.
  
**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - The attacker must be able to send arbitrary JSON data to an application that uses the vulnerable `jackson-databind` library with polymorphic type handling enabled.
   - The target application must have a gadget class, which in this case is one from the `oracle.jms` classes, present in its classpath.
   - No specific privileges or user interaction are required for the attack to be successful, other than enabling polymorphic type handling.
   - As mentioned in the medium.com article, a valid user account is needed.

**Additional Technical Details (from Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory):**
- The Oracle documents confirm that this vulnerability is related to jackson-databind and some of the provided CVEs were addressed by the identified patches.
- The patch for CVE-2020-14195 also addresses CVE-2020-14060, CVE-2020-14061 and CVE-2020-14062.
- This vulnerability is addressed in the Oracle Critical Patch Update advisory - July 2021
- This vulnerability is also addressed by the following Oracle products:
  - Oracle Communications Instant Messaging Server
  - Oracle E-Business Suite
  - Oracle Commerce Platform

**Summary of Key Points:**

- CVE-2020-14061 is a deserialization vulnerability in FasterXML jackson-databind, specifically related to the interaction of serialization gadgets and polymorphic typing, especially when related to `oracle.jms` classes.
- Exploitation does not require special privileges or user interaction, only the presence of the vulnerable classes in the classpath and the enablement of polymorphic type handling
- This vulnerability allows for attackers to disclose sensitive information, modify existing data, or conduct denial-of-service attacks by sending maliciously crafted JSON requests.
- The vulnerability affects `jackson-databind` versions before 2.9.10.5 and is fixed in 2.9.10.5 and later.
