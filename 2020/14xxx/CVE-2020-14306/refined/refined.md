Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14306:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the istio-operator's lack of proper namespace validation when deploying the ingress gateway. Specifically, the operator could deploy the ingress gateway to any namespace, regardless of the user's permissions, and it allowed specifying the image deployed as the gateway.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Namespace Validation:** The operator did not properly validate the target namespace for the ingress gateway deployment.
- **Unrestricted Image Specification:** The operator allowed users to specify the gateway image, which could be a malicious one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with basic cluster permissions could exploit this vulnerability to deploy a custom, potentially malicious, gateway/pod into a namespace owned by kube-admin.
- **Access to Privileged Service Account Tokens:** By deploying a pod into a privileged namespace, the attacker could gain access to privileged service account tokens.
- **Data Confidentiality and Integrity Impact:** The vulnerability could lead to a breach of data confidentiality and integrity by allowing access to sensitive data within the cluster.
- **System Availability Impact:** It may also impact system availability through the deployed malicious pod or service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with basic cluster access can exploit the lack of namespace validation.
- The attacker can specify a malicious image to be used for the gateway deployment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs basic cluster permissions, not necessarily administrative privileges.
- The attacker needs the ability to interact with the istio-operator or its configuration.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was present in all versions of `servicemesh-operator` through 1.1.3.
- The fix was implemented in version `servicemesh-operator-1.1.4-3` and was related to the pull request [maistra/istio-operator#462](https://github.com/maistra/istio-operator/pull/462)
- The fix includes a validating webhook to provide early feedback to users on why a namespace can't be used, and a `reconciler.validateManifests` function to ensure that resources are not deployed into namespaces that are not part of the mesh.
- The fix addressed the issue of gateway deployments in arbitrary namespaces. Gateways can be deployed to any namespace by providing a `istio.gateways.some-gateway.namespace: someNamespace` configuration. The fix validates this configuration before deployment.
