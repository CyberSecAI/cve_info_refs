It does not specifically mention CVE-2020-14062, however it explains the general attack vectors and pre-requisites for exploiting jackson through malicious gadgets. Specifically the article notes that a Jackson-based \"gadget\" exploit requires:\n\n1.  Accepts JSON content sent by untrusted client\n2.  Has at least one specific \"gadget\" class to exploit in the Java classpath\n3.  Enable polymorphic type handling for properties with nominal type of `java.lang.Object`\n4.  Use version of Jackson that does not (yet) block “gadget” class in question"
