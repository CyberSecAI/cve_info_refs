Based on the provided content, here's an extraction of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-14364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   An out-of-bounds write in the USB emulation code of QEMU. This occurs when the `USBDevice->setup_len` parameter, which is supposed to determine the length of a USB transfer, exceeds the size of the buffer `USBDevice->data_buf[4096]` during the processing of USB packets. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered within the `do_token_in` and `do_token_out` routines in the USB emulation code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Write:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write. The USB emulation code does not properly check if the `setup_len` value exceeds the buffer size (`data_buf[4096]`), leading to a write outside of the allocated memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Guest-to-Host Code Execution:** A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system with the privileges of the QEMU process. This means a malicious guest OS can escape the virtual environment and run code directly on the hypervisor/host.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability can also be exploited to cause a crash in the QEMU process leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **USB Emulation:** The vulnerability is within the USB emulation code of QEMU.
*   **Processing Malicious USB Packets:** An attacker in the guest OS crafts specific USB packets to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest OS Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code within a guest operating system that is being emulated by QEMU.
*   **Ability to Craft USB Packets:** The attacker needs to craft specific USB packets, manipulating the `setup_len` parameter to exceed the buffer's capacity.
