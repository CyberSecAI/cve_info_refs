Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-14206:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the DiveBook WordPress plugin's log filter functionality. Specifically, arbitrary URL parameters are reflected in the application's response without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin reflects user-supplied input from the URL within the application's response. This allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within a user's browser by crafting a malicious URL.
* The `scrolled` parameter is also vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing cookie-based authentication credentials, leading to session hijacking.
    *   Defacement of the web page.
    *   Redirection of users to malicious websites.
    *   Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the JavaScript payload within a vulnerable parameter (e.g., `foobar`).
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker tricks the victim into clicking the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious JavaScript payload.
*   The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to visit the malicious URL, typically by social engineering.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress instance or have any special privileges.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerable plugin is DiveBook version 1.1.4.
*   The vulnerable parameters mentioned are `filter_diver`, and `scrolled`, and others.
*   The provided example shows the use of `<>script>alert\`XSS+in+arbitrary+URL+parameter\`</script>"<` as a payload to trigger a javascript alert.
