                 CVE-2020-14365 CVE-2021-20228

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Ansible, a configuration
management, deployment and task execution system, which could result in
information disclosure or argument injection. In addition a race
condition in become_user was fixed.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.7+dfsg-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.

For the detailed security status of ansible please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ansible>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

## Description

![@hungluong5791](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11902001?v=4&size=48)[hungluong5791](https://github.com/hungluong5791)opened [on Mar 23, 2020](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68400#issue-586120912)
##### SUMMARY

uri module set string with masked content into content and json output

##### ISSUE TYPE

* Bug Report

##### COMPONENT NAME

uri

##### ANSIBLE VERSION

```
ansible 2.9.0
  config file = None
  configured module search path = ['/Users/hungluong/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /Users/hungluong/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /Users/hungluong/Library/Python/3.7/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.7.6 (default, Dec 30 2019, 19:38:26) [Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.16)]

```
##### CONFIGURATION

```
N/A

```
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT

##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE

```
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  tasks:
    - name: send request
      uri:
        url: "https://postman-echo.com/get?name=something-with-admin"
        user: admin
        password: admin
        method: GET
        force_basic_auth: yes
        return_content: yes
        status_code: 200
      register: response

    - name: extract value
      vars:
        query: args.name
      set_fact:
        value_content: "{{ response.content }}"
        value_content_parsed: "{{ response.content | from_json | json_query(query) }}"
        value_json: "{{ response.json.args.name }}"

    - name: debug
      debug:
        msg:
          - "{{ 'something-with-admin' in value_json }}"
          - "{{ 'something-with-admin' in value_content }}"
          - "{{ 'something-with-admin' in value_content_parsed }}"
          - "{{ 'something-with-********' in value_json }}"
          - "{{ 'something-with-********' in value_content }}"
          - "{{ 'something-with-********' in value_content_parsed }}"
```
##### EXPECTED RESULTS

The module should return the json/content value with the correct values

##### ACTUAL RESULTS

The module seems to apply sensitive info masking ('\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*') to value matching username/password in its output

```
"msg": [
        false,
        false,
        false,
        true,
        false,
        true
    ]

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1856815#c0)  Borja Tarraso    2020-07-14 13:59:10 UTC  ``` In Ansible Engine, when using uri module keys are not properly masked and sensitive data is exposed into content and json output.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1856815#c1)  Borja Tarraso    2020-07-14 13:59:13 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68400>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1856815#c2)  Borja Tarraso    2020-07-14 13:59:16 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  There is no mitigation for this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1856815#c5)  Borja Tarraso    2020-07-15 08:44:53 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Hung Luong   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1856815#c6)  Borja Tarraso    2020-07-15 11:14:44 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1857185](show_bug.cgi?id=1857185 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-14330 ansible: masked keys for uri module are exposed into content and json output [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1857186](show_bug.cgi?id=1857186 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-14330 ansible: masked keys for uri module are exposed into content and json output [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1856815#c8)  Borja Tarraso    2020-07-22 11:03:26 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1859536](show_bug.cgi?id=1859536 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2020-14330 ansible: masked keys for uri module are exposed into content and json output [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1856815#c12)  Borja Tarraso    2020-07-23 07:43:23 UTC  ``` The correct upstream PR which fixes this particular issue is: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/70762/>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1856815#c19)  Borja Tarraso    2020-10-05 15:34:29 UTC  ``` This has been fixed in 2.9.12 upstream and 2.9.13 downstream.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1856815#c21)  Summer Long    2021-01-18 01:27:46 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.9.12 (downstream) and Ansible Engine 2.9.11 (upstream), as well as previous versions are affected by this flaw. Ansible Engine 2.9.12 version (upstream) on towards fixes the issue for upstream and Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.9.13 version is fixed (downstream).  Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 and Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 ships the affected version of Ansible, but they no longer maintain their own version of Ansible. Both the products will consume fixes directly from the Ansible repository. As we still ship Ansible separately for Ceph on Ubuntu, a future update may address this issue.  In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because ansible is not directly customer exposed (so that the flaw could not be exploited) and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP ansible package. Note: Red Hat Open Stack Platform 15 and newer consume fixes directly from the Ansible repository.   ``` |  |
