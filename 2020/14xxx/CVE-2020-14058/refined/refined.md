Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14058:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to the use of a "potentially dangerous function" within Squid when processing TLS certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the TLS handshake process.
- The vulnerability is present in Squid builds that use OpenSSL features.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful attack results in a Denial of Service (DoS).
- The DoS can occur when:
    - A trusted client opens TLS connections with a server for HTTPS.
    - A trusted client opens TLS connections to a server for SSL-Bump intercepted transactions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the processing of TLS certificates during the TLS handshake.
- The attacker needs to establish a TLS connection to the vulnerable Squid instance

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a trusted client able to initiate TLS connections to the Squid proxy.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   Squid 3.1 -> 3.5.28 (when built with OpenSSL)
    *   Squid 4.x -> 4.11 (when built with OpenSSL)
    *   Squid 5.x -> 5.0.2 (when built with OpenSSL)
*   **Fixed Versions:**
    *   Squid 4.12
    *   Squid 5.0.3
*   **Workarounds:**
    *   For interception proxies using SSL-Bump, no workaround is available.
    *   For reverse proxies, using GnuTLS in Squid-4 (if available) may be a solution as it does not use the vulnerable certificate validation helper.
    *   Other installations that relay HTTPS traffic do not need OpenSSL support and can run a build without it.
*   **NetApp Products:** The vulnerability affects NetApp Cloud Manager, which incorporates Squid.
*   **Fedora:** The vulnerability is tracked in Fedora as Bug 1852555. It was fixed in `squid-4.12-1.fc31` and released via `FEDORA-2020-cbebc5617e`.
*   **CVSS Score:** 8.3 (as mentioned in the Squid advisory). The NetApp advisory reports a score of 7.5 (HIGH).
