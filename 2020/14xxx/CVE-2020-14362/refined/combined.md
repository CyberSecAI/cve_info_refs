X Server Pixel Data Uninitialized Memory Information Disclosure
===============================================================

CVE-2020-14347

Allocation for pixmap data in AllocatePixmap() does not initialize the
memory in xserver, it leads to leak uninitialize heap memory to
clients. When the X server runs with elevated privileges.

This flaw can lead to ASLR bypass, which when combined with other
flaws (known/unknown) could lead to lead to privilege elevation in the
client.

Patch
=====

A patch for this issue has been commited to the xorg server git
repository.  xorg-server 1.20.9 will be released shortly and will
include this patch.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [xorg-server](/security/cves?package=xorg-server) - X.Org X11 server

## Details

USN-4488-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in X.Org. This update provides

the corresponding update and also the update from USN-4490-1 for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled the

input extension protocol. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

escalate privileges. ([CVE-2020-14346](/security/CVE-2020-14346))

Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly initialized

memory. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-14347](/security/CVE-2020-14347))

Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled the

XkbSelectEvents function. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

escalate privileges. ([CVE-2020-14361](/security/CVE-2020-14361))

Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled the

XRecordRegisterClients function. A local attacker could possibly use this

issue to escalate privileges. ([CVE-2020-14362](/security/CVE-2020-14362))

Jan-Niklas Sohn discovered that the X.Org X Server incorrectly handled the

XkbSetNames function. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to

escalate privileges. ([CVE-2020-14345](/security/CVE-2020-14345))

# Advisory Details

December 9th, 2020
## X.Org Server XRecordRegisterClients Integer Underflow Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-20-1419ZDI-CAN-11574

| CVE ID | [CVE-2020-14362](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-14362) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [X.Org](https://www.x.org/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Server |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of X.Org Server. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of XRecordRegisterClients requests. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer underflow before writing to memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of root. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | X.Org has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2020-08-05 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2020-12-09 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
