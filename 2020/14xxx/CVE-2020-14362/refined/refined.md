Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-14362:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an integer underflow in the `XRecordRegisterClients` function within the X.Org X Server. This function handles client registration for the X Record extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Integer Underflow:** The primary vulnerability is an integer underflow when processing the size of data to be allocated, which leads to heap-buffer overflow.
-   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate user-supplied data related to the number of clients being registered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate their privileges to root on systems where the X server is running with elevated privileges.
-   **Data Confidentiality, Integrity, and System Availability:** The vulnerability has the potential to compromise data confidentiality and integrity, and can impact system availability

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local. An attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system.
-   **XRecord Extension:** The vulnerability exists within the handling of `XRecordRegisterClients` requests in the X Record extension protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local Code Execution:**  The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability was discovered by Jan-Niklas Sohn working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
-   Patches for this issue were included in xorg-server version 1.20.9 and later.
-   Red Hat rated the impact as moderate for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 because the Xorg server does not run with root privileges by default in RHEL8.
