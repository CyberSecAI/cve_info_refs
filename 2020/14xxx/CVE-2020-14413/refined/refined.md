Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14413:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of the `sanitize()` function within the `inc/libmisc.php` file of NeDI 1.9C. This function is intended to sanitize user-controllable values by escaping potentially harmful characters, specifically the `<SCRIPT>` tag. However, it is easily bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `sanitize()` function fails to properly neutralize or escape malicious user input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
*   **Bypassable Script Tag Filtering:** The function attempts to prevent `<SCRIPT>` tag injection but can be circumvented using alternative methods such as `onerror` event handlers within `IMG` tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation leads to Cross-Site Scripting, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable application.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** Once the XSS is triggered, the attacker could:
    *   Steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Modify the content of the page.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request Parameter Injection:**  The attack is carried out by injecting malicious code into a vulnerable HTTP GET request parameter, specifically the `sta` parameter of `Devices-Config.php`.
*   **Malicious Input Example:** `https://ip/Devices-Config.php?sta="><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>"`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the NeDI 1.9C application.
*   **Basic Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious payload capable of exploiting the identified XSS vulnerability.
*   **No Authentication Requirement to Trigger:** Based on the description, the vulnerability is triggered via a crafted URL, which doesn't inherently require prior authentication, but the description does mention logging into the application as a preliminary step. This could imply that while a user has to login, the vulnerability can still be triggered via a crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The gist notes that *every parameter* displayed and stored is potentially exploitable.
*   The gist links to CVE-2020-14413 which states: "NeDi 1.9C is vulnerable to stored XSS because inc/libmisc.php does not sanitize the hostname parameter. An attacker can inject JavaScript into the hostname field which is later executed on the page when a user views the device details." This confirms the nature of the vulnerability, but the gist provides more details related to the attack vector via the `sta` parameter.
