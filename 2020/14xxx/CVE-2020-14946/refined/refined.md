Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-14946:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization when handling file download requests within the BSA Radar application. Specifically, the application does not validate the `FileName` parameter in the `/UC/downloadFile.ashx` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary file paths into the `FileName` parameter and access local files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI, which allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server's file system.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `FileName` parameter.
- **Insufficient Access Controls:** While authentication is required, the application does not implement sufficient authorization checks to prevent a low-privileged user from exploiting the LFI vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files, including configuration files, source code, or any other file accessible to the web server. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive data and further compromise of the application and system.
- **Potential System Compromise:** By reading sensitive configuration files, attackers could gather valuable information that could be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `/UC/downloadFile.ashx` endpoint with a manipulated `FileName` parameter.
- **Direct Request or Proxy:** The attacker can directly send the request, or utilize a proxy to modify the request to include the malicious file path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account with privileges to access the download functionality.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the path of the vulnerable endpoint (`/UC/downloadFile.ashx`) and the vulnerable parameter (`FileName`).
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft or modify HTTP GET requests.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable Endpoint:** `/UC/downloadFile.ashx`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `FileName`
- **Affected Versions:** BSA Radar version 1.6.7234.24750 and lower

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**
The provided PoC demonstrates how to exploit the LFI vulnerability:
   ```
   VALID REQUEST:
   GET /UC/downloadFile.ashx?ID=XXXX&FileName=SOMEFILE.TXT&UploadStyle=1&UploadStyle=1&UploadSource=6

   LFI EXPLOIT REQUEST:
   GET /UC/downloadFile.ashx?ID=XXXX&FileName=C:\Windows\debug\NetSetup.log&UploadStyle=1&UploadSource=6
   ```

**Remediation:**
- **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation to ensure the `FileName` parameter only allows valid file names within the application’s allowed directory. This should include whitelisting acceptable characters and rejecting any attempts at directory traversal or arbitrary file access.
- **Restrict File Access:** Limit the application’s file system access permissions to only necessary directories and files to prevent access to sensitive system files.
- **Authorization Checks:** Implement more robust authorization checks to ensure that users can only access files that are explicitly permitted based on their user roles or privileges.
- **Parameter Removal:** Remove the exposed parameter or features for low-privileged users that are not required for their user functionality to limit the surface area of the application.
