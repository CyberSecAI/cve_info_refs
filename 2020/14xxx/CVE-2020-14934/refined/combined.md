### Description of defect

**References:**

<https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/tree/release/v4.5>

<https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/tree/release/v4.4>

**File:**

[snmp-engine.c](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/blob/release/v4.5/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-engine.c)

[snmp-message.c](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/blob/release/v4.5/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-message.c)

**Analysis:**

Memory access out of buffer boundaries may occur if an SNMP request with number of OIDs larger than supported by the engine is received and processed.

The OIDs listed in a request are processed by snmp\_message\_decode() function without verification of the varbinds buffer capacity.

The buffer is allocated in .bss as a static variable:

[contiki-ng/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-engine.c](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/blob/23db95746afcaa40df3e742a88fc4877d1ec4dd2/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-engine.c#L208)

Line 208
in
[23db957](/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/commit/23db95746afcaa40df3e742a88fc4877d1ec4dd2)

|  | static snmp\_varbind\_t varbinds[SNMP\_MAX\_NR\_VALUES]; |
| --- | --- |

The varbinds memory buffer is written with the values provided in SNMP request:

[contiki-ng/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-message.c](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/blob/23db95746afcaa40df3e742a88fc4877d1ec4dd2/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-message.c#L245)

Line 245
in
[23db957](/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/commit/23db95746afcaa40df3e742a88fc4877d1ec4dd2)

|  | buf = snmp\_oid\_decode\_oid(buf, &buf\_len, varbinds[i].oid, &oid\_len); |
| --- | --- |

The buffer capacity is determined at compile time by the following definition:

[contiki-ng/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-conf.h](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/blob/23db95746afcaa40df3e742a88fc4877d1ec4dd2/os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-conf.h#L81-L87)

Lines 81 to 87
in
[23db957](/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/commit/23db95746afcaa40df3e742a88fc4877d1ec4dd2)

|  | #define SNMP\_MAX\_NR\_VALUES SNMP\_CONF\_MAX\_NR\_VALUES |
| --- | --- |
|  | #else |
|  | /\*\* |
|  | \* \brief Default maximum number of OIDs in one response |
|  | \*/ |
|  | #define SNMP\_MAX\_NR\_VALUES 2 |
|  | #endif |

If the number of variables in the request exceeds the allocated buffer a memory write out of the buffer boundaries occurs. The write operation beyond the buffer capacity provides possibility to overwrite other variables allocated in the .bss section by the application.

As the sender of the frame is in controll of the content that will be written beyond the buffer limits and there is no strict process memory separation in contiki-ng, this issue may allow overwriting of sensitive memory areas of IoT device.

**Type:**

* Out-of-bounds memory write

**Result:**

* Memory corruption
* Memory write to initialized variables segment with arbitrary data

#### Target(s) affected by this defect ?

* contiki-ng v4.5
* contiki-ng v4.4

#### Fix

Rudimentary fix to address the most critical aspect of the issue:

#### How is this defect reproduced ?

An example hex-encoded SNMP request causing out-of-bounds memory write to varbinds:
