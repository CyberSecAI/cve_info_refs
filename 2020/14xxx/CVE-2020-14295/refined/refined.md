{
  "cveId": "CVE-2020-14295",
  "description": "A SQL injection issue in color.php in Cacti 1.2.12 allows an admin to inject SQL via the filter parameter. This can lead to remote command execution because the product accepts stacked queries.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "Improper input sanitization/validation of the `filter` parameter in the `color.php` file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection",
        "Lack of proper input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote command execution due to the ability to inject SQL and the application allowing stacked queries.",
       "attackVectors": [
        "Network-based attack through the `color.php` endpoint."
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated admin user.",
	  "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability exists because the application constructs a SQL query using unsanitized input from the `filter` parameter. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the query. The application also allows multiple SQL queries to be executed in a single request (stacked queries). This allows an attacker to change settings in the application by injecting a query to modify the `path_php_binary` and calling a host reindex, thereby achieving remote command execution."
