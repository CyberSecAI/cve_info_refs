The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the `dmitry` software.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the `nic_format_buff` function when processing responses from WHOIS servers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow: The `nic_format_buff` function copies data from the WHOIS server response into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without proper bounds checking.
- Unencrypted TCP connections: The software uses unencrypted TCP connections to communicate with WHOIS servers, allowing an attacker to intercept or control the server response.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): As demonstrated in the provided example, a crafted WHOIS response can cause a segmentation fault, crashing the application.
- Remote code execution (RCE): By carefully crafting the malicious response, an attacker may be able to overwrite the return address on the stack and execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by either controlling the WHOIS server or intercepting and modifying the response to a WHOIS query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to control a WHOIS server or intercept network traffic between the victim and the legitimate WHOIS server.
- Knowledge of the software's vulnerable function and the stack structure to craft a malicious payload.

The provided content offers more specific details than the typical CVE description, such as the vulnerable function `nic_format_buff`, the exact attack vector (malicious WHOIS response), and proof-of-concept showing a stack overflow leading to a segmentation fault. It also explicitly states that this vulnerability is different from CVE-2017-7938 due to its remote attack vector.
