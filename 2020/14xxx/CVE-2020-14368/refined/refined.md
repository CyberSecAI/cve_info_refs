{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Theia IDE, when configured with cookies authentication, does not properly set the SameSite attribute for cookies.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to missing SameSite attribute in cookies, which leads to a cross-site WebSocket hijack.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain full access to the victim's workspace through the /services endpoint, leading to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to perform a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack and trick the victim into executing a request via an untrusted link. The malicious link triggers a CSRF and a WebSocket hijack.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be positioned to perform a MITM attack and able to lure the victim into clicking a crafted URL."
