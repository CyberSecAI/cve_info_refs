This flaw allows an attacker to gain full access to the victim's workspace through the /services endpoint. To perform a successful attack, the attacker conducts a Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) and tricks the victim into executing a request via an untrusted link, which performs the CSRF and the Socket hijack.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1823892#c0)  Siddharth Sharma    2020-04-14 18:13:35 UTC  ``` There's an issue with Eclipse Che, impacting on CodeReady Workspaces. When configured with Cookies authentication, Theia IDE doesn't properly set SameSite value allowing CSRF and consequently allowing cross-site websocket hijack on Theia IDE. An attacker may leverage this weakness to gain full-access to the victim's workspace through the /services endpoint. The an attack be successfully performed the attacker needs to perform a MITM and tricks the victim to execute a request via an untrusted link which performs the CSRF and the Socket hijack itself.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1823892#c7)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2020-09-02 04:45:24 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Robin Duda   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1823892#c9)  Marco Benatto    2020-10-05 14:50:35 UTC  ``` There's an issue with Eclipse Che, impacting on CodeReady Workspaces. When configured with Cookies authentication, Theia IDE doesn't properly set SameSite value allowing CSRF and consequently allowing cross-site websocket hijack on Theia IDE.

The an attack be successfully performed the attacker needs to perform a MITM and tricks the victim to execute a request via an untrusted link which performs the CSRF and the Socket hijack itself.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1823892#c11)  Nick Boldt    2020-10-05 17:59:07 UTC  ``` If fixed in <https://github.com/eclipse/che-theia/commit/f9409ac45f977bfb745520f5826c18d41024ebcd> (or any of the commits linked from here from May/June 2020) then the fixversion here should be set to:  Che 7.14 == CRW 2.2 [mappings can be seen here: <https://issues.redhat.com/projects/CRW?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page&status=released-unreleased> ]  Since we're currently on CRW 2.5, with 2.4 released last week, it seems like this issue can be closed.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1823892#c13)  Nick Boldt    2020-12-07 17:03:57 UTC  ``` This issue (for CodeReady Workspaces) was fixed in CRW 2.2 in Aug 2020. See <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CRW-1176>.  I would be surprised if INTLY is still impacted too, as I'd expect they're using our latest 2.5.0 or 2.5.1 release.   ``` |  |
