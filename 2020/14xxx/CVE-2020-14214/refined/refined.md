{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that a new user could register with an unverified email address using a domain of an existing organization, and if the 'shared Organization' and 'domain based assignment' features were active, the unverified user would gain access to all tickets of that organization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Insecure user registration process that allows unverified email addresses",
    "Unrestricted access to organization tickets based on email domain without proper verification."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to an organization's tickets by registering an account with an email address using the organization's domain, without email verification, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the user registration process of the Zammad application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to register a new account on the Zammad system and know a target organization's email domain. No prior access is required."
