  - Content relates to CVE-2020-14311, which is described as an integer overflow in grub_ext2_read_link leading to heap-based buffer overflow.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    - Integer overflow in the `grub_ext2_read_link` function within GRUB2. This overflow occurs when handling symbolic links on ext filesystems with an inode size of `UINT32_MAX`, leading to a zero-sized memory allocation.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Integer overflow vulnerability in the `grub_ext2_read_link` function when dealing with symbolic links in ext filesystems.
    - Heap-based buffer overflow due to the incorrect memory allocation triggered by the integer overflow.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Arbitrary code execution.
    - Circumvention of UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.
    - Potential compromise of system integrity and availability.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local attack vector (as described in bugzilla.redhat.com).
    - An attacker would need to craft a specially crafted ext4 filesystem containing a symlink inode with a size of `UINT32_MAX`.
    - The vulnerability is triggered during the boot process by GRUB2.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Local access to the system with ability to influence the boot process
    - Ability to create a malicious filesystem.
    - High privileges as noted in the SUSE information (bugzilla.suse.com).
    - Ability to write malicious data to a storage device/filesystem that grub uses when booting.

Additional notes:
- The vulnerability is present in GRUB2 versions prior to 2.06.
- The vulnerability was addressed by various vendors with patches and updated packages
- The content mentions other related CVEs that were fixed in the same updates, including CVE-2020-10713, CVE-2020-14308, CVE-2020-14309, CVE-2020-15705, CVE-2020-15706, and CVE-2020-15707.
- This CVE is also related to other vulnerabilities in the GRUB2 bootloader, and is part of a larger coordinated disclosure effort.
- The Google cloud documentation specifies the vulnerability was fixed in Container-Optimized OS (COS) milestone 81, specifically the `cos-81-12871-1185-0` release.
