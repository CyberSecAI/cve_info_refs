Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaw in Ansible Tower.
- The application allows an attacker to supply or modify URLs that the server will then process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The application does not properly validate user-supplied URLs, allowing the server to make requests to arbitrary locations.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize/validate the URLs provided in webhooks configurations.
- **Information Disclosure**: The system is returning full error details, including HTML source (in the case of HTTP/HTTPS errors), server unavailable messages and port status, potentially exposing sensitive information about the internal network.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can use the SSRF vulnerability to connect to internal services that are not intended to be exposed to external users.
- This can lead to data confidentiality issues, as sensitive information might be exposed if the targeted internal service returns such data.
- Attacker could also potentially perform POST requests towards internal services.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in the webhooks functionality of Ansible Tower.
- An attacker can exploit it by supplying a crafted URL during the configuration of a webhook (HTTP, mail, etc.).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to manage webhooks as an organization administrator within Ansible Tower.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Ansible Tower versions 3.7.1 and prior.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in Ansible Tower version 3.7.2.
- The fix has been released in RHSA-2020:3328.
- The vulnerability was reported by Maxime ESCOURBIAC of the Michelin CERT team.
