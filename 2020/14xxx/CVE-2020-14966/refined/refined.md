```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The jsrsasign library's ECDSA signature validation did not properly check the ASN.1 DER encoding of the signature, allowing for malleability. It failed to reject signatures with incorrect encodings like multi-byte lengths, prepended zeros, and appended zeros.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of ASN.1 DER encoded ECDSA signatures",
      "Acceptance of signatures with non-DER encodings like BER"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploitation could lead to accepting a forged or crafted message as being signed by a valid key. This could allow for bypassing security mechanisms that rely on proper signature verification.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can craft a modified ECDSA signature that differs from the original but is still accepted as valid by the vulnerable jsrsasign library.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create an ECDSA signature (using a valid key or not). The attacker can then modify the encoding of the signature, to cause the vulnerability.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability arises because the library does not strictly enforce DER encoding rules for ASN.1, instead accepting malformed signatures that should have been rejected. The vulnerability exists within the ECDSA signature validation and can be triggered when validating a signature against a message."
