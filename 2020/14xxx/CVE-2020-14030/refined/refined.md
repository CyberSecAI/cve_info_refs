Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-14030:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content from `github.com_15bf0222_20250119_114114.html` directly references "CVE-2020-14030" and describes a vulnerability in "Ozeki SMS Gateway" involving .NET deserialization. This aligns with the CVE description, which would likely point to a vulnerability involving the same.
   - The content from `github.com_c006cb87_20250119_132938.html` describes ysoserial.net, a tool used to generate payloads for exploiting .NET deserialization vulnerabilities.
   - The content from `www.ozeki.hu_c8c18d25_20250119_114114.html` is the official download page for Ozeki software, including the vulnerable Ozeki SMS Gateway.

**2. Root Cause:**
   - The vulnerability stems from the unsafe deserialization of .NET objects in the Ozeki SMS Gateway application. Specifically, the software stores SMS messages in .NET serialized format on the filesystem and deserializes these files to display them in the web interface.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Unsafe Deserialization:** The core weakness is the application's failure to properly validate or sanitize serialized data before deserializing it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious payloads.
   - **Path Traversal:** The "Move SMS Folder" functionality is vulnerable to path traversal, which is exploited to point the application to the malicious files located outside the user's SMS boxes. This flaw enables the attacker to trigger the deserialization of arbitrary files.
   - **Lack of Input Validation:** The application doesn't validate the 'messageid' parameter passed to "Move SMS Folder" allowing the path traversal.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a malicious .NET serialized payload, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the Ozeki SMS Gateway. This allows for full system compromise.
   - **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can potentially exfiltrate sensitive information stored on the server.
   - **System Tampering:** Attackers could modify or destroy data, disrupt services, or install backdoors.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious .NET serialized file to the server via the "Import Contacts" or Voice SMS Attachment functionality.
   - **Path Traversal Exploit:** An attacker then crafts a request to the "Move SMS Folder" functionality to point to the uploaded malicious file using path traversal techniques.
   - **Triggering Deserialization:** The Ozeki application reads the file and unsafely deserializes it, resulting in arbitrary code execution.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Web Application Access:** The attacker needs access to the Ozeki Web Application administration interface with "admin" credentials to be able to upload the serialized file and trigger the vulnerable endpoint.
   - **Understanding of .NET Deserialization:** The attacker needs to be familiar with .NET deserialization vulnerabilities and tools like `ysoserial.net` to generate the exploit payloads.

**Additional Details:**
   - The provided content includes a specific `ysoserial.exe` command that generates a payload to execute `whoami > C:\Windows\Temp\Deserialization.txt` demonstrating the impact of the vulnerability.
   - The content demonstrates how the vulnerable application reads the files from the filesystem and deserializes the content to display it on the web interface, exposing the unsafe deserialization vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2020-14030 is a critical vulnerability that allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution on a system running the vulnerable version of the Ozeki SMS Gateway application. This is achieved through a combination of malicious file upload, path traversal, and unsafe .NET deserialization.
