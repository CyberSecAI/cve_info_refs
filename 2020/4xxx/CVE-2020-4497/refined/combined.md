# Security Bulletin: IBM Spectrum Protect Plus vulnerability discloses sensitive information due to unencrypted data in transit (CVE-2020-4497)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM Spectrum Protect Plus does not encrypt data transfer between vSnap servers and application agents. This could allow an attacker to view senstive information in transit.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2020-4497](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-4497)

## Affected Products and Versions

| **Affected Product(s)** | **Version(s)** |
| --- | --- |
| IBM Spectrum Protect Plus | 10.1.0-10.1.12 |

## Remediation/Fixes

IBM Spectrum Protect Plus 10.1.13 introduces Transport Encryption feature. With transport encryption, you can protect the data transport between application host and vSnap during backup and restore. Transport encryption feature ensures security to each data path of data between the application host and the vSnap by encrypting and decrypting the data. For more information about Transport Encryption, see <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSNQFQ_10.1.13/spp/r_spp_vSnap_transportencryption.html>

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
