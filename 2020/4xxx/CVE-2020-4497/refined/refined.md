- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the lack of encryption of data transfer between vSnap servers and application agents within IBM Spectrum Protect Plus.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unencrypted data transmission exposes sensitive information to potential eavesdropping during transit.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could intercept and view sensitive information transmitted between vSnap servers and application agents.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves intercepting network traffic between vSnap servers and application agents.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to monitor or intercept network communications between the vulnerable components.
