# Security Bulletin: A vulnerability has been identified in IBM Spectrum Scale where an unauthorized user can send arbitrary data to the CLI commands and daemon (CVE-2020-4926)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A security vulnerability has been identified in all levels of IBM Spectrum Scale where an unauthorized user can send arbitrary data to the CLI commands and daemon. A fix for this vulnerability is available.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2020-4926](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-4926)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| IBM Spectrum Scale | ALL |

## Remediation/Fixes

For IBM Spectrum Scale levels lower than V5.1.3, apply V5.1.3 or later available from FixCentral at:

<https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Software%20defined%20storage&product=ibm/StorageSoftware/IBM+Spectrum+Scale&release=5.1.3&platform=All&function=all>

In addition to applying the recommended code level, ensure that the **tscCmdAllowRemoteConnections** configuration parameter is set to ‘no’, which requires a cluster minimum release level of 5.1.3 or later. Setting **tscCmdAllowRemoteConnections** to ‘no’ in a multi-cluster setting must be done after ensuring that the remote clusters are running Spectrum Scale v5.1.3 or later

See *<<mmchconfig command>>* for more details - <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-scale/5.1.3?topic=reference-mmchconfig-command>

**Note :** Systems running supported version should be upgraded to the current release containing the security fixes.
