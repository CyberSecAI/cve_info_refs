- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site scripting vulnerability in IBM Maximo Asset Management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can potentially execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser, leading to session hijacking, information disclosure, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through unspecified means in the application, where user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into a vulnerable part of the application that is then rendered to the user's browser.
