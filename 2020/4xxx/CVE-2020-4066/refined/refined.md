Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4066:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `trainBatch` function in the `limdu` npm package is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The `trainBatch` function, when used with certain classifiers, executes shell commands with user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server running the affected application, potentially leading to full system compromise. This includes data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
-  By providing malicious input to the `trainBatch` function in the application using `limdu` package. The vulnerable code exists within the `limdu` library and the applications using the library will be vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to influence the input to the `trainBatch` function. This is likely achievable if the application using the library exposes the training functionality to user input.

**Additional details from the content:**
- Affected package: `limdu` npm package.
- Affected versions: `<= 0.94`
- Patched version: `0.95`
- Workaround: Avoid using `trainBatch` with classifiers that rely on shell execution, like SVM Perf, SVM Linear, or Adaboost.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID: CVE-2020-4066
