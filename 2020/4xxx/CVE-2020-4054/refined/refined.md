{
  "CVE-2020-4054": {
    "Description": "When HTML is sanitized using Sanitize's \"relaxed\" config or a custom config that allows certain elements, some content in a `<math>` or `<svg>` element may not be sanitized correctly even if `math` and `svg` are not in the allowlist.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from how Sanitize handles `<math>` and `<svg>` elements. These elements do not follow the same parsing rules as other HTML elements, leading to improper sanitization of their content when these elements are not explicitly allowed but are present in the input.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of special HTML elements (`<math>` and `<svg>`) leading to a bypass of sanitization rules."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML through Sanitize, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or other undesirable behavior when the unsanitized HTML is rendered in a browser.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting malicious HTML input containing `<math>` or `<svg>` elements with embedded malicious content, an attacker can bypass the sanitization rules.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide malicious HTML input that is processed by the vulnerable Sanitize library. This can often happen through user-submitted content on a web application."
