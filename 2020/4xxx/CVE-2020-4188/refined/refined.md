Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-4188

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is described as a "Use of Insufficiently Random Value". This indicates that the IBM Security Guardium product uses a method of generating random values that are not sufficiently unpredictable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the lack of strong randomness in the generated values. This could be due to:
    - Using a weak algorithm for generating random numbers.
    - Using a predictable seed value to initialize the random number generator.
    - Not using a sufficient amount of entropy when creating random data.

**Impact of Exploitation:** The specific impact isn't detailed, however, insufficient randomness can have a wide range of impacts, depending on how the values are used. Generally, predictable or guessable values can weaken security by:
  - Allowing attackers to predict session IDs
  - Allowing attackers to bypass authentication or authorization mechanisms.
  - Making cryptographic keys predictable or guessable.
  - Potentially leading to information disclosure or unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector would depend on the specific application of the insufficiently random value, but generally could include:
   - Network attacks: where an attacker observes traffic to infer patterns in the generated values.
   - Direct interaction with the affected system: an attacker may try to predict values based on previous interactions.
   - Manipulation of the system time could influence the sequence of random numbers produced.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to:
    - Observe or interact with the system where the random values are used.
    - Have knowledge of how the random values are generated, to exploit the weakness. The level of attacker capabilities varies depending on the exploitation method.
    - In some scenarios, the attacker may need to be on the same network, in others, remote access may suffice.
