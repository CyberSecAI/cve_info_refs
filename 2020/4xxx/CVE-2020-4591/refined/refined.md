- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Spectrum Protect Server does not encrypt the second chunk of an object in an encrypted container pool.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to lack of encryption for the second chunk of an object.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is within the server's handling of encrypted container pools; the specific attack vector for exploiting this is not specified.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would likely need to have some level of access to the storage or network where the unencrypted data is being transmitted or stored. Specific attacker capabilities are not listed.
