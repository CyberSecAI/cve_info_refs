- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a missing HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header on pages where users are not authenticated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing HSTS header. This can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks where a malicious actor can intercept and modify communication between the user and the server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack could allow a malicious actor to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially leading to data exposure, session hijacking, or other malicious activities. 
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through network traffic interception. An attacker could intercept communication between a user and the server, especially on networks where the user is not directly in control (e.g., public Wi-Fi).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the affected server. This could be achieved through a man-in-the-middle attack on a shared network.
