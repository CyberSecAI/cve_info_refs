- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the WASReqURL cookie, leading to potential exposure of sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of secure flags for the `WASReqURL` cookie and `httpSession` which allows the cookie to be transmitted over unencrypted channels, potentially leading to information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially intercept the `WASReqURL` cookie if it's transmitted over an insecure channel, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves intercepting network traffic where the vulnerable cookie is transmitted. This could occur through a man-in-the-middle attack on an insecure network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the client and the vulnerable IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale Liberty Deployment server. This could involve being on the same network or having compromised a network device in between.
