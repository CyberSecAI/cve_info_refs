- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Spectrum Scale GUI utilizes a weak cryptographic algorithm.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of a weak cryptographic algorithm.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The bulletin does not specify the exact impact, but it implies potential compromise of the GUI's security due to the weak crypto.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly mentioned, but it is likely a network-based attack targeting the GUI component of IBM Spectrum Scale.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The bulletin does not detail attacker capabilities, but it can be inferred they would need network access to the affected GUI component.
