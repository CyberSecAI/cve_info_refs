- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The cookies set by the IBM Security Identity Governance and Intelligence application are missing the SameSite attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing SameSite attribute in cookies
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The absence of the `SameSite` attribute can lead to potential security risks related to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, as it affects how browsers handle cookies during cross-site requests.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially exploit the lack of the SameSite attribute by crafting malicious web pages or links that initiate unauthorized requests to the vulnerable application while the user is authenticated.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker would need to be able to induce a user of the affected application to visit a malicious web page or click on a malicious link and be authenticated to the application.
