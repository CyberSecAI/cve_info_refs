{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2020-4272",
    "Root cause": "The QRadar Forensics web application is vulnerable to instantiation of arbitrary objects based on user-supplied input. Additionally, the same input is used to include PHP files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unvalidated user-supplied input leading to arbitrary object instantiation.",
      "Local file inclusion due to lack of sanitization of user-provided file paths.",
         "Lack of input validation on the class name and file paths used in the graph rendering functionality."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can perform various attacks, including Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and arbitrary code execution. By uploading a malicious PHP file and using the local file inclusion vulnerability, the attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code with the privileges of the Apache user (typically the 'nobody' user).",
    "Attack vectors": [
       "Manipulating the `chart` and `dataset` parameters in HTTP requests to the `graphs.php` file.",
      "Uploading a malicious PHP file using the case upload functionality.",
        "Utilizing the local file inclusion vulnerability to execute the uploaded PHP file."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable QRadar Forensics web application. They also need to be able to upload files via the case upload functionality."
