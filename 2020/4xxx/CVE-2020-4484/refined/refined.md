Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Generic process properties are not treated as secure when a process is executed through a "Run Generic Process" step in IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD). This indicates that sensitive data might be exposed or improperly handled when passed through this specific step.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Handling of Process Properties:** The core issue is the lack of secure handling of generic process properties when used with the "Run Generic Process" step. This suggests that these properties, which might contain sensitive information, are not being encrypted, masked, or otherwise protected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** The primary impact is the potential exposure of sensitive data contained within the process properties. This could include credentials, API keys, or other confidential information.
- **Potential for Unauthorized Access or Actions:** Depending on the nature of the exposed properties, an attacker might be able to gain unauthorized access to systems or perform unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Exploitation Through "Run Generic Process" Step:** An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by crafting or manipulating processes that utilize the "Run Generic Process" step with malicious or specially crafted properties.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to UCD:** The attacker needs to have some level of access to the IBM UrbanCode Deploy system to create, modify or trigger processes that use the vulnerable "Run Generic Process" step.
- **Knowledge of Process Properties:** An attacker would need some understanding of the UCD processes and the specific use of properties to leverage this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability affects a wide range of UCD versions, including all versions prior to the patched releases.
-   The fix involves upgrading to specific versions of the product, which suggests a change in how process properties are handled.
-   There are no suggested workarounds or mitigations other than upgrading, indicating a serious flaw.
