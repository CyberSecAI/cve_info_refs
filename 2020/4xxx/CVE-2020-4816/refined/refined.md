- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the potential for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is described as a sensitive information exposure issue, which arises from the possibility of using MITM techniques.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could obtain sensitive information by intercepting communication through man-in-the-middle techniques.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a remote attack via man-in-the-middle techniques.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned in the network to intercept communications between the client and the server.
