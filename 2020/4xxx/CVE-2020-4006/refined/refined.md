Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-4006

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a command injection flaw present in the administrative configurator of VMware Workspace ONE Access, Access Connector, Identity Manager, and Identity Manager Connector.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The administrative configurator fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Command Execution: A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with unrestricted (root) privileges. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the administrative configurator, which typically runs on port 8443.
- Valid Credentials: The attacker must have valid administrator credentials for the configurator admin account. This password is set during the initial deployment of the affected products.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access to the administrative interface (port 8443).
- Valid administrative credentials for the configurator admin account.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is actively exploited in the wild.
- The vulnerability is present in Linux installations but not in the Windows connector components.
-  Mitre ATT&CK technique T1586 (Compromise Accounts) is referenced as a possible means of obtaining the necessary credentials for exploitation
-  VMware has released patches and workarounds to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 base score of 7.2
