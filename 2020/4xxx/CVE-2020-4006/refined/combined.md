## VMware Workspace ONE Access and related components are vulnerable to command injection

#### Vulnerability Note VU#724367

Original Release Date: 2020-11-23 | Last Revised: 2020-12-08

---

### Overview

VMware [Workspace One Access](https://www.vmware.com/products/workspace-one.html), Access Connector, Identity Manager, and Identity Manager Connector are vulnerable to command injection in the administrative configurator. This could allow a remote attacker to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system.

### Description

VMware [Workspace One Access](https://www.vmware.com/products/workspace-one.html), Access Connector, Identity Manager, and Identity Manager Connector are vulnerable to command injection in the administrative configurator. This could allow a remote attacker with access to the administrative configurator on port 8443 and a valid password to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system. For additional details, please see [VMSA-2020-0027](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0027.html) and [CVE-2020-4006](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4006).

### Impact

This could allow a malicious actor with network access to the administrative configurator on port 8443 and a valid password for the configurator admin account to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system.

# Compromise Accounts

##### Sub-techniques (3)

| ID | Name |
| --- | --- |
| [T1586.001](/techniques/T1586/001/) | [Social Media Accounts](/techniques/T1586/001/) |
| [T1586.002](/techniques/T1586/002/) | [Email Accounts](/techniques/T1586/002/) |
| [T1586.003](/techniques/T1586/003/) | [Cloud Accounts](/techniques/T1586/003/) |

Adversaries may compromise accounts with services that can be used during targeting. For operations incorporating social engineering, the utilization of an online persona may be important. Rather than creating and cultivating accounts (i.e. [Establish Accounts](/techniques/T1585)), adversaries may compromise existing accounts. Utilizing an existing persona may engender a level of trust in a potential victim if they have a relationship, or knowledge of, the compromised persona.

A variety of methods exist for compromising accounts, such as gathering credentials via [Phishing for Information](/techniques/T1598), purchasing credentials from third-party sites, brute forcing credentials (ex: password reuse from breach credential dumps), or paying employees, suppliers or business partners for access to credentials.[[1]](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/02/anonymous-speaks-the-inside-story-of-the-hbgary-hack/)[[2]](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/03/22/dev-0537-criminal-actor-targeting-organizations-for-data-exfiltration-and-destruction/) Prior to compromising accounts, adversaries may conduct Reconnaissance to inform decisions about which accounts to compromise to further their operation.

Personas may exist on a single site or across multiple sites (ex: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, etc.). Compromised accounts may require additional development, this could include filling out or modifying profile information, further developing social networks, or incorporating photos.

Adversaries may directly leverage compromised email accounts for [Phishing for Information](/techniques/T1598) or [Phishing](/techniques/T1566).

## Mitigations

| ID | Mitigation | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [M1056](/mitigations/M1056) | [Pre-compromise](/mitigations/M1056) | This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. |

## Detection

| ID | Data Source | Data Component | Detects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [DS0029](/datasources/DS0029) | [Network Traffic](/datasources/DS0029) | [Network Traffic Content](/datasources/DS0029/#Network%20Traffic%20Content) | Monitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)). |
| [DS0021](/datasources/DS0021) | [Persona](/datasources/DS0021) | [Social Media](/datasources/DS0021/#Social%20Media) | Consider monitoring social media activity related to your organization. Suspicious activity may include personas claiming to work for your organization or recently modified accounts making numerous connection requests to accounts affiliated with your organization.Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access (ex: [Phishing](/techniques/T1566)). |

##### **2. Introduction**

A command injection vulnerability was privately reported to VMware. Workarounds are available to address this vulnerability in affected VMware products.

##### **3a. Command Injection Vulnerability in VMware Workspace One Access, Access Connector, Identity Manager, and Identity Manager Connector administrative configurator (CVE-2020-4006)**

**Description**

VMware Workspace One Access, Access Connector, Identity Manager, and Identity Manager Connector contain a Command Injection Vulnerability in the administrative configurator. VMware has evaluated this issue to be of '[Important](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html)' severity with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [7.2](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Known Attack Vectors**

A malicious actor with network access to the administrative configurator on port 8443 and a valid password for the configurator admin account can execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system. This account is internal to the impacted products and a password is set at the time of deployment. A malicious actor must possess this password to attempt to exploit CVE-2020-4006. Examples of how this password could be obtained by a malicious actor are documented in [T1586](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586/) of the MITRE ATT&CK database.

**Resolution**

Fixes for CVE-2020-4006 are documented in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' below.

**Workarounds**

Workarounds for CVE-2020-4006 have been listed in the 'Workarounds' column of the 'Response Matrix' below.

**Additional Documentation**

None.

**Acknowledgements**

VMware would like to thank the National Security Agency for reporting this vulnerability to us.

**Notes**

[1] These product suites deploy affected components listed in table 3a. Fixes from KB81754 or Workarounds from KB81731 should be applied directly to affected components that these product suites have deployed following the same instructions.

[2] The severity and CVSS scoring for CVE-2020-4006 has been updated to reflect that a malicious actor must posses valid credentials for the configurator admin account in order to attempt exploitation of CVE-2020-4006.
