### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Multiple vulnerabilities were reported to exist in IBM Data Risk Manager (IDRM) V2.0.1 and greater. Two issues were already fixed in V2.0.4.1, and the rest are fixed in V2.0.6.2 and later.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2020-4427](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-4427)

## Affected Products and Versions

| *Product* | *Issue* | *Versions* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IBM Data Risk Manager | Authentication Bypass | 2.0.6.1 and earlier |
| IBM Data Risk Manager | Command Injection | 2.0.4 and earlier |
| IBM Data Risk Manager | Default Password | 2.0.6.1 and earlier |
| IBM Data Risk Manager | Path Traversal | 2.0.4 and earlier |

## Remediation/Fixes

To obtain fixes for all reported issues, customers are advised first to upgrade to v2.0.6, and then to apply the most recent fix packs (2.0.6.2 is not cumulative -- it must be applied on top of 2.0.6.1). Existing customers can download the version 2.0.6 from IBM Passport Advantage at <https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/pacustomers.html>.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

The Authentication Bypass issue only exists if SAML authentication is enabled. The issue does not occur when using LDAP authentication, for example.  SAML authentication is not enabled by default.  Customers can upgrade to the fixed version or disable SAML authentication.

To address the default password issue, customers can upgrade to the fixed version, which requires a password reset on initial login. Alternatively, customers can follow the [product documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSJQ6V_2.0.6/com.ibm.idrm.doc/install/tsk/tsk_installguide_idrm_configuration.html "product documentation") and use the **passwd** command to change the default password for the IDRM administrative account.
