Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-4270:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from insecure file permissions on the `/opt/qvm/iem/bin/run-result-reader.sh` script. This script is owned by the `nobody` user, a low-privileged system account used by various services, including the QRadar web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure File Permissions:** The `run-result-reader.sh` script is owned by the `nobody` user, granting this user full control over the script's content.
- **Cron Job Execution:** The `run-result-reader.sh` script is executed periodically (every 20 minutes) by the `root` user's crontab. This means any commands within the script will be executed with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user, specifically `nobody` (achieved via a separate web application code execution vulnerability), can modify the `run-result-reader.sh` script to include malicious commands.
- **Full System Control:** When the modified script is executed by root's cron job, the attacker's commands gain root privileges, allowing them to take full control of the QRadar system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the QRadar system as the `nobody` user. This is stated to be possible through a separate code execution vulnerability in QRadar's web application.
- **Script Modification:** The attacker modifies the contents of the `run-result-reader.sh` script to include malicious commands.
- **Cron Job Execution:** The attacker waits for the `root` user's cron job to execute the modified script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Code Execution as nobody:** The attacker needs to achieve code execution with the privileges of the `nobody` user, for instance, via a web application vulnerability.
- **Local System Access:** The attacker needs to have some form of access to the QRadar system to modify the vulnerable script.
