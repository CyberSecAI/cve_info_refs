Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-4294:

**Root Cause:**

- The `RssFeedItem` class in the IBM QRadar web application fetches and parses RSS feeds.
- The application does not validate user-supplied RSS feed URLs.
- The `HttpClient` class is used to make a GET request to the URL provided by the user without performing any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Lack of URL validation allows an attacker to make requests to arbitrary URLs from the QRadar server.
- This includes internal services only accessible from localhost, like the Apache Axis AdminService webservice.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the SSRF, an attacker can reach the Apache Axis AdminService, which allows deploying and undeploying of webservices. This can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Tomcat user running the QRadar web application (typically the `nobody` user).
- An attacker can deploy a malicious webservice which can result in a full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **JSON-RPC calls:** An authenticated attacker can make a JSON-RPC call to the `qradar.getRssFeedItem` method with a crafted `feedURL` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a valid user of the QRadar application. No special privileges are needed.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the QRadar application.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is in the `com.q1labs.qradar.ui.dashboard.RssFeedItem` class.
- The `getRssFeedItem` method takes a `feedURL` parameter and passes it to the `RssFeedItem` constructor.
- The `RssFeedItem` constructor then uses the `HttpClient` class to make a GET request to the supplied `feedURL`.
- The Apache Axis `AdminService` is enabled, but it is configured to only accept requests from localhost. This restriction can be bypassed using the SSRF vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was reported to IBM by Yorick Koster.
- IBM has released fixes for QRadar versions 7.4.0 GA, 7.3.3 Patch 3, and 7.3.2 Patch 7.
- A proof of concept (POC) exploit involves using the SSRF to call the Apache Axis `AdminService`, and deploying a JSP shell.
