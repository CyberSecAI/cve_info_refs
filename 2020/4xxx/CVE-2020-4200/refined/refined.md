- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in how IBM Db2 handles specially crafted commands received from authenticated users via a JDBC client, causing the database to terminate abnormally.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A lack of proper input validation when processing JDBC commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in a denial of service, as the Db2 database terminates unexpectedly.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack through a JDBC client connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to send commands via a JDBC client.
