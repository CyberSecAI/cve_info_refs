- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Instability in the Kiosk Android Application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The instability allows for a bypass of MDM (Mobile Device Management) restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Bypassing MDM restrictions could allow unauthorized access or modifications to the device or its data.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability resides within the Kiosk Android Application itself, suggesting an attacker needs to have access to a device running the affected application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker likely needs to have physical or remote access to a device with the vulnerable Maas360 Android Mobile App installed and be in a position to interact with the application.
