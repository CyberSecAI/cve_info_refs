Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the review resource of Atlassian Fisheye and Crucible. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-provided input within the 'review objectives' field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** issue. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the application's web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have several impacts, including:
    -   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data theft.
    -   **Session Hijacking:** The injected script could be used to steal user session cookies, enabling an attacker to impersonate the victim.
    -   **Phishing:** The attacker can redirect users to a malicious website designed to steal user credentials.
    -   **Defacement:** Attackers could modify the appearance of the web page, potentially misleading or confusing users.

**Attack Vectors:**
    -   The attack vector involves injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the "review objectives" field.
    -   The injected code is then executed when a user views the review resource, resulting in the XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    -   The attacker needs to be able to submit or modify the review objectives to inject the malicious payload.
    -   No special privileges are required for this attack; any user with access to the review resource and ability to modify its objectives could potentially trigger it.

**Additional Notes**
    -   The issue affects versions of Fisheye and Crucible prior to 4.8.1.
    -   The vulnerability is considered a "Severity 2 - Major" issue.
    -   The issue was resolved in versions 4.8.1 and 4.8.3
    -   The vulnerability is tagged with "sxss" and "xss" labels, indicating a stored XSS (or persistent XSS) vulnerability where the malicious code is stored in the system.
