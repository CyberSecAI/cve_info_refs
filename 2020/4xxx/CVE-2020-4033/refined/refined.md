{
  "CVE-2020-4033": {
    "Description": "In FreeRDP before version 2.1.2, there is an out of bounds read in RLEDECOMPRESS. All FreeRDP based clients with sessions with color depth < 32 are affected. This is fixed in version 2.1.2.",
    "Root cause": "Out-of-bounds read in the RLEDECOMPRESS function due to missing bounds checks while processing compressed bitmap data.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious RDP server could trigger an out-of-bounds read on the client, potentially leading to a crash or information disclosure.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious RDP server sending crafted RLE compressed bitmap data to a vulnerable client.",
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the RDP server sending the malicious RLE compressed bitmap data and the target client must have a color depth less than 32.",
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability is present in all FreeRDP based clients when connecting to a server with a color depth less than 32. A workaround is to connect using a color depth of 32 using the '/bpp:32' option."
