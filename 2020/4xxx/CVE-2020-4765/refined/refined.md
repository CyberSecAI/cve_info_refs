- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the fact that IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management Monitoring allows certain web pages to be stored locally.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** This local storage of web pages can potentially allow another user on the same system to read the stored information.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An unauthorized user on the same system could gain access to sensitive information by reading the locally stored web pages.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local access on a system where IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management Monitoring is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
