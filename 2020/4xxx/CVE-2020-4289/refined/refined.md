- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Security Information Queue (ISIQ) does not set the HttpOnly flag for session cookies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of HttpOnly flag on session cookies.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A client-side script could obtain sensitive information from the ISIQ cookie, potentially leading to session hijacking or other unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** Client-side scripts (e.g., cross-site scripting (XSS)).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker must be able to execute malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable ISIQ application.
