The provided content does not directly mention CVE-2020-4875, but it does discuss multiple vulnerabilities addressed in IBM Cognos Controller. Here is a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**
- Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the IBM Runtime Environment Java used by IBM Cognos Controller.
- Vulnerabilities exist in IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty used by IBM Cognos Controller.
- XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities.
- Authentication Bypass vulnerabilities.
- External XXE vulnerabilities.
- Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID) vulnerabilities.
- Apache Log4j vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105 and CVE-2021-44832).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Java vulnerabilities in IBM Runtime Environment Java.
- Vulnerabilities in IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty.
- XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities.
- Authentication Bypass vulnerabilities.
- External (XXE) vulnerabilities.
- Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID) vulnerabilities.
- Apache Log4j vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105 and CVE-2021-44832).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The document does not detail the specific impact of each vulnerability.
- The potential impact is implied through the nature of the vulnerabilities (e.g., XXE could lead to information disclosure, authentication bypass could lead to unauthorized access, etc).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Not explicitly stated in detail, but the attack vectors are implicit:
    - Network-based attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in the Java environment, WebSphere Application Server, or through parsing of XML documents.
    - Potentially through user interaction that triggers vulnerable functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need network access to the IBM Cognos Controller instance.
- Exploitation depends on specific vulnerabilities; this document does not provide details on the specific capabilities or positions.
- Exploitation may require knowledge of the IBM Cognos Controller application and its underlying components.

**Additional Notes:**
- The document highlights the importance of upgrading to the specified fix versions.
- It references other security bulletins for Java SDK and Log4j vulnerabilities.

**Relation to CVE-2020-4875**
The document mentions CVE-2020-4876 but does not mention CVE-2020-4875, therefore: **UNRELATED**
