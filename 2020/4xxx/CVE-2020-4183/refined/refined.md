Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4183:

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-4183 is an OS Command Injection vulnerability affecting IBM Security Guardium.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an unspecified OS Command Injection vulnerability. The provided text does not give specifics on the vulnerable code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- OS Command Injection: This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full system compromise is possible because an attacker can execute OS commands with the privileges of the Guardium application.
- Data breach due to the ability to execute commands to extract sensitive information.
- Modification or deletion of critical system files.
- Denial of service by crashing the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The specific attack vector is not mentioned in this document, but generally, it involves sending specially crafted input to the Guardium application that is then interpreted as a command by the OS.
- It can be triggered through network-accessible interfaces exposed by the application.
-  It is also possible that the vulnerability exists in a local service accessible by a user with low privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send data to the vulnerable IBM Security Guardium instance to exploit the command injection. This may require network access to the server.
- The attacker likely needs to craft a specific command to inject into the system.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- IBM Security Guardium versions 10.5, 10.6, 11.0 and 11.1 are affected.

**Remediation:**
- Patches are available for the affected versions. Upgrade to the fixed versions of IBM Security Guardium as provided in the document or apply the provided patches.
