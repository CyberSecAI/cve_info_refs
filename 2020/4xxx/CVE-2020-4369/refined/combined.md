# Security Bulletin: IBM Verify Gateway PAM components default to cleartext storage of client secret (CVE-2020-4369)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

The IBM Verify Gateway (IVG) PAM components allow encryption of the client-secret property in the /etc/pam\_ibm\_auth.json file, but it's not the default configuration. Instead, customers must remember to add an --obfuscation command-line flag to encrypt the property. As of v1.0.1 of IVG for AIX PAM, and v1.0.2 of IVG for Linux PAM, the client-secret property is encrypted by default.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2020-4369](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-4369)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| IBM Verify Gateway (IVG) | PAM 1.0.0, 1.0.1 |

## Remediation/Fixes

Log in to IBM X-Force Exchange / App Exchange and download and install the latest IBM Security Verify Gateway (renamed from IBM Verify Gateway) PAM components. Specifically:

* IBM Security Verify Gateway for AIX PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) v1.0.1 at <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/hub/extension/e506cf66c5f51340cef3e1b40e8b4840>
* IBM Security Verify Gateway for Linux PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) v1.0.2 at <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/hub/extension/80eca9a1094b416db69dfff40eb10c5a>

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Add the --obf command-line flag when running /opt/ibm/ibm\_auth/ibm\_authd in order to generate an encrypted version of the client secret. Then, store the encrypted version in /etc/pam\_ibm\_auth.json by using the "obf-client-secret" parameter. For details, see the IBM Knowledge Center topic at [https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCT62/com.ibm.iamservice.doc/references/r\_verify\_pam\_ibmauthapi.html](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCT62/com.ibm.iamservice.doc/references/r_verify_pam_ibmauthapi.html "https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCT62/com.ibm.iamservice.doc/references/r_verify_pam_ibmauthapi.html").
