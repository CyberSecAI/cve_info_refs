Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The IBM Verify Gateway (IVG) PAM components, by default, store the client secret in cleartext within the `/etc/pam_ibm_auth.json` file. Although the software provides an option to encrypt the client secret, this feature was not enabled by default in affected versions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of the client secret in plain text, making it easily accessible to anyone with access to the file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker gaining access to the `/etc/pam_ibm_auth.json` file could extract the client secret. This could allow the attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and potentially gain unauthorized access to the systems or services protected by the IVG PAM components.
- **Confidentiality Breach:**  Exposure of the client secret compromises the confidentiality of the authentication process and can lead to further security breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** An attacker needs access to the file system of the machine where the affected IBM Verify Gateway PAM component is installed.
- **Local Access:** Local user with sufficient permissions or an attacker with compromised access to the system can read the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have access to the server's file system where the `/etc/pam_ibm_auth.json` file is located. This could be via:
    - Local access to the server
    - A compromised user account on the server
    - A remote system vulnerability that allows file system access

**More Detail than CVE Description:**
The provided content gives specific details, such as the exact file path (`/etc/pam_ibm_auth.json`) where the client secret is stored, the command-line flag (`--obf`) used to enable encryption, and the specific versions affected, including the version where the encryption became the default. The original description is a placeholder, so the information provided here is more detailed.
