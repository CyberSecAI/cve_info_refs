Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability allows privileged users to view certain internal directories within IBM DataPower Gateway. This suggests a flaw in access control or directory traversal within the application's file system.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core weakness is the insufficient access control that permits privileged users to view internal directories they shouldn't have access to. This could be due to incorrect permissions or a flawed mechanism for directory handling.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact is the potential exposure of sensitive data stored in those internal directories. The specific data exposed isn't detailed but could include configurations, keys, or other sensitive information related to the gateway's operation.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves a privileged user accessing internal directories through the DataPower Gateway interface. It's not clear whether this involves a specific tool or interface within the gateway itself.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have privileged user access to the IBM DataPower Gateway.
