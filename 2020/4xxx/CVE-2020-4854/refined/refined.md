Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4854:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way IBM Spectrum Protect Plus (SPP) handles authentication to its `vsnap` API. Specifically, the username and password used for authentication are written to a temporary file in the `/tmp` directory before being passed to the authentication process. The issue is that in some scenarios, these temporary files are not properly deleted after authentication, leaving the credentials exposed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Static Credentials:** The core issue is the use of hardcoded or static credentials, specifically the username and password for the `vsnap` user. These credentials should not be used for external authentication and should be handled more securely.
*   **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** Writing credentials to temporary files in `/tmp` with predictable filenames makes them easily accessible to local attackers if the files are not deleted immediately after use.
*   **Failure to Delete Temporary Files:** The system fails to reliably delete temporary files containing the `vsnap` user's credentials, leading to credential exposure.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls:** The `vsnap` user has excessive privileges, including the ability to use `sudo` to change the root password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the SPP host using the exposed `vsnap` credentials via SSH.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Once logged in as `vsnap`, the attacker can use `sudo` to change the root password, gaining complete control of the system.
*   **Data Breach:** With root access, the attacker can access sensitive data and perform other malicious activities on the compromised server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the SPP host to utilize the exposed credentials, typically via SSH.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the SPP host over the network.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and the location of the exposed credential files.
*   **Basic SSH Skills:** The attacker requires basic SSH skills to connect to the SPP host using the exposed credentials.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability exists in IBM Spectrum Protect Plus versions 10.1.0 through 10.1.6.
*   IBM has released fixes in versions 10.1.7 and 10.1.8, with 10.1.8 removing the additional vSnap migration steps that were required for the 10.1.7 fix.
*   The temporary files are created in `/tmp` with names like `vsnap-<pid>-<unix-time>-<uuid>-in.txt`.
*   The `vsnap` user has NOPASSWD sudo privileges for specific commands, including `passwd`.
*   Tenable discovered and reported this vulnerability to IBM.
