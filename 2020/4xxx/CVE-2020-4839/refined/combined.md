# Security Bulletin: Mitigations are being announced to address CVE-2020-4839 and CVE-2021-29695

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM products 8335-GCA, 8335-GTA, and 8335-GTB have identified security vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2020-4839](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-4839)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| 8335-GCA, 8335-GTA, and 8335-GTB | OP820 |

## Remediation/Fixes

None

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Mitigations for these vulnerabilities:

1. Use strong passwords that are at least 16 characters long with a mixture of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. By using more complex passwords, it makes it more difficult for malicious users to discover valid user credentials.
2. Keep the management network separate from the public network. Keeping the management network separate lessens security exposures by reducing the number of individuals who can access the systems.
3. Use an account which has the minimum authority needed.  Consider using an operator session for normal operations and using an admin session only when making administrative changes to the BMC.
4. Limit the duration sessions are logged in.  Always log out of sessions when done using them.  The default web session time out is 10 minutes, and can be changed from the  "Services" web page.
5. Place the BMC's management network behind a secure Linux box.  This may also be known as a jump box or bastion host.  Then secure that box with high security, multi-factor authentication, with logging and monitoring BMC logs, available from the BMC's web interface.
