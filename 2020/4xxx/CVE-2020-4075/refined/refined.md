Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to define unsafe window options on a child window opened via `window.open` in Electron applications. This allows for arbitrary local file reads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsafe handling of window options when creating child windows.
- Lack of proper validation or sanitization of window options passed to `window.open`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read arbitrary local files on the user's system. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information such as user data, application secrets, or configuration files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious HTML page that uses `window.open` with specifically crafted options.
- The attack is triggered when an Electron application opens this malicious page or when an attacker can inject this malicious code into a vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the content loaded by an Electron application or inject code into an application that uses `window.open`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Electron versions prior to 7.2.4, 8.2.4, and 9.0.0-beta.21.
- The advisory suggests preventing the default behavior of the `new-window` event and verifying the URL and options before opening new windows as a workaround.
