- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient command validation in IBM Security Information Queue (ISIQ) where command requests originating from the web UI are not properly encoded or escaped.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input validation, specifically encoding or escaping of command requests from the web UI. This allows for command injection through manipulated input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could intercept a product configuration request and modify it by injecting illegal characters. This allows an attacker to tamper with commands sent to the ISIQ system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web UI of ISIQ, where an attacker intercepts and modifies requests before they are processed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to intercept requests made from the web UI to the backend system.
