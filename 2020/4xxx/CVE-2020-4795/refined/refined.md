- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The forgot password endpoint for IBM Security Identity Manager could reveal valid users and allow the reset of their passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure and insecure password reset. The vulnerability lies in the "forgot password" functionality, which can be exploited to reveal valid user accounts and permit unauthorized password resets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could enumerate valid user accounts and then reset their passwords, leading to unauthorized access to affected accounts.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the vulnerable "forgot password" endpoint of IBM Security Identity Manager.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to access the vulnerable endpoint, likely through a web interface, and initiate the "forgot password" process. No prior account information, or level of access is indicated as required beyond the ability to reach the endpoint.
