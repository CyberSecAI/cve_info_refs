- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Authd service in IBM Verify Gateway (IVG) listens on TCP port 12 and is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack. Sending malformed requests to this port causes the service to crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a denial-of-service vulnerability. The Authd service does not properly handle malformed requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in the crashing of the Authd service, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending malformed requests to TCP port 12 where the Authd service is listening.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to TCP port 12 where the service is listening.
