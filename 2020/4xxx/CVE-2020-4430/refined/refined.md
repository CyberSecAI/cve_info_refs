The provided content is related to CVE-2020-4430.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The document lists multiple vulnerabilities affecting IBM Data Risk Manager, including Authentication Bypass, Command Injection, Default Password, and Path Traversal. CVE-2020-4430 is associated with the "Default Password" vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Default Password:** The software uses a default password for the IDRM administrative account, which can be easily exploited by attackers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker exploiting the default password vulnerability could gain unauthorized access to the system and perform administrative actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers could use the default credentials to log into the IDRM administrative interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to access the login interface of the affected IBM Data Risk Manager instance. No special privileges would be required before authentication as the default password allows access.

**Additional Information:**
- The document indicates that the default password vulnerability exists in version 2.0.6.1 and earlier.
- The document also details remediation steps which include upgrading to a patched version of the software, which will trigger a password reset on first login. Customers can also manually change the default password using the passwd command.
- The document suggests that the Authentication Bypass vulnerability is triggered when SAML authentication is enabled, and does not occur when using LDAP authentication.
- The document also identifies Command Injection and Path Traversal vulnerabilities in earlier versions of the product.
