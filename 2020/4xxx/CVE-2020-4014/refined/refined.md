- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authorization in the `/profile/deleteWatch.do` resource.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly verify if a user is authorized to remove another user's watching settings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can remove another user's watching settings for a repository. This can disrupt a user's ability to track changes to the watched repository.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker sends a crafted request to the `/profile/deleteWatch.do` resource.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the affected Fisheye and Crucible instance and an active user session (i.e. the attacker must be logged in)

The vulnerability affects Atlassian Fisheye and Crucible versions before 4.8.1.
