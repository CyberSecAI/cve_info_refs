- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Dynamic Workload Console for IBM Workload Scheduler is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS). This vulnerability can be exploited after login, by modifying an outgoing request during the loading process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page that could be executed in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious activities. The vulnerability can generate an alert in the browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker modifies outgoing requests during the loading process after a successful login.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests after a user has logged into the Dynamic Workload Console. This implies the attacker could be in a privileged network position or able to perform man-in-the-middle attacks.
