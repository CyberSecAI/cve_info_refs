Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4371:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of a leftover debug header file within the IBM Verify Gateway (IVG) PAM component installation packages. This file was intended for debugging purposes during development and was unintentionally included in the released product.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unnecessary File Inclusion:** The primary weakness is the presence of a debug header file that should not be part of the final product package.
- The content doesn't specify the exact nature of the debugging information contained in the leftover file and why its presence is a security concern.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The document does not specify the potential impact of exploiting this vulnerability. While the header file is present, the document does not describe how an attacker could use it for malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The document does not provide specific attack vectors. The presence of the leftover file may open an attack surface that could potentially be abused.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would likely need access to the affected system where the vulnerable IBM Verify Gateway PAM components are installed. The attacker would also need to be able to read the leftover header file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by removing the debug file from the installation packages in newer versions of the IVG for AIX PAM (v1.0.1) and IVG for Linux PAM (v1.0.2).
- The document doesn't explain why the header file presents a security risk, which makes it difficult to determine the true nature of this vulnerability.
- The document states that there are no workarounds or mitigations besides upgrading to the patched versions.
