Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-4076:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a context isolation bypass in Electron applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Context Isolation Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability for code in the main world context of a renderer process to access the isolated Electron context. This circumvents the intended security boundary provided by context isolation.
- **Leaked Cross-Context Objects:** The vulnerability arises from how objects are handled across contexts, specifically that objects from the isolated Electron context are being leaked to the main world context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privileged Actions:** Successful exploitation allows malicious code in the renderer process to execute privileged actions that should be restricted to the isolated Electron context, potentially compromising the application and the user's system.
- **Security Breach:** The bypass of context isolation fundamentally breaks the intended security model, leading to potential arbitrary code execution and data access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Code in Renderer:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the renderer process through various means (e.g. XSS vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks, or malicious extensions), gaining access to the main world context.
- **Cross-context object leaks:** The vulnerability occurs due to cross-context object leaks that can be exploited from the renderer's main world context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Execute Code in Renderer:** The attacker must be able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the renderer process of an Electron application. This can be achieved through various means like exploiting an existing XSS vulnerability or through supply chain attacks.
- **Target Application Using Context Isolation:** The vulnerable application must be configured to use `contextIsolation` for this vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Electron versions prior to `7.2.4`, `8.2.4`, and `9.0.0-beta.21`.
- There are no workarounds at the application level, users must update their Electron version to patch the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity.
- The provided github content clearly maps this vulnerability to CVE-2020-4076.
