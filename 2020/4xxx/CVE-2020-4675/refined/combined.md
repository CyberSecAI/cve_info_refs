# Security Bulletin: 3RD PARTY IBM InfoSphere MDM Inspector - Cross Site Request Forgery

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

In the MDM Inspector web application, CSRF protection is implemented by validating that the referer header is set to a allowlisted domain. It is possible to include the allowlisted domain as a subdomain of an attacker-controlled domain to bypass this validation, allowing for a CSRF attack to be launched from the attacker-controlled domain. Example attacker-domain that would be accepted by an Inspector application hosted on example.internal: example.internal.attacker.com. As the validation is not performed on the entirety of the referer header, the application will accept example.internal.attacker.com as a valid referer, allowing for CSRF to be performed from this domain.
