Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4675:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `Referer` header in the IBM InfoSphere MDM Inspector web application. Instead of checking for an exact match against an allowlisted domain, the application only verifies if the `Referer` header *contains* the allowlisted domain as a subdomain. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious URL by embedding the allowlisted domain as a subdomain of an attacker controlled domain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Referer Validation:** The application's failure to perform a complete match on the `Referer` header allows bypass via subdomain inclusion.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The insufficient validation allows an attacker to perform CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a legitimate user within the affected application. This is a standard CSRF attack consequence.
*   The impact depends on the specific actions an attacker can force a user to perform, which is not detailed in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Link/Website:** The attacker crafts a malicious website or link that, when visited by an authenticated user of the IBM InfoSphere MDM Inspector web application, triggers a CSRF request to the vulnerable application.
*   **Exploiting Subdomain Validation:** The attacker crafts a domain with the allowlisted domain as a subdomain (e.g., `example.internal.attacker.com`) which passes the referer header check, enabling the CSRF attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host a Malicious Website or Control a Domain:** The attacker must be able to host a web page or have control over a domain that can be used to launch the CSRF attack.
*   **Target Must Be Authenticated:** The user must be authenticated to the vulnerable application when the malicious action is triggered, since it uses the active session.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Web Protocols:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP Referer headers and CSRF attacks.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The suggested remediation involves updating the allowlist validation to require a full match, by ensuring it ends with a forward slash `/`. For example, `<https://accounts.google.com/>` rather than `<https://accounts.google.com>`.
*   The fix or workaround is to ensure the allowlist param ends with `/`, which forces a full match against the domain in the referer header.
*   The affected product is IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management version 11.6.
