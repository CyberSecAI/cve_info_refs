Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a DLL search order hijacking issue in the Microsoft Windows client used by IBM Db2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   DLL Search Order Hijacking: The application attempts to load a DLL without specifying the full path. This allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL with the same name in a location where the application searches for DLLs before the legitimate location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary code execution: By placing a malicious DLL, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Local access: The attacker needs to have local access to the Windows system where the vulnerable IBM Db2 is installed.
*   File placement: The attacker must be able to place a malicious DLL in a location where the vulnerable application will search for it before the correct location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Local authenticated user: The attacker must have a valid user account on the affected Windows system.
*   File write access: The attacker needs the ability to write files to a directory that is searched by the vulnerable application when loading DLLs.

**Additional Information:**
*   Affected Products: IBM Db2 versions 9.7, 10.1, 10.5, 11.1, and 11.5 on Windows are affected. Linux and Unix are not affected.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Hou JingYi (@hjy79425575) of Qihoo 360 CERT.
*   IBM provides special builds and fixes for the affected versions.
*   The document provides links to download the fixes for different versions and architectures.
