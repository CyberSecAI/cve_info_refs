- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in the `ndmauth` modules of IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for UNIX.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with limited system privileges can exploit the vulnerability to manipulate CD UNIX and obtain root privileges. This leads to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the `ndmauth` modules of IBM Sterling Connect:Direct for UNIX.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user authorized for limited system privileges on the vulnerable system.
