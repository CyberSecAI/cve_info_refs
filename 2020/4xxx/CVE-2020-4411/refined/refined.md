- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unspecified vulnerability in IBM Spectrum Scale allows a local attacker to cause a denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability results in a denial-of-service condition in the kernel.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: A local, unprivileged user can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local, unprivileged user on the system running a vulnerable version of IBM Spectrum Scale.
