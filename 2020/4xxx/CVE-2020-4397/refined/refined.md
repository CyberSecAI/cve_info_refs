- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Verify Gateway (IVG) Authd service listens on TCP port 12 and transmits sensitive information in cleartext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext transmission of sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially eavesdrop on the network traffic and obtain sensitive information transmitted to and from the vulnerable service.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, sniffing the network traffic on TCP port 12.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to monitor or intercept network traffic on the network where the IVG Authd service is running.
