- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Protection Mechanism Failure in the file downloading functionality of the Atlassian Companion App.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows for arbitrary .exe file execution due to a failure in the protection mechanism during file downloading.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers who control a connected Confluence Server instance can execute arbitrary .exe files on systems running the vulnerable Companion App. This leads to potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers need to control a Confluence Server instance that is connected to a vulnerable Companion App. Then, through this controlled instance, they can trigger the download of a malicious .exe file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs control over a Confluence Server instance that the vulnerable Atlassian Companion app is connected to.
