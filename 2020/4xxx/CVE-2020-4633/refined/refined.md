Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user-controlled data (field names or values) when generating Excel reports. Specifically, if a cell value in the generated Excel file begins with characters such as =, +, -, or @, it can be interpreted as a formula by Excel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Formula Injection: The primary vulnerability is formula injection. By injecting a formula into an Excel cell, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code or retrieve sensitive data when the report is opened.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  When an attacker injects a malicious formula in an Excel report, the impact is that the formula can be executed by a user opening the spreadsheet and could potentially execute arbitrary code, disclose sensitive information, or perform other malicious actions, depending on the specific formula injected.
- The report is generated by the platform, which could lead users to trust the content and ignore security warnings that Excel may display.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack vector involves manipulating field names or values within the Resilient platform such that, when these data are included in a generated Excel report, they begin with "=", "+", "-", or "@".
-  The attacker would need to have the ability to influence the data that is used for report generation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker must have the ability to create or modify data within the IBM Resilient platform that will be used in an Excel report. This implies the attacker has some level of access to the Resilient platform.
-  The attacker needs to understand that this report is going to be exported to Excel.

**Additional details:**
-   The security bulletin provides a mitigation by enabling the `reports.character_blocklist_enabled` option, which prevents report generation if data starts with the vulnerable characters.
-   The bulletin also provides commands for enabling, disabling, and checking the status of the mitigation.
