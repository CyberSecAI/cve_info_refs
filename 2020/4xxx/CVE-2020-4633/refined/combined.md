# Security Bulletin: IBM Resilient Platform could allow formula injection in Excel (CVE-2020-4633)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Formula injection is possible in an Excel report generated by the Resilient platform, when a field name or value begins with specific characters.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2020-4633](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-4633)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| Resilient OnPrem | IBM Security SOAR |

## Remediation/Fixes

A spreadsheet, such as Excel, is susceptible to a formula injection if a cell begins with one of these characters:

* Equals to (“=”)
* Plus (“+”)
* Minus (“-“)
* At (“@”)

In most cases, Excel displays a warning when the files is opened, but users might ignore it since the report was generated from the platform.

As of Resilient platform V39, you can enable the **reports.character\_blocklist\_enabled** option. You can upgrade to this level of the platform by following instructions in the "[Upgrade Procedure](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBRUQ_39.0.0/doc/install/resilient_install_upgrading.html "Upgrade Procedure")" section in the IBM Knowledge Center.

Once enabled, this parameter prevents the generation of the report if the data causes a cell to begin with one the characters, and it displays the following message:

```

Report Failed

An error occurred while generating your report.

```

To enable this option, use the following command:

```
sudo resutil configset -key reports.character_blocklist_enabled -bvalue true
```

To disable this option, use the following command:

```
sudo resutil configset -key reports.character_blocklist_enabled -bvalue false
```

To check whether or not this option is enabled, use this command:

```
sudo resutil configget -key reports.character_blocklist_enabled
```

If the value 1 is returned, the option is enabled. If the value 0 is returned, the option is not enabled.
