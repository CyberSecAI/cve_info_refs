{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests, specifically the absence of a whitelist to restrict allowed domains in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of CORS requests which can lead to data exposure.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers could potentially bypass security measures by exploiting the lack of proper CORS restrictions. It may be possible to access sensitive data.",
  "Attack vectors": "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests manipulation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to initiate or manipulate CORS requests to the vulnerable server."
