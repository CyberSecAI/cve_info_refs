Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-4077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Electron handles context isolation when used in conjunction with `contextBridge`. Specifically, the vulnerability allows code running in the main world context of a renderer process to bypass the intended isolation and access the isolated Electron context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Context Isolation Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability of code in the main world to reach into the isolated Electron context.
- **Improper Context Handling:** This suggests a flaw in how the context bridge is implemented or how isolation is enforced, allowing for unauthorized access between contexts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Exploitation allows code in a less privileged context to access and execute privileged actions normally restricted to the isolated Electron context.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** This could lead to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges if the attacker can inject or control the code in the main world.
- **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially access or manipulate sensitive data within the isolated context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Renderer Process:** The vulnerability is triggered via the renderer process of an Electron application.
- **Main World Code:** The attacker needs to execute code in the "main world" context of the renderer. This could be achieved through various means like exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's web content, or through malicious script injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Execute Code in Main World:** The attacker must be able to execute arbitrary code within the main world context of the renderer. This could be accomplished via cross-site scripting (XSS), or other similar web vulnerabilities.
- **Knowledge of ContextBridge API:** Although not explicitly mentioned, some knowledge of the contextBridge API might be required to exploit the vulnerability effectively.

**Affected Versions:**
The affected Electron versions include:
- >= 9.0.0-beta.0 <= 9.0.0-beta.20
- >= 8.0.0-beta.0 <= 8.2.3
- >= 7.0.0-beta <= 7.2.3
- < 7

**Patched Versions:**
The vulnerability is fixed in Electron versions:
- 7.2.4
- 8.2.4
- 9.0.0-beta.21

**Additional Notes:**

- The advisory emphasizes that there are no application-side workarounds, and updating Electron is the only way to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" in severity.
- The advisory does not provide specific CWEs.
