- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The JSON web token (JWT) secret is stored in plain text in one of the YAML files of IBM Security Information Queue (ISIQ).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hard-coded credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access or manipulation of the system is possible with the exposed JWT secret.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to the YAML file where the JWT secret is stored can obtain the secret. The location of the vulnerable file is not specified but it is implied that this file is part of the deployed ISIQ product.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs access to the file system where the ISIQ application is installed, specifically the location where configuration files are stored.
