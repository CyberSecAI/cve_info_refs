Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the "excel export" portal functionality of the iTop software. The ajax endpoint for this functionality, when called directly, bypasses scope filtering.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The ajax endpoint for the excel export lacks proper scope filtering.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** The ability to directly call the ajax endpoint without proper checks allows unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** A portal user could potentially export more data than they are authorized to access.
*   **Information Leakage:** This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information that should be limited based on user scope.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Ajax Call:** An attacker can directly call the vulnerable ajax endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Portal User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account within the iTop portal.
*   **Knowledge of the Endpoint:** The attacker must know the specific ajax endpoint used for excel export.
*   **No Specific Network Position:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in iTop versions prior to 2.7.2 and 3.0.0.
*   It is fixed in versions 2.7.2 and 3.0.0.
*   The vulnerability is considered high severity.
