The provided content relates to CVE-2020-4062.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Conjur OSS helm chart, in versions prior to 2.0, installed the Conjur Postgres database with an open port, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure default configuration of the Postgres database, exposing it on an open port.
- Lack of proper authentication and authorization controls for the database connection.
- Cleartext communication between the Conjur pod and the Postgres pod.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full read and write access to the Conjur Postgres database.
- Potential for privilege escalation, leading to full control over the Conjur system.
- Ability to retrieve any secret stored within Conjur.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker needs to know the IP address and port number of the Postgres database.
- Attacker requires access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur is running.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur is deployed.
- Knowledge of the Postgres database's IP address and port.
- Ability to connect to the database directly.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Conjur OSS deployments using the helm chart version less than 2.0.
- The fix involves adding password authentication and TLS support for the Postgres database connection in helm chart v2.0.
- CyberArk recommends upgrading to helm chart v2.0 or later to remediate the vulnerability.
- Mitigations include deploying Conjur OSS in an isolated Kubernetes cluster or namespace with restricted access.
