Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4883:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a cross-domain information disclosure issue. The specific technical details of how this cross-domain information disclosure occurs are not provided in this document.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-domain information disclosure. This generally means that information intended to be kept within a specific security domain (e.g., a website, application, or user session) can be accessed by another, unauthorized domain. This is a common web security vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact is the disclosure of information across domain boundaries. The type of information is not specified, but it could potentially be sensitive and may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access or insights. The document mentions that the CVSS score is environment-specific, so the impact may vary depending on the system where QRadar is running.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a cross-domain information disclosure, it's not clear from this document how this would be exploited. It likely means an attacker could make a request from one domain that unintentionally exposes information from a different domain.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need the ability to make cross-domain requests to the QRadar SIEM system. The specific prerequisites (e.g. local network access vs. web accessible) are not given, more information would be needed.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- IBM QRadar 7.3.0 to 7.3.3 Patch 7
- IBM QRadar 7.4.0 to 7.4.2 Patch 2

**Remediation:**
Patches have been released to address the issue:
- QRadar 7.3.3 Patch 8
- QRadar 7.4.2 Patch 3
