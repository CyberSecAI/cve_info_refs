- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the IBM QRadar SIEM web UI, which allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to embed malicious JavaScript code in the Web UI. This could potentially lead to unauthorized actions within a trusted session, including the disclosure of sensitive user credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web UI by injecting malicious javascript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to find an injection point within the QRadar SIEM web UI that does not properly sanitize or encode user supplied data.
