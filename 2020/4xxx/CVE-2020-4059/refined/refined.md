Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-4059:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `mversion` library's `git.commit` function, before version 2.0.0, failed to properly sanitize user-provided input used in git commit messages. Specifically, the `message` parameter, which is used as part of the git commit command, was not properly escaped.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization of the commit message allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the git commit command. The injected commands would then be executed on the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If an application using the vulnerable version of `mversion` uses user-controlled data as part of the commit message, an attacker could inject malicious commands into the git commit command leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted commit message to the `update` function that is ultimately passed to the `git.commit` function.
*   An attacker would need to find an application that is using the vulnerable version of the `mversion` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control the commit message that is used when the `mversion` library is used.
*   The attacker needs to target an application that utilizes the vulnerable version of `mversion`.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.0.0 of the `mversion` library.
*   The advisory suggests that users can work around the issue by sanitizing commit messages themselves.
*   The advisory states that no CWEs (Common Weakness Enumeration) are associated with this issue, however, this is a clear case of CWE-78 (OS Command Injection).
