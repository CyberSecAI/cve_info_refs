Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-4222

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a command injection flaw in IBM Spectrum Protect Plus.
- The application fails to properly validate user-supplied input, specifically the password parameter, before using it in a system call. This allows for the injection of arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw, where an attacker can insert malicious commands into the password parameter.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application lacks proper validation of user-supplied strings, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Root Access:** The attacker can execute code with root privileges, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, allowing attackers to target vulnerable systems over a network.
- **Password Parameter:** The attack vector is specifically through the password parameter, which is not properly validated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the targeted system.
