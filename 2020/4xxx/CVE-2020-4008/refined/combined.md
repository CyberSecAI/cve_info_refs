##### **3. VMware Carbon Black Cloud macOS Sensor installer file overwrite issue (CVE-2020-4008)**

**Description**

The installer of the macOS Sensor for VMware Carbon Black Cloud handles certain files in an insecure way. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Low severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a CVSSv3 base score of [3.6](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L).

**Known Attack Vectors**

A malicious actor who has local access to the endpoint on which a macOS sensor is going to be installed, may overwrite a limited number of files with output from the sensor installation. The malicious actor would have to trick a victim to install malware in order to obtain such access. Exploitation of this issue can only occur at a specific point of time during the installation process and depends on specific conditions.
