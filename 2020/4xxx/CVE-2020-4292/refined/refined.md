- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy in IBM Security Information Queue (ISIQ) is too permissive, allowing all origins to access the ISIQ Web Server resources. This is unnecessary for ISIQ functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Overly permissive CORS policy.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Unnecessary cross-domain access to ISIQ web server resources.
- **Attack vectors**: Cross-origin requests from any domain.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can initiate requests from any domain to the ISIQ web server.
