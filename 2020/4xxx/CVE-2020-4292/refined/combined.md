# Security Bulletin: IBM Security Information Queue has overly permissive CORS policy (CVE-2020-4292)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

The cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy in IBM Security Information Queue (ISIQ) is too permissive. It allows all origins to access the ISIQ Web Server resources when such cross-domain accesses are unnecessary for ISIQ functionality. As of v1.0.5, ISIQ no longer permits cross-origin resource sharing.

## Vulnerability Details
