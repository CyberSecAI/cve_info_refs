- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition in how IBM Db2 handles symbolic links could allow a local user to obtain sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Race condition, symbolic link handling vulnerability, information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user could potentially gain access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires a local user with the ability to manipulate symbolic links.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local user with the ability to create and manipulate symbolic links on the system.
