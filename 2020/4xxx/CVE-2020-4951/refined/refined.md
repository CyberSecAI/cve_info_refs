Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-4951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is not explicitly stated in the provided content. However, it mentions that IBM Cognos Analytics versions 11.1.7 and 11.2.0 are susceptible to vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The content indicates that the IBM Cognos Analytics software has multiple vulnerabilities that, when successfully exploited, could lead to the following:

*   Disclosure of sensitive information
*   Addition or modification of data
*   Denial of Service (DoS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities includes:
*   Exposure of sensitive data.
*   Unauthorized modification of data.
*   Disruption of service due to Denial of Service.

**Attack Vectors:**
The CVSS vector for CVE-2020-4951 is  `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`
*   AV:L (Local Attack Vector)
*   AC:L (Low Attack Complexity)
*  PR:L (Low Privileges Required)
*   UI:N (No User Interaction)
*   S:U (Unchanged Scope)
*   C:L (Low Confidentiality impact)
*   I:N (No Integrity impact)
*   A:N (No Availability impact)

This implies that an attacker would require local access with low privileges, with no user interaction required for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have local access to the affected system.
*   The attacker requires only low privileges on the system.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The IBM document does not directly provide information about the vulnerability other than it being addressed in newer versions.
*   The NetApp document includes CVE-2020-4951 in a list with other vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-29679 and CVE-2021-29745).
*   The NetApp document provides a CVSS score for the vulnerability which is 3.3 (LOW).

The NetApp advisory provides more details, including the affected products and the CVSS score, as well as the impact of the vulnerability, compared to the IBM Security Bulletin which only refers to the CVE as being fixed.
