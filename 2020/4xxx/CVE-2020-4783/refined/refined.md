Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of TLS version 1.1 protocols in IBM Spectrum Protect Plus.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the enablement of the older TLS 1.1 protocol which is known to have security vulnerabilities and is considered less secure than newer versions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker could potentially exploit this weakness to obtain sensitive information. The specific nature of the information is not detailed in this document.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker could exploit the vulnerability over a network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be remote and capable of network communication with the vulnerable IBM Spectrum Protect Plus server.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is due to the usage of the TLS 1.1 protocol in IBM Spectrum Protect Plus versions 10.1.0 through 10.1.6. This could allow a remote attacker to potentially obtain sensitive information. The fix involves upgrading to version 10.1.7 or higher which disables TLS 1.1.
