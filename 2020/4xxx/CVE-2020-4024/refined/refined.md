Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-4024

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied content within issue attachments that have the `vnd.wap.xhtml+xml` content type. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The core vulnerability is an XSS issue, where malicious scripts can be injected and executed within the context of a user's browser when they view an affected attachment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript which, when executed, can lead to various malicious activities like:
    *   Stealing user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.
    *   Data theft.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** An attacker uploads a file with the vulnerable `vnd.wap.xhtml+xml` content type that contains malicious HTML/JavaScript to an issue attachment.
*   **User Interaction:** When another user views the issue attachment, the malicious code is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs to be able to upload files to a Jira instance, typically requiring an account with permissions to create or edit issues and their attachments.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Content Type:** The attacker needs to know that the `vnd.wap.xhtml+xml` content type can be used to inject code in the affected versions.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack relies on a user viewing the crafted attachment.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Versions before 8.5.5
*   8.6.0 to 8.8.2 (excluding 8.8.2)
*   8.9.0 to 8.9.1 (excluding 8.9.1)

**Fixed Versions:**

*   8.5.5
*   8.8.2
*   8.9.1
*  8.10.0

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is classified as "Low" priority by Jira, however, it has the label of `cvss-high`.
*   The issue was resolved relatively quickly, with the fix being available in the very next releases of affected versions.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under the "Issue - Attachments" component in Jira.
