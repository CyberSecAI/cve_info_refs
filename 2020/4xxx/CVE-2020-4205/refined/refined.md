- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When a certificate is removed from an APIc TrustStore, the corresponding DataPower ValCred may not be updated to match.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inconsistent state between the APIc TrustStore and the DataPower ValCred.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability could lead to DataPower using a ValCred that does not reflect the current APIc TrustStore, potentially causing authentication or authorization issues.
- **Attack vectors:** Removing a certificate from the APIc TrustStore could lead to the vulnerability. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to remove certificates from the APIc TrustStore.
