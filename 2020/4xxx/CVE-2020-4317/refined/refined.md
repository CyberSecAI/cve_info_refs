- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in IBM Intelligent Operations Center.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious actions when other users interact with the compromised data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts which are then stored within the application and executed when a user accesses the affected functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to inject malicious script into the application's data storage. The specific location of the vulnerable input is not specified in this document.
