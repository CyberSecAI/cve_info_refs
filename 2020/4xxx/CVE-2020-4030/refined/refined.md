    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious client may trigger an out-of-bounds read, leading to a potential denial of service. Logging might bypass string length checks due to an integer overflow.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Network",
        "RDP connection"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A malicious RDP client can exploit this vulnerability. No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker would need to send specially crafted data to the server."
