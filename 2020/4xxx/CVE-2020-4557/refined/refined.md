- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in IBM Business Process Manager and IBM Business Automation Workflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform a cross-site scripting attack. The specific impact isn't detailed, but XSS vulnerabilities can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface web pages.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Specific details on how the XSS can be triggered are not provided, but this generally involves injecting malicious script into a web application, which is then executed by the victim's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the affected IBM product. The specific method and capabilities aren't stated but the attacker would need access to a vulnerable part of the application, possibly an input field that does not sanitize the input.
