{
  "CVE-2020-4032": {
    "Root cause": "Integer casting vulnerability in the `update_recv_secondary_order` function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Casting Vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could potentially cause a client crash, or possibly other undefined behavior related to incorrect data handling due to the casting error. The specific impact is not clearly defined, but could lead to data corruption or denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a client processes data from the RDP server. An attacker-controlled server can send malicious secondary orders to the client to trigger the vulnerability. The attack vector is network-based.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker would need to control an RDP server or perform a man-in-the-middle attack to modify server responses to a FreeRDP client. The attacker also needs to have knowledge on how to craft a malicious secondary order to trigger the vulnerable code path. The attacker has to be able to initiate an RDP connection with the vulnerable FreeRDP client."
