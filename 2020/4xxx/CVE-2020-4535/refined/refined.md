- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of input leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability allows for cross-site scripting attacks which could lead to malicious code execution, session hijacking, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts into input fields that are not properly validated by the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to find a way to inject malicious scripts into vulnerable parts of the application that are not properly sanitized.
