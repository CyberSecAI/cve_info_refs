Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the presence of a hard-coded password within the IBM Spectrum Protect Plus product. This hard-coded password allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Hard-coded credentials:** The primary weakness is the inclusion of a hard-coded password within the product's code for an account used by the Discovery Server service. This is a well-known security vulnerability as it provides a known authentication bypass mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to bypass the intended authentication mechanisms.
- **Unauthorized access:** Bypassing authentication can lead to further exploitation, such as unauthorized access to system resources, data, or administrative functions. The CVSS score indicates a potential for low impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable IBM Spectrum Protect Plus instance.
- **No authentication required:** The attacker doesn't need any initial credentials or access. They exploit the hard-coded password directly.

**Additional Information:**
- Affected products are IBM Spectrum Protect Plus versions 10.1.0 through 10.1.5.
- A fix is available in version 10.1.6.
- The vulnerability was reported by Jeremy Brown from the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- The vulnerability exists within the processing of login requests to the Discovery Server service.
