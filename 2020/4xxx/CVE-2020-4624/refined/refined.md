- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms during negotiation. Specifically, TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are not disabled by default.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of older TLS protocols (1.0 and 1.1) which are considered weak and vulnerable to attacks
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially decrypt sensitive information due to the use of weaker cryptographic algorithms.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks where an attacker intercepts communication during the TLS handshake.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept network traffic between a client and the vulnerable CP4S instance.
