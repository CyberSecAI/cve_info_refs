Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from the application allowing username enumeration.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The application does not implement proper checks or rate-limiting to prevent an attacker from attempting to validate usernames.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can use this to determine if a user exists or not on the system. This information can be used in subsequent attacks, such as password guessing attempts.

Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited via the login interface by attempting different usernames and observing system responses.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker requires network access to the login interface of the application.
