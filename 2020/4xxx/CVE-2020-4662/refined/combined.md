# Security Bulletin: A vulnerability exists in the Event Streams 10.0.0 schema registry that allows unauthorised access to create, edit and delete schemas (CVE-2020-4662)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A vulnerability exists in the Event Streams 10.0.0 schema registry that allows unauthorised access to create, edit and delete schemas

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2020-4662](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-4662)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| IBM Event Streams | 10.0.0 |

## Remediation/Fixes

To fix this issue you will need to have access to the following image in the ibm entitled registry

cp.icr.io/cp/ibm-eventstreams-schema-proxy@sha256:7ff23bc286cc4b1557287a8e48af1716150e88b0d2c5eeb0c9faf538ba2806e8

If you have an air gapped install you will need to pull down this image into your private image repository and make a note of the location.

1. Modify the ClusterServiceVersion (csv) of the eventstreams operator.
2. Get the name of the eventstreams csv, runÂ `oc get csv -n <NAMESPACE>`, substituting `<NAMESPACE>` for where you have deployed IBM Event Streams. You should get an entry named ibm-eventstreams.v2.0.0 or ibm-eventstreams.v2.0.1
3. Edit the csv and find the following environment variable EVENTSTREAMS\_DEFAULT\_SCHEMA\_REGISTRY\_PROXY\_IMAGE.
4. Replace the image tag associated with this env var with either the image mentioned above or the one you've pulled into your local private registry.
5. Save the csv. This will restart the operator with the updated env var and then update the Schema Registry with the required fix
