- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper authorization checks in the Event Streams 10.0.0 schema registry.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The schema registry allows unauthorized access to create, edit, and delete schemas. This indicates a missing or flawed access control mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can create, modify, or delete schemas without proper authorization. This could lead to data corruption, denial of service, or other unauthorized modifications within the Event Streams environment.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the network interface used to access the schema registry. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable schema registry and does not need authentication.
