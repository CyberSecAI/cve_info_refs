Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-4469:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-4211. The fix attempted to mitigate command injection by single-quoting the hostname parameter. However, this mitigation was insufficient, and command injection is still possible by using specially crafted input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The application is still vulnerable to command injection via the `hostname` parameter in an HTTP POST request to the `/emi/api/hostname` endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the system by injecting commands through the hostname parameter.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing any prior authentication or valid credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable IBM Spectrum Protect Plus instance.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTTP POST request containing the command injection payload within the hostname parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited using a `curl` command to send a crafted POST request to the `/emi/api/hostname` endpoint. The payload is included in the `hostname` parameter, which executes system commands within the single quotes (').
- Example Payload:  `hostname=';id >/tmp/cmd_injection;echo '`

**Additional Notes:**
- The Tenable advisory highlights that this is an incomplete fix to CVE-2020-4211.
- IBM Spectrum Protect Plus versions 10.1.0-10.1.5 are affected.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" by Tenable.
