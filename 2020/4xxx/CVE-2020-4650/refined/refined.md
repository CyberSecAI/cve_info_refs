Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-4650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from IBM Maximo Spatial Asset Management allowing web pages to be stored locally.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the ability for the application to store web pages locally in a manner that they can be read by other users on the same system. This suggests a lack of proper access controls or isolation of user data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation could lead to information disclosure, as one user can read the locally stored web pages of another user on the system. The specific content of these stored pages is not detailed but is implied to contain potentially sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves a malicious user accessing locally stored web pages generated by another user of the same Maximo Spatial Asset Management system. The local filesystem is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have access to the local filesystem of the system where IBM Maximo Spatial Asset Management is running and where web pages are being stored. It would appear that the attacker would need to be a user of the same system.
