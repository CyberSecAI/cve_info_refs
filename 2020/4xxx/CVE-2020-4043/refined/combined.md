## Description

![@Maikuolan](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12571108?u=597aad1d1da6a12518c22cf0aa2047bf85c7a7f2&v=4&size=48)[Maikuolan](https://github.com/Maikuolan)opened [on Aug 23, 2018](https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/issues/167#issue-353515512)

An unserialization vulnerability was recently discovered which affects the phar wrapper. Due to that phpMussel implements the phar wrapper for reading archives, this vulnerability also currently affects all currently supported versions of phpMussel to the extent of its ability to read archives.

I would ***strongly*** recommend that all phpMussel users ***disable archive checking*** in phpMussel until further notice. This can be achieved by setting `check_archives` to `false` in the phpMussel configuration (at which point, phpMussel would be unable to scan the content of archives, but would also be protected from this vulnerability).

Currently planning exactly how to resolve this problem for phpMussel, but it'll most likely involve a complete overhaul of how phpMussel handles archives, and involve completely ditching the phar wrapper in favour of something else. Anyway, I'll reply here with any relevant updates that happen, new information, etc, and announce here when the problem is resolved.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've discovered a new vulnerability, please firstly attempt to reasonably confirm which versions of the package the newly discovered vulnerability affects.

If it affects only versions on branches that've already reached "EoL/Dead" status (i.e., doesn't affect anything on any currently maintained branches, tagged or otherwise), it most likely won't ever be fixed, and the best course of action would be to report all pertinent details directly to the issues page at this repository. We can then document the vulnerability and encourage any affected users to update to a non-affected version as soon as possible.

If it affects any versions on any currently maintained branches (tagged or otherwise, and including any active dev code), we'll do what we can to fix the problem as soon as possible (assuming that it hasn't already been fixed since the latest available versions at the affected branches).

If the vulnerability has already been fixed, is already public knowledge, or has otherwise already been publicly disclosed somehow by the project somewhere (e.g., in our changelogs, at our GitHub issues page, at our GitHub discussions page, etc), the best course of action would be to report all pertinent details directly to the issues page at this repository. If an issue concerning the vulnerability already exists, we would ask that you append your report to that issue, rather than creating additional issues (to avoid duplication and clutter at the issues page). If no such issue exists yet, we welcome you to create one.

However, if the vulnerability hasn't been fixed yet, isn't yet public knowledge, and hasn't yet been publicly disclosed by the project anywhere (e.g., no relevant issues created yet and nothing at any of our channels; i.e., if you've found a "zero-day"), we would ask then that you keep user safety in mind and to report your findings in a responsible, conscientious manner. Public disclosure of previously unknown vulnerabilities and "zero-days", when affecting currently supported versions, could directly put users at risk from those that may wish to do them, their websites, or their data harm. (This, of course, refers only to vulnerabilities; Bugs or faults in the codebase that wouldn't generally be regarded as vulnerabilities could still be posted directly to the issues page).

In cases where reporting to the issues page or to publicly accessible channels would pose such risks to users, or where private communication may be required for any particular reason, you're welcome to contact [me](https://github.com/Maikuolan) by other means (such as email or [private messaging](https://www.facebook.com/caleb.mazalevskis)).

## Currently Known Vulnerabilities

### Phar unserialization vulnerability.

* **Description:** phpMussel's *former* reliance upon PHP's phar wrapper for reading archives means that an unserialization vulnerability in PHP's phar wrapper is exploitable at the affected phpMussel versions. There aren't any known cases of exploitation in the wild, but uploading a specially crafted file to an affected version allows arbitrary code execution (discovered, tested, and confirmed by [the package author](https://github.com/Maikuolan)), so the risk factor should be regarded as **very high**. Newer phpMussel versions don't use PHP's phar wrapper, and are therefore unaffected.
* **Related issues:** [#167](https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/issues/167)
* **GitHub Security Advisory:** [GHSA-qr95-4mq5-r3fh](https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/security/advisories/GHSA-qr95-4mq5-r3fh)
* **CVE:** [CVE-2020-4043](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-4043)
* **Affected versions:** phpMussel >= 1.0.0 < 1.6.0
* **Solution:** Update to phpMussel v1.6.0 or newer. Alternatively, if updating isn't possible, disable archive checking entirely by setting the "*check\_archives*" configuration directive to "*false*" (thus avoiding execution of the affected parts of the codebase entirely). There doesn't seem to be any fix for the phar wrapper vulnerability, meaning that changing PHP versions won't do anything to solve the problem here.

|  |  | === Changes made since last versioned release === |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | (none) |
|  |  | - [2018.10.12-17; Maikuolan]: Completely dropped all support for scanning phar |
|  |  | files with phpMussel, due to vulnerabilities discovered in the way that the |
|  |  | phar wrapper was implemented in phpMussel (with no safer, more secure |
|  |  | alternative known at this time for handling phar files, I neither plan nor |
|  |  | anticipate ever reintroducing phar support in the future). Deprecated and |
|  |  | completely removed the allow\_symlinks configuration directive (we don't need |
|  |  | this anymore, because it was intended to address a problem in phar, which we |
|  |  | won't be using anymore anyway). Dropped the max\_recursion default value from |
|  |  | 10 down to 3 as a means to tighten security and improve safety for when |
|  |  | handling archives. Completely overhauled the way that phpMussel deals with |
|  |  | archives during a scan event, ditching almost all code associated with the |
|  |  | archive phase of scanning, and implementing a separate, newly created archive |
|  |  | handler, compression handler, and temporarily file handler. phpMussel now |
|  |  | partially utilises OOP for handling archives, and includes a small number of |
|  |  | classes in its codebase (a possible stepping stone towards a future v2.0.0). |
|  |  | File decompression is now implicit, rather than explicit. Slightly improved |
|  |  | the aesthetic for displayed scan results in CLI where archives are concerned. |
|  |  | The recursor closure isn't responsible for the code associated with the |
|  |  | archive phase of scanning anymore. Instead, a new, separate archive recursor |
|  |  | closure has been created to deal with the code associated with the archive |
|  |  | phase of scanning. Zip archive scanning is now fully recursive. Rar archive |
|  |  | scanning is now fully supported (can scan recursively, can detect encryption, |
|  |  | etc). Added quine detection. Added a table to the documentation to clarify |
|  |  | which compression and archive formats are and aren't supported, and removed |
|  |  | some otherwise ambiguous wording about it from the documentation and L10N |
|  |  | data. Refactored all chameleon attack detection code. |
|  |  |  |

# Phar unserialization vulnerability

High

[Maikuolan](/Maikuolan)
published
GHSA-qr95-4mq5-r3fh
Jun 10, 2020

## Package

composer

Maikuolan/phpMussel
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 1.0.0 < 1.6.0

## Patched versions

>= 1.6.0

composer

phpMussel/phpMussel
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

>= 1.0.0 < 1.6.0

>= 1.6.0

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

Anyone using >= v1.0.0 < v1.6.0.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

Yes. Upgrading to at least >= v1.6.0 (the earliest safe version) will resolve the problem. However, as multiple new major versions have been released since that version, upgrading to the latest available version is recommended, in order to protect against any potential future vulnerabilities, unknown at the time of writing this advisory.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Yes. In the package's configuration, disable archive checking by setting `check_archives` to `false` (thus avoiding execution of the affected parts of the codebase entirely).

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

Yes. The vulnerability is documented at [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/security/policy) and also at [#167](https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/issues/167).

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Comment at the issue linked to this advisory, or..
* Contact [the package author](https://github.com/Maikuolan).

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-4043

### Weaknesses

[CWE-502](/advisories?query=cwe%3A502)

I know we were originally going to stick to closures and hold out on going
full OOP on the core until v2, and 'cleanup' won't work on classes, but
seeing as I need to completely overhaul archive functionality already
anyway, and I don't feel too great about doing it all again 6 months or
whatever down to track if I can avoid it, I've opted to take this approach
immediately for archives and compression, and we can just consider it a
'stepping stone' to a future v2 or whatever.

Feel free to review/audit/comment this commit if you'd like. I don't shy
away from feedback! However, don't pull this into master just yet. This
commit forks a new branch, and a crapload of work still needs to be done
yet to the phpMussel core before anything is viable. Committing the work
done thus far now to avoid monster-sized commits later down the track, when
we're ready to pull (this commit is only a small piece of what's needed).")`

Basically works properly now, but there are still a few small details to be
