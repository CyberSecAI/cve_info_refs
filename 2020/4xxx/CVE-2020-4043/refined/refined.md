{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2020-4043",
    "description": "phpMussel's former reliance upon PHP's phar wrapper for reading archives makes it vulnerable to an unserialization vulnerability in PHP's phar wrapper. This allows arbitrary code execution by uploading a specially crafted file.",
    "affected_versions": "phpMussel >= 1.0.0 < 1.6.0",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of PHP's phar wrapper, which is vulnerable to unserialization attacks. phpMussel used this wrapper to handle archive files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe deserialization of data"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution is possible if a specially crafted file is uploaded to a vulnerable phpMussel installation.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Upload of a specially crafted file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to upload files to the phpMussel system.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present because of the reliance on the vulnerable phar wrapper in PHP. There is no known fix to the phar wrapper vulnerability, and therefore upgrading PHP will not fix the issue. The vulnerability was addressed by removing the use of the phar wrapper in phpMussel version 1.6.0 and later versions. A workaround to avoid this vulnerability in earlier versions is to disable archive checking by setting the `check_archives` configuration directive to `false`."
