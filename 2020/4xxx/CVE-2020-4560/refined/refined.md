- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the web UI of IBM Financial Transaction Manager for High Value Payments, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within a trusted user session, potentially leading to:
    - Altered functionality of the application.
    - Disclosure of sensitive credentials or other confidential information within the user's session.
- **Attack vectors:** By embedding malicious JavaScript code within the Web UI through user-supplied input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the input fields of the vulnerable application. This might involve crafting malicious URLs or forms.
