- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Hard-coded cryptographic keys in multiple locations within IBM QRadar Network Security.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hard-coded cryptographic keys.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The bulletin doesn't specify the impact, but it is implied that the hardcoded keys could be used to compromise the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Not specified, but likely involves leveraging the hardcoded keys, possibly through network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Not explicitly stated, but would require an attacker to have access to the vulnerable system or network.
