- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak cryptographic algorithm within the Map Tester of the Map Editor in IBM Sterling B2B Integrator.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Usage of weak cryptographic algorithm.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The provided document does not detail the specific impact of exploiting this vulnerability. However, the usage of weak cryptography can often lead to information disclosure or unauthorized modification.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability exists in the Map Tester of the Map Editor, suggesting that an attacker would need access to this component. The specific attack vector (e.g., local access, network-based) is not specified in the document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to interact with the Map Editor component. The document does not clarify if this requires authenticated access or if this is exposed over a network.
