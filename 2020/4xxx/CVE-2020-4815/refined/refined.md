Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the presence of sensitive information within HTTP response headers in IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) version 1.4.0.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Exposure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information via HTTP response headers. This can include details that shouldn't be accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information. The bulletin mentions that this information could be utilized by an attacker, which suggests that the exposed data could have further impact if combined with other vulnerabilities or used for targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Access:** The attack vector is remote. An attacker doesn't need local access to the system.
- **Network Sniffing/Interception:** The vulnerability can be exploited by intercepting or inspecting HTTP responses. This could be achieved through various network-based attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected server and receive responses (e.g., being on the same network or having access over the internet).
- **Passive or Active Interception:** The attacker needs the capability to intercept and analyze the HTTP responses.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-4815 describes a vulnerability in IBM Cloud Pak for Security 1.4.0.0, where sensitive information is included in HTTP response headers. This information disclosure vulnerability could be exploited remotely by an attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic, potentially leading to further malicious activity. The vulnerability is resolved in CP4S version 1.5.0.0 and later versions.
