- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability occurs when a specific function in the Spatial Datablade is called with an out-of-range parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows a local user to execute commands as a privileged user, potentially leading to a system crash.
- **Attack vectors:** A local user with the ability to execute arbitrary SQL can call the vulnerable function with an out-of-range parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the server and ability to execute arbitrary SQL.
