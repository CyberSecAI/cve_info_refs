# Stored XSS through template injection

Moderate

[NGPixel](/NGPixel)
published
GHSA-9jgg-4xj2-vjjj
Jun 14, 2020

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

> 2.4.17

## Patched versions

2.4.107

## Description

### Impact

Wiki.js 2.4.105 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through template injection. This vulnerability exists due to an insecure validation mechanism intended to insert v-pre tags into rendered HTML elements which contain curly-braces.

By creating a crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. The following figure shows an example Wiki.js page (using the raw-HTML editor mode) which executed attacker provided JavaScript:

```
<h1>Title</h1>
<p>Some text here</p> {{constructor.constructor('alert("Wiki.JS Stored XSS")')()&#x7d&#x7d
```

This vulnerability exists due to template injection text in a top level text element bypassing the protections provided by `v-pre`.

### Patches

Commit [9e08718](https://github.com/requarks/wiki/commit/9e08718ee904046f8b2294ef6ac79e8a75a451e3) fixes this vulnerability by wrapping any text elements at the root level and correctly matching both normal and encoded mustache template characters.

Thanks to [@denandz](https://github.com/denandz) for reporting this vulnerability.

### Severity

CVE-2020-4052
