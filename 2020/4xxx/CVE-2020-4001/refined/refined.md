- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SD-WAN Orchestrator ships with default passwords for predefined accounts. The same salt is used in conjunction with the default password of predefined accounts on freshly installed systems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Default passwords, predictable password hashing due to the use of the same salt for default accounts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows for Pass-the-Hash attacks to gain unauthorized access. An attacker could potentially access the system using the default credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could use the default credentials or a precomputed hash of the default password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs knowledge of default credentials, the ability to conduct a Pass-the-Hash attack, and network access to the SD-WAN Orchestrator.
