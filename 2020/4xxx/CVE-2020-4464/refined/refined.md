Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4464:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the handling of the SOAP protocol. This leads to the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary weakness is the improper handling of deserialization within the SOAP protocol, allowing an attacker to inject malicious data.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** User-supplied data is not adequately validated, which allows the vulnerable deserialization to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected WebSphere server.
- **Root Access:** The attacker can potentially execute code in the context of the root user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is carried out over the network, targeting the vulnerable SOAP protocol handling.
- **SOAP Protocol:** The vulnerability resides within the handling of the SOAP protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker does not need local access to the server, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the WebSphere server.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is a result of insecure deserialization when handling SOAP requests in IBM WebSphere Application Server. Specifically, the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data in SOAP messages leads to the deserialization of untrusted data. By sending specially crafted SOAP messages, attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server with root privileges. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network without authentication.

**Additional Points:**
- IBM has provided fixes for this vulnerability, which involve upgrading to specific fix packs or applying interim fixes.
- The vulnerability was reported to IBM by "tint0" working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- CVSS v3 score of 9.8 indicates a critical severity level.
