- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the disclosure of sensitive information through HTTP response headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system exposes information in HTTP headers that can be used by an attacker. This includes unspecified details that provide an attacker with clues.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure. This information could then be leveraged by attackers to focus and improve the effectiveness of subsequent attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through HTTP requests and responses, specifically by analyzing the response headers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable system and analyze the responses.
