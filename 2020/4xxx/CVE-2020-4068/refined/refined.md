Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-4068:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how `APNSwiftSigner.sign(digest:)` handled memory when writing to a BIO buffer within the OpenSSL library. Specifically, the code used `BIO_puts` incorrectly, which is designed for null-terminated strings, while the input data was arbitrary byte data without a null terminator. Subsequently, when `BIO_write` was called, it would operate on the same underlying memory region but with an incorrect size causing a heap-buffer-overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap buffer overflow:**  The primary vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow. The `BIO_puts` function will write past the allocated buffer when given non-null-terminated data and then a subsequent `BIO_write` operation may cause issues when its size calculation is incorrect based on the prior corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The heap buffer overflow could lead to a crash or potentially allow an attacker to overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if the vulnerability is leveraged strategically.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the function `APNSwiftSigner.sign(digest:)`.  By supplying a crafted digest to be signed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to influence the input to `APNSwiftSigner.sign(digest:)` to trigger the overflow. This would require the attacker to control the data being signed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content contains a lot of extraneous information, including GitHub navigation menus, terms of service, etc., which has been removed in this summary.
- The fix involved correctly using `BIO_write` for arbitrary byte data instead of `BIO_puts` (which is for null terminated strings), and properly managing the buffer size.
- The issue was identified using AddressSanitizer, a memory error detector.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #32, and released in version 1.0.1 of the `APNSwift` library.
