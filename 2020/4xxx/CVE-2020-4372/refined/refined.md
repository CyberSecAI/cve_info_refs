- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The IBM Verify Gateway (IVG) components, when debug tracing is enabled, include client secrets in the debug logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Exposure of sensitive information (client secrets like username, password, client-id) in debug logs when debug tracing is active.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker with access to the debug logs could obtain sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Access to the debug logs of the affected IVG components.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Ability to access the debug logs on systems running the vulnerable IBM Verify Gateway components where debug tracing is enabled.
