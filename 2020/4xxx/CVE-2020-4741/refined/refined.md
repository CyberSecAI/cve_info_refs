- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in IBM InfoSphere Metadata Asset Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application that are then executed by other users.
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious scripts are stored within the application, and then executed when a user views the content, which could lead to session hijacking, data theft or other malicious activities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script into the vulnerable application.
