# Security Bulletin: IBM InfoSphere Information Server may be vulnerable to attacks based on privilege escalation

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A potential vulnerability based on privilege escalation was addressed by IBM InfoSphere Information Server.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2020-4347](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-4347)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version |
| --- | --- |
| InfoSphere Information Server, Information Server on Cloud | 11.7 |
| InfoSphere Information Server, Information Server on Cloud | 11.5 |
| InfoSphere Information Server | 11.3 |

If your Information Server installation uses WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment (WAS ND), it is affected if the following apply:

* was initially installed using a umask weaker than 022

    Note that the install instructions indicate that umask 022 should be used.

                                         --  or  --
* is Information Server version 11.7.1.0 or versions 11.7.0.x, or such an installation was upgraded to a release after 11.7.1.0

    Note:

         1. Versions 11.5 and 11.3 are not impacted until they are upgraded to version 11.7.

         2. A new installation of version 11.7.1.1 (or later) is not impacted.

## Remediation/Fixes

You should do the following steps (only needed once over the lifetime of the installation):

   Stand-alone deployment

   1.  In your WAS ND location, change directory to the directory containing the java folder.

   2.  chmod -R 755 java

   Cluster deployment

   1.  On the machine where your deployment manager is installed

        a.  change directory to the directory containing the java folder within your WAS ND installation

        b.  chmod -R 755 java

   2.  On a machine where a custom profile is installed

        a.  change directory to the directory containing the java folder within your WAS ND installation

        b.  chmod -R 755 java

   3.  Repeat step 2 for each custom profile, and horizontal machine that is a member of the cluster.
