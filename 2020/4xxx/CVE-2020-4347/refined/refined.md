**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect file permissions on the `java` directory within the WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment (WAS ND) installation used by IBM InfoSphere Information Server. Specifically, if the initial installation used a umask weaker than 022, or if the system is running version 11.7.1.0 or versions 11.7.0.x,  or if a system was upgraded to a version after 11.7.1.0, the permissions on the java directory are too permissive.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Inadequate file permissions on the `java` directory, leading to potential privilege escalation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially leverage these insufficient permissions to escalate privileges within the system by manipulating files in the java directory.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves exploiting the insufficiently secured file permissions on the java directory within WAS ND installations used by IBM InfoSphere Information Server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would require access to the system where the vulnerable IBM InfoSphere Information Server and WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment is installed, and they must be able to write to the `java` directory. This could include local users on the system.
