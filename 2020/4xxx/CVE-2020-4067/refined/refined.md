{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The STUN/TURN response buffer is not properly initialized.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Information Leak: Uninitialized memory is used for padding in STUN/TURN response buffers leading to leakage of information between different client connections.",
    "CWE-665: Improper Initialization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information by querying the server and reading padding bytes from the connection of another client.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious client can connect to the coturn server and send specially crafted queries that would force the server to use the uninitialized memory buffer.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a client that can establish a connection with the coturn server."
