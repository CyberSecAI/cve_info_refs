- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Passwords provided as part of a URL for an administrative COPY command may appear in the administrative log.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information (passwords) in logs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local users could potentially gain access to remote credentials by viewing the administrative log.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with local access could view the administrative logs and obtain the remote credentials if they were provided in a URL for an administrative COPY command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system and its logs.
