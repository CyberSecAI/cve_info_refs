  "CVE-2020-4271": {
    "Description": "A PHP object injection vulnerability was found in the QRadar Forensics web application. The vulnerability can be triggered via a specially crafted cookie and can be used by an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The commands will be executed with the privileges of the Apache system user.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists due to insecure deserialization of user-controlled data from a cookie in the `DataSetModel::restore()` method. This method deserializes data obtained from a cookie, which, when crafted maliciously, can lead to the instantiation of arbitrary PHP objects.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Lack of proper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the Apache user.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted cookie to the affected web application.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Authenticated attacker is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious serialized PHP object and include it in a cookie, which will then be processed by vulnerable code.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability exists in the `DataSetModel` class of the QRadar Forensics web application. The `restore()` method is called in the constructor of various chart classes. These classes are exposed in the `/forensics/graphs.php` page of the Forensics web application. A POP chain using the `License` class and `simple_html_dom_node` class can be used to trigger the vulnerability."
