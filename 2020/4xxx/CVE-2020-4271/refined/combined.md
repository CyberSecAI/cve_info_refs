IBM Community Forums

Security Data in QRadar SIEM is added as Log Sources, which listen for data from or connect to remote
sources
to collect events. Each log source has a corresponding Device Support Module (DSM) that parses and
normalizes events for 400+ devices. Users on QRadar Community Edition 7.5.0 and later require a larger
footprint to run
QRadar Community Edition, but have access to all of the same DSMs and protocols as enterprise customers.
Several log source types can auto discover in QRadar by DSM type or event format, such as LEEF, JSON,
CEF, or Name Value Pair (NVP). Users can launch the Log Source Management (LSM) app to manually add or
modify log sources in QRadar.

1. Review the [QRadar
   Supported DSMs list](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.5?topic=configuration-qradar-supported-dsms).
2. Run a QRadar automatic update to get the latest DSMs and Protocols.
3. Use the [Log
   Source Management app](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.5?topic=configuring-qradar-log-source-management-app) to add or configure your log sources that do not auto discover.
4. Advanced. Use the [DSM
   Editor](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.5?topic=administration-event-data-processing-in-qradar) to create your own Log Source Type.

QRadar Community Edition FAQ
**Who can download QRadar Community Edition?**

QRadar Community Edition is a free version of our enterprise QRadar SIEM that is provided without
warranty or support. Users can download a 3-month license that can be extended each quarter to
continue using Community Edition. QRadar Community Edition offers students, developers,
security teams, or small organizations the option to use QRadar under a limited license. As
QRadar SIEM is subject to export restrictions, some users are not able to download the software
where the United States Export Administration Regulations (EAR) has declared a restriction.

**Is the QRadar Community Edition free of charge?**

Yes, QRadar Community Edition is available to users at no cost and is provided as-is without
warranty or support.

**Can I upgrade QRadar Community Edition?**

QRadar Community Edition is based off of our enterprise QRadar SIEM (Classic) release of QRadar
7.5.0 Update Package 10. Users who have entitlement to IBM Fix Central through work or your
corporate account have access to download an SFS that can be used to upgrade your version.
Students, app developers, or security enthusiasts who download QRadar Community Edition would
not have access, so QRadar Community Edition is not considered as an upgradeable version for
non-enterprise users.

* Access to IBM Fix Central: If yes, and you have access to IBM Fix Central and entitlement to
  QRadar SIEM, you can upgrade to the latest version with an Upgrade Package (SFS file) and
  then apply the QRadar Community Edition license file from this website.
* Access to IBM Fix Central: No. Users who want to upgrade to a newer version can install the
  latest ISO file to flatten their existing installation of QRadar Community Edition.

**Can I renew my license for QRadar Community Edition?**

Users who have installed QRadar Community Edition where the 3-month license has expired can
return to this site and download the latest key file. You are not required to reinstall or
upgrade to the latest QRadar Community Edition and can apply the latest key to extend your
current install. As QRadar Community Edition is a non-warranted product and offered as-is, you
as the downloader are the responsible party for your network and software security. IBM
recommends that users upgrade to the latest version when new ISOs are posted for QRadar
Community Edition.

* Access to IBM Fix Central: If yes, and you have access to IBM Fix Central and entitlement to
  QRadar SIEM, you can upgrade to the latest version with an Upgrade Package (SFS file) and
  then apply the QRadar Community Edition license file from this website.
* Access to IBM Fix Central: No. Users who want to upgrade to a newer version can install the
  latest ISO file to flatten their existing installation of QRadar Community Edition.

**Can I install other appliance or managed host types?**

QRadar Community Edition includes a license that is intended for users to install QRadar as an
All-in-One Console appliance. The installation menu in the installer allows users to select
other appliance types or use the ISO file to install managed hosts and connect them to the
Console. Users can install an App Host appliance as it does not require an EPS license. However,
other appliance types you attached to the Console will experience license issues after the
initial license expires.

* QRadar Console
* App Host appliance

**Is there support for QRadar Community Edition?**

No. QRadar Community Edition is provided without warranty or support assistance. Users who
require assistance can discuss QRadar Community Edition in the forums, but QRadar Support does
not take support cases or tickets on QRadar Community Edition from any users. Entitled users
with support contacts who use QRadar Community Edition in a lab environment should not open
cases.

IBM Community Forums

**Where can I find documentation?**

QRadar Community Edition users can refer to the QRadar core documentation to learn about
installation, features, or functionality.
QRadar Getting Started

QRadar Support Technical Notes

**What is the operating systems for QRadar Community Edition?**

Red Hat Enterprise 8.8 (Ootpa) is the operating system (OS) that runs QRadar Community Edition.

**Can I install QRadar Community Edition on a Cloud provider?**

QRadar Community Edition is intended to be deployed on a VM or physical hardware. Users can
deploy QRadar Community Edition on Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud, but there are
no marketplace images available at this time for these platforms. When the enterprise version of
QRadar SIEM is released, there is typically a marketplace image to streamline the installation
process for full product users. However, these versions do not exist for QRadar Community
Edition, so any installation types on a cloud provided would be a custom install type and might
not install as expected.

QRadar Reddit (/r/QRadar)

IBM Community Forums

**How long is the QRadar Community Edition license valid?**

The QRadar Community Edition license is provided in 3-month intervals. Each quarter, IBM will
publish an updated license file where users can extend their QRadar Community Edition license
for another 3 months. License files are retrieved from the same location as the ISO and users
can upload a .key file to extend their QRadar Community Edition experience.

**Are there features offered in QRadar Community Edition that is provided in the paid enterprise
product?**

The release of QRadar Community Edition is limited by the license type provided. Users cannot
install other managed host types

**Are automatic updates available in QRadar Community Edition?**

Yes, daily and weeekly auto updates are provided to users on QRadar Community Edition. As
protocols, device support modules (DSMs), QRadar identifiers (QID map), and scanner modules are
released, these are received by QRadar Community Edition installations that have network
visibility to **https://auto-update.qradar.ibmcloud.com/**. If you have a proxy
enabled in your lab environment or strict firewall blocking, you might be required to update
your rules to allow the auto update.

**Can I download and install apps from the X-Force App Exchange?**

QRadar Community Edition users can install any applications from the X-Force App Exchange.
Applications can use anywhere from 200MB to 2GB or RAM based on the app capabilities, such as
Machine Learning. Administrators might not be able to install applications that exceed the
default 10% of RAM allocated to the Console. Users who install at 24GB of RAM have 2.4GB of RAM
allocated to run applications or content such as rules, dashboards, searches, or custom
properties added through QRadar content packs.

**Can I use QRadar Community Edition for app development?**

This answer depends on the type of users or the app purpose.

* **IBM Technology Partners**: If you are an IBM Technology Partner and want to
  write
  a DSM integration or application for your product, you can contact the [IBM
  Technology Alliance Program (TAP)](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/partners-and-integrations-ibm-security-technology-alliance-program-tap) team. The TAP program can provide you an extended
  license and guidance on app development. The TAP team can assist
  with most aspects of integrating or app development to guide partners from getting started,
  IBM’s quality assurance process, secure development, and publishing your app on the X-Force
  App Hub.
* **Personal use**: Yes, QRadar Community Edition can be used to learn about app
  development for QRadar. Apps developed in this way are intended only for personal and
  non-commercial use.

Development Best Practices

**I am having problems installing QRadar Community Edition. Who can help?**

There is a robust online community where you can post questions and learn from peers. Users can
ask questions in the QRadar subreddit or the Community forums to ask other users about
particular questions or installation issues.

**Are any features disabled in QRadar Community Edition?**

QRadar Community Edition has all of the same features as our enterprise QRadar SIEM 7.5.0 Update
Package 10 release. Community Edition users are limited to 100 EPS and cannot install add-on
products or managed hosts, such as Event Processors, QRadar Network Insights, Risk Manager,
Event Collectors, or Data Nodes. Users can install other software, such as WinCollect 10 or the
Disconnected Log Collector to send in events to QRadar Community Edition.

PHP object injection vulnerability in QRadar Forensics web application
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yorick Koster, September 2019

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A PHP object injection vulnerability was found in the QRadar Forensics
web application. The vulnerability can be triggered via a specially
crafted cookie and can be used by an authenticated attacker to execute
arbitrary commands. The commands will be executed with the privileges of
the Apache system user.

CVE-2020-4271 [2]
6189651 [3] - IBM QRadar SIEM is vulnerable to PHP object injection
(CVE-2020-4271)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tested versions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This issue was successfully verified on QRadar Community Edition [4]
version 7.3.1.6 (7.3.1 Build 20180723171558).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix
------------------------------------------------------------------------
IBM has released the following versions of QRader in which this issue
has been resolved:

- QRadar / QRM / QVM / QNI 7.4.0 GA [5] (SFS)
- QRadar / QRM / QVM / QRIF / QNI 7.3.3 Patch 3 [6] (SFS)
- QRadar / QRM / QVM / QRIF / QNI 7.3.2 Patch 7 [7] (SFS)
- QRadar Incident Forensics 7.4.0 [8] (ISO)
- QRadar Incident Forensics 7.4.0 [9] (SFS)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------
QRadar [10] is IBM's enterprise SIEM [11] solution. A free version of
QRadar is available that is known as QRadar Community Edition [4]. This
version is limited to 50 events per second and 5,000 network flows a
minute, supports apps, but is based on a smaller footprint for
non-enterprise use.

A PHP object injection vulnerability was found in the QRadar Forensics
web application. The vulnerability exists in the DataSetModel class and
can be triggered via a specially crafted cookie. By exploiting this
issue it is possible for authenticated users to instantiate arbitrary
PHP objects. It has been confirmed that a POP chain exists that can be
used to execute arbitrary commands. The commands will be executed with
the privileges of the Apache system user (generally the nobody user).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Details
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Forensics web application contains functionally to save graph data
in cookies. When a graph is viewed that was previously saved, the data
will be restored from the cookie value(s). Saving and restoring data is
done using PHP object serialization. The serialized data is compressed
and encoded with base64 before it is returned as cookie to the user.
Deserialization of graph cookies is done in the restore() method of the
DataSetModel as is shown in the code fragment below.

/opt/ibm/forensics/html/DejaVu/Reports/DataSetModel.php:
public function restore($dataKeys, $dsize) {
        if ($dsize == 0)
        // No data
                return null;

        $cookieData = '';
        foreach ($dataKeys as $dataKey) {
                if (array_key_exists($dataKey, $_COOKIE)) {
                        $cookieData .= $_COOKIE[$dataKey];
                        // All done, so delete the data cookie.
                        setcookie($dataKey, "", time() - 3600);
                } else {
                        error_log("MISSING COOKIE '$dataKey'");
                        return null;
                }
        }

        $sz = strlen($cookieData);
        if ($sz != $dsize) {
                error_log("ERROR: Graph data size incorrect: expected $dsize, got $sz");
                return null;
        }

        try {
                $dataset = unserialize(gzuncompress(base64_decode($cookieData)));
                return $dataset;
        } catch (Exception $e) {
                error_log("Error deserializing session data: " . $e->getMessage());
                $dataset = null;
        }
        return null;
}

The restore() method is called in the constructor of various chart
classes, which all inherit from the BaseChart class. These chart classes
are exposed in the /forensics/graphs.php page of the Forensics web
application.

/opt/ibm/forensics/html/DejaVu/Charts.php:
abstract class BaseChart extends ParameterizedObject {
[...]
        public function __construct($params=null) {
[...]

        $dm = empty($dmodel) ? new DataSetModeler(null) : new $dmodel(null);
        if(array_key_exists('sid',$_GET))
            $dm->setSessID($_GET['sid']);

        $dataset = $dm->restore($dataKeys,$dsize);
[...]

It has been confirmed that this vulnerability can be used to execute
arbitrary commands by sending a specially crafted cookie to the affected
web page.

## Introduction

[QRadar](https://www.ibm.com/security/security-intelligence/qradar) is IBM's enterprise [SIEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management) solution. A free version of QRadar is available that is known as [QRadar Community Edition](https://developer.ibm.com/qradar/ce/). This version is limited to 50 events per second and 5,000 network flows a minute, supports apps, but is based on a smaller footprint for non-enterprise use.

A PHP object injection vulnerability was found in the QRadar Forensics web application. The vulnerability exists in the `DataSetModel` class and can be triggered via a specially crafted cookie. By exploiting this issue it is possible for authenticated users to instantiate arbitrary PHP objects. It has been confirmed that a *POP chain* exists that can be used to execute arbitrary commands. The commands will be executed with the privileges of the Apache system user (generally the `nobody` user).

## Details

The Forensics web application contains functionally to save graph data in cookies. When a graph is viewed that was previously saved, the data will be restored from the cookie value(s). Saving and restoring data is done using PHP object serialization. The serialized data is compressed and encoded with base64 before it is returned as cookie to the user. Deserialization of graph cookies is done in the `restore()` method of the `DataSetModel` as is shown in the code fragment below.

***/opt/ibm/forensics/html/DejaVu/Reports/DataSetModel.php:***

```
public function restore($dataKeys, $dsize) {
	if ($dsize == 0)
	// No data
		return null;

	$cookieData = '';
	foreach ($dataKeys as $dataKey) {
		if (array_key_exists($dataKey, $_COOKIE)) {
			**$cookieData .= $_COOKIE[$dataKey];**

The `restore()` method is called in the constructor of various chart classes, which all inherit from the `BaseChart` class. These chart classes are exposed in the `/forensics/graphs.php` page of the Forensics web application.

***/opt/ibm/forensics/html/DejaVu/Charts.php:***

```
abstract class BaseChart extends ParameterizedObject {
[...]
	public function __construct($params=null) {
[...]

        $dm = empty($dmodel) ? new DataSetModeler(null) : new $dmodel(null);
        if(array_key_exists('sid',$_GET))
            $dm->setSessID($_GET['sid']);

        $dataset = $dm->restore($dataKeys,$dsize);
[...]

```

It has been confirmed that this vulnerabilty can be used to execute arbitrary commands by sending a specially crafted cookie to the affected web page.

## Proof of concept

Execution of arbitrary commands is possible by abusing the `License` class. The `get_license_info()` method runs a system command (via the `load_license_xml()` private method) based on property values that are set in the License object. Using serialization it is possible to set these values to arbitrary values such that when get\_license\_info() is called it will run the command that was set when the object was deserialized.

***/opt/ibm/forensics/html/includes/license.inc.php:***

```
class License {
    private $license_util;
    private $license_file;

[...]

    private function load_license_xml($use_cache = true, $use_license_file = "") {
[...]

        if (is_file($lic_file)) {
            **$run_cmd = $this->license_util . ' ' . $lic_file;**
            $license_cmd_out = **$this->run_command($run_cmd, $retval, $output)**;

```

However, there is no direct path from a PHP [magic method](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php) to the `get_license_info()` method. Therefore the License object needs to be wrapped in another object.

It was found that the `simple_html_dom_node` can be abused to call [`call_user_func_array()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func-array.php) on user-supplied (deserialized) data. This PHP function can be passed an object and method of that object, which needs to be called. If we would pass it a License object and instruct it to call the `get_license_info()` method, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands. The `call_user_func_array()` is called from the `outertext()` method of the `simple_html_dom_node` class, which is amongst other locations called from the `__toString()` magic method.

By wrapping the `simple_html_dom_node` in a fake `dataset` class we can cause any of the chart classes to call the `__toString()` method, which will set of the POP chain. The full POP chain and proof of concept code are provided below.
