Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4462:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to an XML External Entity Injection (XXE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The core issue is the presence of an XXE vulnerability, which occurs when an application parses XML input containing references to external entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The specific impact is not detailed in the provided text. However, XXE vulnerabilities can lead to:
    *   **Confidentiality issues:** Disclosure of internal files, potentially containing sensitive data.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By referencing external entities that are very large or slow to retrieve, it's possible to cause a denial of service.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker can make the server request and retrieve resources from internal servers, or external resources using the application server as a proxy.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the processing of maliciously crafted XML data containing external entity references.
*   An attacker can manipulate XML input to inject malicious external entity declarations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide or influence the XML input that is parsed by the affected applications,
    * No additional capabilities/position details were specified.
