| InfoSphere Information Server, Information Server on Cloud | 11.7.1.1 and earlier 11.7 releases |
| InfoSphere Information Server, Information Server on Cloud | 11.5 |
| InfoSphere Information Server | 11.3 |

## Workarounds and Mitigations

**Installations using WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment**

1. Change directory to <WAS Install location>/AppServer/profiles/<profile name>/config/cells/<cell name>/applications/isf-servlets.ear/deployments/isf-servlets/isf-servlets.war/WEB-INF

     The default profile name is InfoSphere.

2. Open the web.xml file in an editor.

3. Within the security-constraint section

     a. Locate lines that match the following url-pattern

               <url-pattern>/javahttp/checked/\*</url-pattern>

     b. Remove **/checked** to change the line to

               <url-pattern>/javahttp/\*</url-pattern>

4. Add a new security-constraint after the existing security constraints:

     **<security-constraint>**

**<web-resource-collection>**

**<web-resource-name>Public</web-resource-name>**

**<description>No Authorization resources</description>**

**<url-pattern>/javahttp/unchecked/\*</url-pattern>**

**</web-resource-collection>**

**</security-constraint>**

5. Save the updated file.

6. Restart WAS.

**Note**: If you have a clustered environment, you can:

                  a. repeat the same steps for the deployment manager and all members of the cluster   --or--

                  b. perform the steps on the deployment manager and run SyncNode (so web.xml on the nodes is updated)

           After all are updated, restart the deployment manager and the cluster.

**Installations using WebSphere Application Server** **Liberty**

1. Change directory to <Liberty install location>/wlp/usr/servers/iis/apps/isf

2. Extract isf-servlets.war using following command:

          **unzip isf-servlets.war**

3. Open the isf-servlets/WEB-INF/web.xml file in an editor

4. Within the security-constraint section

     a. Locate lines that match the following url-pattern

               <url-pattern>/javahttp/checked/\*</url-pattern>

     b. Remove **/checked** to change the line to

               <url-pattern>/javahttp/\*</url-pattern>

5. Add a new security-constraint after the existing security constraints:

     **<security-constraint>**

**<web-resource-collection>**

**<web-resource-name>Public</web-resource-name>**

**<description>No Authorization resources</description>**

**<url-pattern>/javahttp/unchecked/\*</url-pattern>**

**</web-resource-collection>**

**</security-constraint>**

6. Save the updated file.

7. Repackage the war file:

         a. Move the isf-servlets.war file to a backup location.

         b. Create the new isf-servlets.war file

                **zip -r isf-servlets.war isf-servlets/**

         c. Verify that the new isf-servlets.war file is created in <Liberty install location>/wlp/usr/servers/iis/apps/isf

8. Remove the isf-servlets folder.

9. Restart Liberty WebSphere.
