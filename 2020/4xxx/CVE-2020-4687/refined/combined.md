To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"

# Security Bulletin: IBM Content Navigator is susceptible to a sensitive data exposure.

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM Content Navigator has addressed the following vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2020-4687](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-4687)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| IBM Content Navigator | 3.0CD |

## Remediation/Fixes

| Product | VMRF | Remediation / First Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IBM Content Navigator | 3.0 Continuous Delivery | ICN 3.0.7 iFix 5 and above, ICN 3.0.8 iFix 1 and above. |

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Add parameter 'docParamsToIgnore' to the server configuration and put a value in it that is not a standard URL queryParameter (e.g 'mitigateCacheFlaw') This will prevent the default value of security\_token being used and therefore make the document caching user session specific again.

**Limitations of mitigation:**Â it will only work where docIdPrototype is ${originalDocURL} and not where it has been set to a subset of the URL parameters passed to enable ICN clearing of ViewONE cache for non-versioned documents (as in current versions of ICN).
