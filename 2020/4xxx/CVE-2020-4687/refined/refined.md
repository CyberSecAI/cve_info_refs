- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from how IBM Content Navigator handles document caching, where the `security_token` is used as a default value which could lead to multiple users sharing the same cache if the `docIdPrototype` is set to ${originalDocURL}, allowing access to potentially sensitive data.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive data exposure due to shared cache and potentially weak default value for document IDs when cached.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to cached documents, potentially exposing sensitive data to unintended users within the same session if docIdPrototype is set to ${originalDocURL}

- **Attack vectors:** An attacker within the same session as a victim user can potentially access cached documents if the docIdPrototype is set to ${originalDocURL}.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within the same user session as a user that has accessed a document that has been cached.
