Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4031:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly mentions CVE-2020-4031 and describes its nature as a use-after-free vulnerability in `gdi_SelectObject` within FreeRDP. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is a use-after-free condition occurring within the `gdi_SelectObject` function of FreeRDP. This means that after memory has been freed, a pointer to this memory is still used, leading to corruption, crashes, or potentially code execution.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   *   **Use-After-Free:** The core weakness is that after a memory block is deallocated, a pointer continues to reference it and is later used, leading to undefined behavior.
   *   The vulnerability is triggered when FreeRDP is used in compatibility mode with `/relax-order-checks` option.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   *   **Crash:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a crash of the FreeRDP client.
   *  **Potential Code Execution**: Although not explicitly stated, a use-after-free vulnerability can sometimes lead to arbitrary code execution, depending on how the memory is reused after it is freed.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   *   **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered when connecting to a malicious or compromised RDP server. The attacker can send a crafted stream of RDP commands which will lead to the vulnerability.
    *   The attack is triggered on the client side, meaning a malicious server is required for the exploitation.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   *   **Compromised RDP Server:** The attacker needs to have control over an RDP server.
    *  **Compatibility Mode with `/relax-order-checks`**: the target client needs to be using FreeRDP in compatibility mode with the `/relax-order-checks` option enabled.

**Summary of extracted information:**
