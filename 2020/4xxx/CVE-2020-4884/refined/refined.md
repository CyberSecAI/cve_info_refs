- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `AGENT RELAY CODESTATION.KEYSTORE.PASSWORD`, when manually edited, is stored in plain text and is not encrypted upon restart.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Storing sensitive information (keystore password) in plain text, leading to potential exposure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the plain text password could gain access to the keystore.
- **Attack vectors:** Access to the configuration file where the password is stored in plain text.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have access to the system where the configuration file containing the plain text password is stored. This could be through system access or other means that would allow reading the file.
