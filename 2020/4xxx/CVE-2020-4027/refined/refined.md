Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input in custom user macros, which allows for Velocity Template Injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Velocity Template Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious Velocity code into custom user macros. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to adequately sanitize or validate user-supplied input within custom user macros, which leads to the injection vulnerability.
- **Bypass of Mitigations:** The vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass existing mitigations for Velocity Template Injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the affected Confluence instance. This grants the attacker full control over the server, including access to sensitive data, and the ability to disrupt operations.
- **Compromise of Data:**  Attackers may gain access to sensitive data and customer information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Custom User Macros:** The vulnerability is triggered through the use of custom user macros, which are user-defined templates for content rendering.
- **Velocity Template Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious code via these macros.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **System Administration Permissions:** The attacker needs to have system administrator privileges in the Confluence instance to create and modify custom user macros.
- **Access to Confluence Instance:** The attacker needs network access to the Confluence instance to exploit the vulnerability.
