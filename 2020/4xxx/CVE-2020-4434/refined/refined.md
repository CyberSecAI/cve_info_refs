- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The provided text indicates that certain IBM Aspera applications have vulnerabilities that, based on product configuration and/or valid authentication, could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or perform a denial-of-service (DoS). However, it doesn't specify the root cause of the vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The weaknesses are unspecified, but the vulnerabilities allow for arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The text mentions that the vulnerabilities require "intimate knowledge of the system" and either specific product configurations or valid authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs "intimate knowledge of the system" and also to have either a specific configuration set, or valid authentication credentials.
