- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SD-WAN Orchestrator handles system parameters in an insecure way.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure handling of system parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated SD-WAN Orchestrator user with high privileges may be able to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based. An attacker exploits the vulnerability via the SD-WAN Orchestrator interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires an authenticated user with high privileges on the SD-WAN Orchestrator.
