Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the handling of the IIOP protocol. This leads to the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The core weakness is the deserialization of untrusted data, which allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects that can be executed by the application.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the data it receives over the IIOP protocol, allowing for the exploitation of the deserialization vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The code is executed in the context of the root user.
- **Complete System Compromise:**  The attacker gains the ability to potentially take complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- **IIOP Protocol:**  The attack is carried out through the manipulation of data sent over the IIOP protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send data to the server over the network.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any prior authentication.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker needs the ability to create malicious serialized objects which can be executed after deserialization.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to IBM by tint0 working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative and Kylinking of NSFOCUS Security Team
- Fixes are available via interim fix PH25074 or upgrading to fix pack 9.0.5.5 or 8.5.5.18 or later.
