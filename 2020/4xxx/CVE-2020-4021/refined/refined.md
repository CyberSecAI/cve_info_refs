Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input in the XML export view.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input when generating the XML export view, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the XML export view, which will be executed by the victim's browser when they access the view.
- Account Hijacking: The attacker could potentially steal sensitive information or user sessions by executing JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- Data Manipulation: An attacker may be able to modify data, or deface the affected application, by exploiting the XSS vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code in user-controlled fields that are included in the XML export.
- The victim needs to access the crafted XML export view to trigger the injected code

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the Jira application.
-  No special user privileges are explicitly mentioned as required for the attacker to inject code, suggesting that a low-privileged user or even an unauthenticated user might be able to achieve this, depending on the specific vulnerable input fields and permissions.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in the XML export view functionality of Jira Server and Data Center.
- The issue is labeled with `sxss` and `xss` tags.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a **Medium** CVSS score.
