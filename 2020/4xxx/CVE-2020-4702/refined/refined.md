Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-4702

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from two issues present in IBM InfoSphere Metadata Asset Manager:
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application's data store, which are then executed when other users view the affected data.
    - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** This allows an attacker to induce the server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources, potentially leading to data exposure or other malicious actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
    - **Stored XSS:** An attacker could potentially hijack user sessions, steal sensitive information (e.g. cookies, credentials), or perform actions on behalf of a victim user.
    - **SSRF:** An attacker could potentially access internal network resources that should not be accessible externally, scan internal infrastructure, or potentially read sensitive data from internal resources or external resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
    - **Stored XSS:** The attack vector is the application's functionality that allows users to store data without proper sanitization. This data can be manipulated by an attacker and then viewed by other users.
    - **SSRF:** The attack vector would be through an application feature that accepts and processes URLs or other resource identifiers, without proper validation, allowing to forge requests to arbitrary locations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    -  **Stored XSS:** An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious data into the application. This could be achieved by having an account with the required privileges or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain access.
   -  **SSRF:** An attacker must be able to influence the server's request generation to an arbitrary resource.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
    - IBM InfoSphere Information Server versions 11.7 and 11.5

**Remediation:**
  - Upgrade to a later release containing the fix.
  - Apply the security patches.
