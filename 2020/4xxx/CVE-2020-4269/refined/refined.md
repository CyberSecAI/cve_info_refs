  "CVE-2020-4269": {
    "description": "IBM QRadar SIEM contains hard-coded credentials.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `configservices` account in IBM QRadar SIEM is deployed with a default, hard-coded password.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of Hard-coded Credentials"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can use the default password to access configuration sets, download sensitive information like encrypted credentials and host tokens, and access other parts of QRadar using the retrieved host tokens.",
      "attack_vectors": "Remote access via the web interface by sending an HTTP request to the `/configuration` alias, authenticating with the default credentials for the `configservices` user.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the QRadar web interface and the ability to send HTTP requests.",
       "additional_details": "The configuration alias maps to the `/store/configservices/configurationsets` folder, which is protected using the `mod_authn_file` Apache Module, restricting access to the `configservices` user. The password, protected with the `crypt` algorithm, is the same across all QRadar installations. The default password is 'qradar'."
    },
    "affected_products": [
      "IBM QRadar 7.3.0 to 7.3.3 Patch 2"
    ],
     "remediation": "The issue is resolved in the following versions:\n- QRadar / QRM / QVM / QNI 7.4.0 GA\n- QRadar / QRM / QVM / QRIF / QNI 7.3.3 Patch 3\n- QRadar / QRM / QVM / QRIF / QNI 7.3.2 Patch 7\n- QRadar Incident Forensics 7.4.0",
