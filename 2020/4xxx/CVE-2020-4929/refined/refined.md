**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The specific location or mechanism that allows the injection of malicious scripts is not detailed in this document.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
*   Execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the victim's browser.
*   Potentially steal sensitive information such as session cookies.
*   Perform actions on behalf of the victim.
*   Deface web pages or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves injecting malicious script into the IBM QRadar SIEM application that can then be executed by other users' browsers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to find a way to inject malicious code into the QRadar system. The attacker is likely a malicious insider, has somehow obtained the ability to access the application, or found another vulnerability that allows them to place script. The document does not specify the mechanism by which an attacker could inject the XSS payload.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   IBM QRadar 7.3.0 to 7.3.3 Patch 7
*   IBM QRadar 7.4.0 to 7.4.2 Patch 2
