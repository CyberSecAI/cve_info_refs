- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not invalidate the validation cookie when the user logs out from the application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to invalidate session cookies upon logout.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially reuse the session cookie of a logged-out user to gain unauthorized access to the application.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially intercept or obtain a session cookie of a logged-out user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid session cookie, which could be done through various methods such as network interception, or stealing the cookie from the victim's device.
