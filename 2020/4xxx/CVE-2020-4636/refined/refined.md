- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A privileged user could inject malicious commands through Python3 scripting using the `sys` module in a beta version of IBM Resilient.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unsanitized input in Python3 scripting, allowing command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Execution of arbitrary commands by a privileged user.
- **Attack vectors**: Through Python3 scripting functionality within the IBM Resilient platform.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a privileged user within the IBM Resilient platform.
