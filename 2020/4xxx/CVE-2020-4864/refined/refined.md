- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the X-Forwarded-For header. The system logs the IP address from the X-Forwarded-For header, which can be easily spoofed by an attacker.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the application trusts and logs the IP address provided in the X-Forwarded-For header without proper validation, allowing for IP spoofing.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can provide a spoofed source IP address, potentially masking their location. The impact is limited to logging inaccurate information, not compromising the system directly.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a request with a manipulated X-Forwarded-For header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on a restricted internal network and able to send network requests to the Resilient OnPrem server.
