Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-4885

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a race condition via a symbolic link in IBM Db2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Race Condition:** A race condition exists that allows a local user to potentially manipulate the system's state during a critical time window.
*   **Symbolic Link Manipulation:**  The race condition is exploited via a symbolic link, likely allowing the attacker to redirect file operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Configuration Change:** A local user could access and change the configuration of DB2.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure, Data Modification, or Denial of Service (DoS)**: As mentioned in the NetApp advisory, successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities (including CVE-2020-4885) could potentially lead to sensitive information disclosure, addition or modification of data, or DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user.
*   **Symbolic Link:** The attack involves the use of a symbolic link to manipulate file access during the race condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User:** The attacker must have local access to the affected system.
*   **Ability to Create Symbolic Links:** The attacker must be able to create and manipulate symbolic links within the system.
*   **Timing Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create the necessary conditions for the race condition to occur.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   IBM Db2 V11.5 on Linux and Unix platforms. Windows is not affected.
*   NetApp products that incorporate IBM DB2 versions 9.7, 10.1, 10.5, 11.1, and 11.5

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was found by Eddie Zhu, BEIJING DBSEC TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.
* IBM provides a special build/interim fix for this issue, which can be downloaded from Fix Central.
* NetApp states they are aware of the public discussion of this vulnerability, but no fixes are available at the time of the advisory, but they will be made available via the NetApp support website.
