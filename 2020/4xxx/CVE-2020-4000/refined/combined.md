##### **3.c Default passwords Pass-the-Hash Attack (CVE-2020-4001**

**Description**

The SD-WAN Orchestrator has default passwords allowing for a Pass-the-Hash Attack. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [moderate severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html).

**Known Attack Vectors:**

SD-WAN Orchestrator ships with default passwords for predefined accounts which may lead to to a Pass-the-Hash attack.
Note: The same salt is used in conjunction with the default password of predefined accounts on freshly installed systems allowing for for Pass-the-Hash-Attacks. That same system could be accessed by an attacker using the default password for the predefined account.

**Resolution:**

To remediate CVE-2020-4001, change the default passwords of the preconfigured accounts on SD-WAN Orchestrator before production use.

**Workarounds:**

None

**Additional Documentation:**

None.
