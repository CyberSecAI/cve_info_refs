- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Cloud Pak for Security (CP4S) fails to set the HTTPOnly flag for cookies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing HTTPOnly flag on cookies. This allows access to cookie data via client side scripting.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could potentially obtain sensitive information from the cookies.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attacker can potentially use cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks to extract the cookie information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute malicious scripts on the victim's browser, potentially via XSS.
