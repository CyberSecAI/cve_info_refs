- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the IBM Spectrum Scale GUI that allows an unauthorized user to execute commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is insufficient access control or authorization checks within the IBM Spectrum Scale GUI, allowing command execution by unauthorized users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, potentially leading to complete compromise, data breaches, or disruption of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the IBM Spectrum Scale GUI. An attacker needs to find a way to interact with the GUI without proper authorization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the IBM Spectrum Scale GUI. This implies either local network access or remote access through a network connection. The attacker does not need to have legitimate user credentials.
