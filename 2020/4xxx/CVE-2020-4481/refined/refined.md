- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack due to how it processes HTTP properties.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XXE vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows extraction of files from the server host.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting the processing of HTTP properties.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to send requests that manipulate the vulnerable HTTP properties.
