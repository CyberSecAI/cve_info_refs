- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Untrusted search path vulnerability in the Atlassian Companion App.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application uses an untrusted search path when executing `cmd.exe`. This allows a malicious executable placed in a directory that is part of the search path to be executed instead of the intended `cmd.exe`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local attackers can execute arbitrary code by having the vulnerable app run a malicious executable.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attackers can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious executable in a directory that is part of the search path. The attacker also needs to have the vulnerable Atlassian Companion App installed and be able to trigger the vulnerable code path.
