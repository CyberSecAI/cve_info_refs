Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4409:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to reverse tabnabbing in IBM Maximo Asset Management.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reverse tabnabbing: This occurs when a malicious link in one tab is able to modify the window object of the previously opened tab, potentially redirecting the user to a malicious site when they return to it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially redirect users to malicious websites.
- This can lead to phishing attacks, credential theft, and malware installation.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to inject a malicious link into an IBM Maximo Asset Management page, which opens in a new tab.
- When the user returns to the original tab, the attacker-controlled new tab can potentially modify the original tab.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious links into the application or have the ability to control URLs on the application.
- The attacker may also need to have some form of privileged access within the application depending on the injection point.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- IBM Maximo Asset Management versions 7.6.0 and 7.6.1 (and potentially older versions)
- Multiple IBM Industry Solutions and Control Desk products are also affected when using the affected core versions.
