You can remove a USB controller from the virtual machine if you do not want to connect to USB devices.

## Prerequisites

Note: The
ESXi host supports hot-removal of a USB controller. You can remove a USB controller from a virtual machine when both the
ESXi host and the guest operating system of the virtual machine support the hot-removal functionality.

To make sure that the guest operating system of the virtual machine supports the hot-removal functionality, refer to the vendors documentation.

* Verify that the USB controller is not in use.
* Verify that all USB devices are disconnected from the virtual machine.
* Required privilege: Virtual Machine.Configuration.Add or Remove Device

## Procedure

1. Navigate to and select a data center, folder, cluster, resource pool, host, or vApp, click the VMs tab and click Virtual Machines. Alternatively, you can navigate to and select directly the virtual machine.
2. Right-click a virtual machine and click Edit Settings.
3. On the Virtual Hardware tab, move the pointer over the USB controller and click the Remove icon.
4. Click OK to confirm the deletion and close the dialog box.

## Results

The controller is no longer connected to the virtual machine, but remains available to add at a later time.

**Parent topic:**
[USB Configuration from a Client Computer to a Virtual Machine](GUID-800DA713-FB5F-49AF-9045-F21915AB79C8.html "You can add multiple USB devices to a virtual machine when the physical devices connect to a client computer on which the vSphere Web Client is running. The vSphere Web Client must be logged in to an instance of vCenter Server that manages the ESXi host where the virtual machines reside. USB passthrough technology supports adding multiple USB devices, such as security dongles, mass storage devices, and smartcard readers to virtual machines.")

ESXi670-202010002 addresses the following issues:

OpenSLP as used in ESXi has a use-after-free issue. This issue might allow a malicious actor with network access to port 427 on an ESXi host to trigger a use-after-free in the OpenSLP service resulting in remote code execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier [CVE-2020-3992](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3992) to this issue. For more information, see VMware Security Advisory [VMSA-2020-0023.1](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0023.html).

VMware ESXi contains a use-after-free vulnerability in the XHCI USB controller. A malicious actor with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine might exploit this issue to execute code as the virtual machine's VMX process running on the host. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier [CVE-2020-4004](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-4004) to this issue. For more information, see [VMSA-2020-0026](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0026.html).

VMware ESXi contains a privilege-escalation vulnerability that exists in the way certain system calls are being managed. A malicious actor with privileges within the VMX process only, might escalate their privileges on the affected system. Successful exploitation of this issue is only possible when chained with another vulnerability. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier [CVE-2020-4005](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-4005) to this issue.

### Bring-up Known Issues

* **Cloud Foundation Builder VM deployment fails with the "[Admin/Root] password does not meet standards" message**

  When configuring the Cloud Foundation Builder admin and root passwords, the format restrictions are not validated. As a result, you can create a password that does not meet the requirements and the Cloud Foundation Builder VM deployment will fail.

  Workaround: When configuring the Cloud Foundation Builder, ensure that the password meets the following restrictions:

  + Minimum eight characters long
  + Must include at least one uppercase letter
  + Must include at least one lowercase letter
  + Must include at least one digit
  + Must include at least one special character
* **The Cloud Foundation Builder VM remains locked after more than 15 minutes.**

  The VMware Imaging Appliance (VIA) locks out the user after three unsuccessful login attempts. Normally, the lockout is reset after fifteen minutes but the underlying Cloud Foundation Builder VM does not automatically reset.

  Workaround: Using SSH, log in as admin to the Cloud Foundation Builder VM, then switch to the `root` user. Unlock the account by resetting the password of the admin user with the following command.

  `pam_tally2 --user=<user> --reset`
* **The bring-up process fails at task stop TLS 1.0 on the vRealize Log Insight nodes**

  The bring-up fails at the task stop TLS 1.0 on the vRealize Log Insight nodes with the following error `Connect to 10.0.0.17:9543 [/10.0.0.17] failed: Connection refused (Connection refused)`. This issue has been observed in the slow environments after restarting a vRealize Log Insight node. The node does not start correctly and its API is not reachable.

  Workaround: Use the following procedure to work around this issue.

  1. Restart the failed bring-up execution in the Cloud Foundation Builder VM and open the bring-up logs.

     This will retry the failed the bring-up task which might still fail on the initial attempt. The log shows an unsuccessful connection to the vRealize Log Insight node.
  2. While bring-up is still running, use SSH to log in to the vRealize Log Insight node that is shown as failed in the bring-up log.
  3. Run the following command to determine the connection issue.

     `loginsight-node-2:~ # service loginsight status`

     It should confirm that the daemon is not running.
  4. Execute the following command:

     `loginsight-node-2:~ # mv /storage/core/loginsight/cidata/cassandra/data/system ~/cassandra_keyspace_files`
  5. Reboot the vRealize Log Insight node.
  6. Confirm that it is running.

     `loginsight-node-2:~ # uptime`

     `18:25pm up 0:02, 1 user, load average: 3.16, 1.07, 0.39`

     `loginsight-node-2:~ # service loginsight status`

     `Log Insight is running.`

  In a few minutes, the bring-up process should successfully establish a connection to the vRealize Log Insight node and proceed.

### Upgrade Known Issues

* **The vRealize Automation upgrade reports the "Precheck Execution Failure : Make sure the latest version of VMware Tools is installed" message**

  The vRealize Automation IaaS VMs must have the same version of VMware Tools as the ESXi hosts on which the VMs reside.

  Workaround: Upgrade VMware Tools on the vRealize Automation IaaS VMs.
* **Error upgrading vRealize Automation**

  Under certain circumstances, upgrading vRealize Automation may fail with a message similar to:

  ```
  An automated upgrade has failed. Manual intervention is required.
  vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager Pre-upgrade checks for vRealize Automation have failed:
  vRealize Automation Validations : iaasms1.rainpole.local : RebootPending : Check if reboot is pending : Reboot the machine.
  vRealize Automation Validations : iaasms2.rainpole.local : RebootPending : Check if reboot is pending : Reboot the machine.
  Please retry the upgrade once the upgrade is available again.
  ```

  1. Log-in into the first VM listed in the error message using RDP or the VMware Remote Console.
  2. Reboot the VM.
  3. Wait 5 minutes after the login screen of the VM appears.
  4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the next VM listed in the error message.
  5. Once you have restarted all the VMs listed in the error message, retry the vRealize Automation upgrade.
* **When there is no associated workload domain to vRealize Automation, the VRA VM NODES CONSISTENCY CHECK upgrade precheck fails**

  This upgrade precheck compares the content in the logical inventory on the SDDC Manager and the content in the vRealize Lifecycle Manager environment. When there is no associated workload domain, the vRealize Lifecycle Manager environment does not contain information about the `iaasagent1.rainpole.local` and `iaasagent2.rainpole.local` nodes. Therefore the check fails.

  Workaround: None. You can safely ignore a failed `VRA VM NODES CONSISTENCY CHECK` during the upgrade precheck. The upgrade will succeed even with this error.
* **NSX Data Center for vSphere upgrade fails with the message "Host Prep remediation failed"**

  After addressing the issue, the NSX Data Center for vSphere bundle no longer appears as an available update.

  Workaround: To complete the upgrade, manually enable the anti-affinity rules.

  1. Log in to the management vCenter Server using the vSphere Client.
  2. Click **Menu > Hosts and Clusters** and select the cluster on which host prep remediation failed (for example SDDC-Cluster1).
  3. Click **Configure > Configuration > VM/Host Rules**.
  4. Select **NSX Controller Anti-Affinity Rule** and click **Edit**.
  5. Select **Enable rule** and click **OK**.

  This completes the NSX Data Center for vSphere upgrade.
* **Lifecycle Management displays fatal error**

  When the user password in the `/opt/vmware/vcf/lcm/lcm-app/conf/application.properties` file contains a backslash (\), Lifecycle Manager does not start and displays the fatal error `Password authentication failed for user lcm`.

  Workaround: Follow the steps below to resolve the error:

  1. SSH to the SDDC Manager VM.
  2. Type `su` to switch to root user.
  3. Open the `/opt/vmware/vcf/lcm/lcm-app/conf/application.properties` file, remove all backslashes (\) from the `lcm.datasource.password` field, and save the file.
  4. Run the command `systemctl restart lcm-db`.
* **Task panel does not show correct upgrade tasks for NSX-T workload domain upgrades**

  When you upgrade NSX-T workload domains. the task panel does not show upgrade status correctly. This is a UI issue only and there is no impact on the upgrade workflow.

  Monitor upgrade status by navigating to the Update/Patches tab of the relevant workload domain:

  1. On the SDDC Manager Dashboard, click *Inventory* -> *Workload Domains*.
  2. In the Domain column, click the appropriate workload domain name.
  3. Click the *Update/Patches* tab.
  4. Monitor upgrade status.
* **Exception displayed when a scheduled NSX-T upgrade begins during an idle SDDC Manager session**

  When a scheduled NSX-T upgrade begins during an idle SDDC Manager session, the following UI exception is displayed: Retrieving NSXT upgrade failed with unknown exception

  This is a UI issue only. There is no impact on the upgrade workflow.

  Refresh the web browser.

### vRealize Suite Known Issues

* **vRealize Operations Manager: VMware Security Advisory VMSA-2021-0018**

  [VMSA-2021-0018](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0018.html) describes security vulnerabilities that affect VMware Cloud Foundation.

  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains an arbitrary file read vulnerability. A malicious actor with administrative access to vRealize Operations Manager API can read any arbitrary file on server leading to information disclosure.The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22022 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API has insecure object reference vulnerability. A malicious actor with administrative access to vRealize Operations Manager API may be able to modify other users information leading to an account takeover.The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22023 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains an arbitrary log-file read vulnerability. An unauthenticated malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can read any log file resulting in sensitive information disclosure. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22024 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains a broken access control vulnerability leading to unauthenticated API access. An unauthenticated malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can add new nodes to existing vROps cluster. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22025 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains a Server Side Request Forgery in multiple end points. An unauthenticated malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can perform a Server Side Request Forgery attack leading to information disclosure. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifiers CVE-2021-22026 and CVE-2021-22027 to this issue.

  Workaround: See [KB 85452](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/85452) for information about applying vRealize Operations Security Patches that resolve the issues.
* **The password update for vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager may run infinitely or may fail when the password contains special character "%"**

  Password management uses the vRealize Lifecycle Manager API to update the password of vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager. When there is special character "%" in either of SSH or API or Administrator credential types of the vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager users, then the vRealize Lifecycle Manager API hangs and doesn't respond to password management. There is a timeout of 5 mins and password management marks the operation as failed.

  Workaround:Retry the password update operation without the special character "%". Ensure that the passwords for all other vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager accounts don't contain the "%" special character.
* **vRealize Log Insight installation gets stuck due to incorrect MTU configuration**

  During deployment, Edge Service Gateways send frames with the MTU specified in the **Universal Distributed Logical Router - MTU Size** field in the deployment parameters file to the Top of Rack switches. If this MTU size is not configured correctly in your infrastructure, the vRealize Log Insight deployment may hang on an installation task after the `Apply vRealize Log Insight License` task.

  If any of these tasks remain incomplete for more than 30 minutes. follow the workaround below.

  1. Fix the routing between the Edge-vTEP network and ESXi-vTEP network
  2. SSH to the Cloud Builder VM.
  3. Switch to root:
     + `sudo -i`
  1. Restart the bring-up service:

  **systemctl restart vcf-bringup**

  Wait five minutes to get all services online.

  Retry the bring-up process.

### Networking Known Issues

* **NSX Manager is not visible in the vSphere Web Client.**

  In addition to NSX Manager not being visible in the vSphere Web Client, the following error message displays in the NSX Home screen: "No NSX Managers available. Verify current user has role assigned on NSX Manager." This issue occurs when vCenter Server is not correctly configured for the account that is logged in.

  Workaround: To resolve this issue, follow the procedure detailed in Knowledge Base article 2080740 ["No NSX Managers available" error in the vSphere Web Client](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2080740).

### SDDC Manager Known Issues

* **Unable to delete VI workload domain enabled for vRealize Operations Manager from SDDC Manager.**

  Attempts to delete the vCenter adapter also fail, and return an SSL error.

  Workaround: Use the following procedure to resolve this issue.

  1. Create a vCenter adapter instance in vRealize Operations Manager, as described in [Configure a vCenter Adapter Instance in vRealize Operations Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Operations-Manager/7.5/com.vmware.vcom.config.doc/GUID-19DAD6AF-7262-4655-B69F-6C665E33B52F.html). This step is required because the existing adapter was deleted by the failed workload domain deletion.
  2. Follow the procedure described in [Knowledge Base article 56946](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/56946).
  3. Restart the failed VI workload domain deletion workflow from the SDDC Manager interface.
* **APIs for managing SDDC cannot be executed from the SDDC Manager Dashboard**

  You cannot use the API Explorer in the SDDC Manager Dashboard to execute the APIs for managing SDDC (`/v1/sddc`).

  Workaround: None. These APIs can only be executed using the Cloud Builder as the host.
* **SDDC Manager cannot manage the passwords for the NSX Edges and UDLR/DLR deployed to support application virtual networking**

  These passwords are not managed through the SDDC Manager Dashboard.

  Workaround: Refer to the NSX Data Center for vSphere documentation for information about how to update these passwords.

### Workload Domain Known Issues

* **Adding host fails when host is on a different VLAN**

  A host add operation can sometimes fail if the host is on a different VLAN.

  Workaround:

  1. Before adding the host, add a new portgroup to the VDS for that cluster.
  2. Tag the new portgroup with the VLAN ID of the host to be added.
  3. Add the Host. This workflow fails at the "Migrate host vmknics to dvs" operation.
  4. Locate the failed host in vCenter, and migrate the vmk0 of the host to the new portgroup you created in step 1. For more information, see [Migrate VMkernel Adapters to a vSphere Distributed Switch](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.networking.doc/GUID-0DE237B8-1938-4DE9-90EC-718E345B56A0.html) in the vSphere product documentation.
  5. Retry the Add Host operation.

  **NOTE**: If you later remove this host in the future, you must manually remove the portgroup as well if it is not being used by any other host.
* **NSX Manager for VI workload domain is not displayed in vCenter**

  Although NFS-based VI workload domains are created successfully, the NSX Manager VM is not registered in vCenter Server and is not displayed in vCenter.

  Workaround: To resolve this issue, use the following procedure:

  1. Log in to NSX Manager (http://<nsxmanager IP>).
  2. Navigate to **Manage > NSX Management Service**.
  3. Un-register the lookup service and vCenter, then re-register.
  4. Close the browser and log in to vCenter.
* **A vCenter Server on which certificates have been rotated is not accessible from a Horizon workload domain**

  VMware Cloud Foundation does not support the certificate rotation on the Horizon workload domains.

  Workaround: See KB article [70956](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/70956).
* **Deploying partner services on an NSX-T workload domain displays an error**

  Deploying partner services on an NSX-T workload domain such as McAfee or Trend displays the “Configure NSX at cluster level to deploy Service VM” error.

  Workaround: Attach the Transport node profile to the cluster and try deploying the partner service. After the service is deployed, detach the transport node profile from the cluster.
* **If the witness ESXi version does not match with the host ESXi version in the cluster, vSAN cluster partition may occur**

  vSAN stretch cluster workflow does not check the ESXi version of the witness host. If the witness ESXi version does not match the host version in the cluster, then vSAN cluster partition may happen.

  Workaround:

  1. Upgrade the witness host manually with the matching ESXi version using the vCenter VUM functionality.
  2. Replace or deploy the witness appliance matching with the ESXi version.
* **vSAN partition and critical alerts are generated when the witness MTU is not set to 9000**

  If the MTU of the witness switch in the witness appliance is not set to 9000, the vSAN stretch cluster partition may occur.

  Workaround: Set the MTU of the witness switch in the witness appliance to 9000 MTU.
* **The certificate rotate operation on the second NSX-T domain fails**

  Certificate rotation works on the first NSX-T workload domain in your environment, but fails on all subsequent NSX-T workload domains.

  Workaround: None
* **Operations on NSX-T workload domains fails if their host FQDNs include uppercase letters**

  If the FQDNs of ESXi hosts in an NSX-T workload domain include uppercase letters, then the following operations may fail for the workload domain:

  + Add a host
  + Remove a host
  + Add a cluster
  + Remove a cluster
  + Delete the workload domain

  Workaround: See [KB 76553](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/76553).
* **Creating an NSX-T workload domain fails on the task "Add management domain vCenter as compute manager"**

  This can happen if a previous attempt to create an NSX-T workload domain failed and Cloud Foundation was unable to clean up after the failed task.

  Workaround: Manually remove the NSX-T Data Center extension from the management vCenter Server and try to create the NSX-T workload domain again. See [Remove NSX-T Data Center Extension from vCenter Server](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.5/administration/GUID-E6E2F017-1106-48C5-ABCA-3D3E9130A863.html).
* **VI workload domain creation or expansion operations fail**

  If there is a mismatch between the letter case (upper or lower) of an ESXi host's FQDN and the FQDN used when the host was commissioned, then workload domain creation and expansion may fail.

  Workaround: ESXi hosts should have lower case FQDNs and should be commissioned using lower case FQDNs.
* **Cluster is deleted even if VMs are up and running on the cluster**

  When you delete a cluster, it gets deleted even if there are VMs running on the cluster. This includes critical VMs such as Edge VMs, which may prevent you from accessing your environment after the cluster gets deleted.

  Workaround: Migrate the VMs to a different cluster before deleting the cluster.
* **Workload domain operations fail if cluster upgrade is in progress**

  Workload domain operations cannot be performed if one or more clusters are being upgraded. The UI does not block such oeprations during an upgrade.

  Workaround: Do not perform any operations on the workload domain when a cluster upgrade is in progress.

### Security Operations Known Issues

* **Addition of members from PKS UAA to Harbor library fails when the certificate verification is enabled**

  This issue occurs when Harbor does not honor the certificate chain under **System Settings** > **Registry Root Certificate**.

  Workaround:

  1. SSH into the SDDC Manager VM as the `vcf` user.
  2. Run the following command. Make sure to update the password of the **admin** user and the Harbor URL: `curl -k -H'Content-type: application/json' -u admin:"< >" -XPUT https://harbor.vrack.vsphere.local/api/configurations -d '{"uaa_verify_cert":"false"}'`

  Harbor is in the UAA authentication mode and it uses members from PKS UAA.

  To create a user in UAA:

  1. Connect through SSH to Ops Manager appliance
  2. Run the following:

  `uaac target https://pks.vrack.vsphere.local:8443 --skip-ssl-validation`

  `uaac token client get admin`

  `uaac user add <<user-name> > --emails <<email> >`

### Multi-Instance Management Known Issues

* **Federation creation information not displayed if you leave the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard**

  Federation creation progress is displayed on the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard. If you navigate to another screen and then return to the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard, progress messages are not displayed. Instead, an empty map with no Cloud Foundation instances are displayed until the federation is created.

  Workaround: Stay on the Multi-Instance Dashboard till the task is complete. If you have navigated away, wait for around 20 minutes and then return to the dashboard by which time the operation should have completed.
* **The federation creation progress is not displayed**

  While federation creation is in progress, the SDDC manager UI displays the progress on the multi-site page. If you navigate into any other screen and come back to the multi-site screen, the progress messages are not displayed. An empty map with no VMware Cloud Foundation instances is displayed until the federation creation process completes.

  Workaround: None
* **Multi-Instance Management Dashboard operation fails**

  After a controller joins or leaves a federation, Kafka is restarted on all controllers in the federation. It can take up to 15 minutes for the federation to stabilize. Any operations performed on the dashboard during this time may fail.

  Workaround: Re-try the operation.

### API Known Issues

* **Unversionsed APIs are not Supported**

  Unversioned APIs in Cloud Foundation have been deprecated.

  Use Cloud Foundation public APIs.

To make sure that the guest operating system of the virtual machine supports the hot-removal functionality, refer to the vendors documentation.

* Verify that the USB controller is not in use.
* Verify that all USB devices are disconnected from the virtual machine.
* Required Privilege: Virtual Machine.Configuration.Add or Remove Device

## Procedure

1. Navigate to a data center, folder, cluster, resource pool, host, or vApp, click the VMs tab and click Virtual Machines.
2. Right-click a virtual machine and click Edit Settings.
3. On the Virtual Hardware tab, move the pointer over the USB controller and click the Remove icon.
4. Click OK to confirm the deletion and close the dialog box.

## Results

The controller is no longer connected to the virtual machine, but remains available to add at a later time.

**Parent topic:**
[USB Configuration from a Client Computer to a Virtual Machine](GUID-800DA713-FB5F-49AF-9045-F21915AB79C8.html "You can add multiple USB devices to a virtual machine when the physical devices are connected to the client computer on which you run the vSphere Client. The vSphere Client must be logged in to a vCenter Server instance that manages the ESXi host where the virtual machine resides. USB passthrough technology supports adding multiple USB devices, such as security dongles, mass storage devices, and smartcard readers to virtual machines.")
