- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) when the Distributed Front End (DFE) is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  An authenticated user could impersonate another user. This is due to improper handling of user authentication when DFE is enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user could gain unauthorized access to resources and actions associated with another user account. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves an authenticated user exploiting the DFE functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) system and the server must have the Distributed Front End (DFE) enabled.
