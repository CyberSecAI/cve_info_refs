- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A hard-coded cryptographic key is included in one of the binary files of IBM Verify Gateway. This key is passed as an argument to an encryption function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hard-coded cryptographic key, which can be extracted from the binary.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The extracted key can be used to compromise the encryption process within the IBM Verify Gateway. The specific impact of the vulnerability is not detailed, but it could lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other security breaches, depending on how the key is used.
- **Attack vectors**: Access to the vulnerable binary file is required to extract the cryptographic key. The specific method to extract the key from the binary file is not provided.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs access to the affected binary file.
