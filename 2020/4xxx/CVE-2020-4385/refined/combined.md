# Security Bulletin: IBM Verify Gateway does not hide a cryptographic key in one of its binary files (CVE-2020-4385)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

In one of the binary files distributed with the IBM Verify Gateway (IVG) components, it's possible to locate a hard-coded cryptographic key that's passed as an argument to an encryption function. As of v1.0.1 of IVG for RADIUS and IVG for AIX PAM, and v1.0.2 of IVG for Linux PAM and IVG for Windows Login, this cryptographic key is hidden from view.
