## Workarounds and Mitigations

Disabling the LDAP authentication cache will prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. The LDAP authentication cache can be disabled by setting the authentication cache minutes to 0 by running the following command on the CLI:

chldap -authcacheminutes 0

This setting can only be changed via the CLI by a user with the SecurityAdmin role.

Disabling the authentication cache will cause all logins and any CLI commands that modify the system configuration to authenticate individually with the LDAP server, causing an increase in load on the LDAP servers which may lead to command line processing delays. CLI commands that view the state of the system are not affected.

For this reason we recommend reenabling the authentication cache after upgrading to a code level containing a fix for this vulnerability, which can be done by running the following command on the CLI:

chldap -authcacheminutes 10

This will set the authentication cache time back to the default value of 10 minutes.
