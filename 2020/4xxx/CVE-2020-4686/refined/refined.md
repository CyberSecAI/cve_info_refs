- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the LDAP authentication mechanism of the affected IBM products. The specific nature of the flaw is not detailed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is related to the LDAP authentication process. The document specifically mentions the LDAP authentication cache as a weakness.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The document doesn't explicitly state the impact but implies that a successful exploit could compromise the authentication process. By exploiting this vulnerability an attacker may be able to bypass the normal authentication procedures. Disabling the cache can lead to increased load on LDAP servers.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the LDAP authentication mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The document does not specify the required attacker capabilities/position.

The document provides a workaround by disabling the LDAP authentication cache, which mitigates the vulnerability but may cause performance issues due to increased load on LDAP servers. The recommended solution is to upgrade to a code level that contains a fix for the vulnerability.
