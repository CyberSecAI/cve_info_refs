# Plugin archive directory traversal

Low

[adamreese](/adamreese)
published
GHSA-qq3j-xp49-j73f
Jun 15, 2020

## Package

Helm

## Affected versions

3.0.0-3.2.3

## Patched versions

3.2.4

## Description

The Helm core maintainers have identified an information disclosure

vulnerability in Helm 3.0.0-3.2.3.

### Impact

A traversal attack is possible when installing Helm plugins from a tar

archive over HTTP. It is possible for a malicious plugin author to inject a relative

path into a plugin archive, and copy a file outside of the intended directory.

Traversal Attacks are a form of a Directory Traversal that can be exploited by

extracting files from an archive. The premise of the Directory Traversal

vulnerability is that an attacker can gain access to parts of the file system

outside of the target folder in which they should reside. The attacker can

then overwrite executable files and either invoke them remotely or wait for

the system or user to call them, thus achieving Remote Command Execution on

the victim's machine. The vulnerability can also cause damage by overwriting

configuration files or other sensitive resources, and can be exploited on both

client (user) machines and servers.

<https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability>

### Patches

This issue has been fixed in Helm 3.2.4

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [the Helm repository](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues)
* For security-specific issues, email us at cncf-helm-security@lists.cncf.io

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2020-4053
