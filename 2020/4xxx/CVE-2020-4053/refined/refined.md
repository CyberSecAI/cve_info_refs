Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4053:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal flaw in Helm's HTTP plugin installer. Specifically, when installing plugins from a tar archive over HTTP, a malicious plugin author could inject relative paths into the archive. This allows them to write files outside of the intended plugin directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal issue. By crafting a malicious archive with relative paths (e.g., `../`), an attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem.
- **Inadequate Path Validation:** The original code lacked proper validation of file paths extracted from plugin archives. It did not prevent paths containing ".." or absolute paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially read sensitive files by placing symbolic links within the plugin to point outside the target directory or overwrite configuration files
- **Remote Command Execution:** By overwriting executable files, an attacker could potentially achieve remote command execution, either directly or by waiting for a system or user to invoke the overwritten executable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Plugin Archive:** The primary attack vector is a malicious plugin archive containing files with crafted relative paths designed to overwrite files outside of plugin directory.
- **HTTP Plugin Installation:** The vulnerability is triggered during the installation of a plugin via HTTP using the Helm client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Plugin Author:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious Helm plugin archive.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs a way to host the malicious plugin archive for a user to install it via the Helm client over HTTP.
- **Target User Action:** The target user needs to attempt to install the malicious plugin archive via Helm.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix for this vulnerability is implemented in Helm version 3.2.4, which includes improved path validation in the `cleanJoin` function to prevent directory traversal attacks. This function checks for illegal characters like ":" , ".." paths and absolute paths. Additionally, the `SecureJoin` function from the `cyphar/filepath-securejoin` library is used for more robust path sanitization.
- The vulnerability is described as having a "Low" severity.
- The vulnerability is present in Helm versions 3.0.0 through 3.2.3 and is resolved in 3.2.4.
- The issue was discovered by snoopysecurity.
- The vulnerability was assigned the CVE ID CVE-2020-4053.
