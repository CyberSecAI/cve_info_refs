- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A cross-site request forgery vulnerability exists in IBM InfoSphere Information Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact of the vulnerability is not explicitly specified in the document. However, CSRF vulnerabilities typically allow an attacker to induce victims to perform unwanted actions in the context of an application they are already authenticated with.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable via cross-site request forgery.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to induce a user of the affected application to unwittingly send a malicious request to the server. This typically involves tricking the user via a malicious website or email.
