Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4044:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `xrdp-sesman` service. This occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling incoming data on port 3350. Specifically, a large payload can overflow a buffer during the receive operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Insecure Handling of Network Data:** The `xrdp-sesman` service doesn't properly validate the size of incoming data, allowing a malicious client to send a large payload exceeding the buffer's capacity, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can send a crafted payload to crash the `xrdp-sesman` service. This disrupts the availability of the service.
*   **Privilege Escalation/Impersonation:** After crashing `xrdp-sesman`, an unprivileged local attacker can start their own rogue `sesman` service on port 3350. This malicious service can then:
    *   Capture user credentials submitted via XRDP.
    *   Approve or reject arbitrary login attempts.
    *   Hijack existing `xorgxrdp` sessions.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Due to the nature of buffer overflows, there's a possibility that the attacker could inject malicious code into the process memory. This may allow arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the `xrdp-sesman` service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack occurs over the network on TCP port 3350, which the `xrdp-sesman` service listens on.
*   **Local:** An attacker must have local access to the server in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the server's TCP port 3350 where the vulnerable `xrdp-sesman` service is listening.
*   **Local Access (Post-DoS):**  After crashing `xrdp-sesman` an attacker must have local access to the server in order to start their own rogue `sesman` service on the same port.

**Additional Details (from provided content):**

*   **Affected Versions:** XRDP versions up to and including 0.9.13 are affected.
*   **Patched Versions:**  The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.9.13.1 and later.
*   **Exploit:** A Python proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit has been created and provided which demonstrates how to crash the service by sending a large payload.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix involved adding a check for the maximum message size (`SCP_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`), effectively preventing the buffer overflow.
*   **Affected Products**: Multiple SUSE products, including SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and OpenSUSE are affected. Patches were released for various versions and service packs. Debian LTS and stable were also affected.
