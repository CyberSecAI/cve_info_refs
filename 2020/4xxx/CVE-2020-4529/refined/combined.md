Please consult the [Product Coexistence Matrix](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20Maximo%20Asset%20Management/page/Product%20compatibility) for a list of supported product combinations.

## Remediation/Fixes

Since IBM Maximo Asset Management version 7.6.0.4, we added the feature of non-applet printing, and a property where applet printing is disabled by default. To remediate this vulnerability, do not use applet printing. To verify that applet printing is disabled, please follow the steps listed in the Workarounds/Mitigations section.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

There is a configuration that can stop the usage of applets when performing direct print:
1.  Log in to Maximo and go to System Properties
2.  Filter for mxe.report.directprint.useapplet
3.  Set the value for that property to 0
4.  Do a Live Refresh of the property value
