Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-4788:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in the speculative execution behavior of IBM Power9 processors. These processors may speculatively operate on data stored in the L1 cache before the data has been fully validated. This is related to a way-prediction mechanism in the processor's design.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Speculative Execution:** The primary vulnerability is that the processor may speculatively execute instructions using data that is not yet validated. This can lead to an attacker influencing the execution flow.
*   **Incomplete Data Validation:** The processor may start executing operations based on L1 cache data before validation is complete, creating an opportunity for exploitation.
*   **Bypassing Security Measures:** While hardware and software security measures exist to prevent the leakage of protected data, an attacker can induce the operating system to speculatively execute instructions with attacker-controlled data. This can potentially bypass "kernel user access prevention" techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure (Limited):** The primary impact is a potential breach of data confidentiality. An attacker with a local account could potentially infer memory contents by measuring the timing access of the speculative execution.
*   **Speculative Bypassing:** The vulnerability allows for the possibility of speculatively bypassing security mechanisms, potentially paving the way for further exploitation via other vulnerabilities or side-channel attacks.
*   **Arbitrary Kernel Code Execution (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, the ability to speculatively execute attacker controlled instructions may lead to this under certain conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires a local account on the target system, where the attacker can execute code and measure the timing of operations.
*   **Manipulation of Data in L1 Cache:** The attacker needs to control data that the operating system will speculatively use, which is resident in the L1 cache.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Account:** The attacker must have a local account on the system with the ability to execute code.
*   **Ability to Control Data:** The attacker must have a way to control the data the system will speculatively operate on.
*   **Timing Measurements:** The attacker needs to measure the timing of execution to infer memory contents through side-channel effects.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability can be mitigated by flushing the L1 cache between privilege boundaries. Patches have been released by IBM for AIX and VIOS, and also by Linux kernel developers.
*   **Performance Impact of Mitigation:** Flushing the L1 cache can have a slight performance impact. However, tests indicate that the impact can be minimal for some workloads.
*   **Fixes:** Fixes involve flushing L1 cache between privilege boundaries.
*   **Acknowledgements:** The vulnerability was discovered by Anthony Steinhauser of Google's Safeside Project.
*   **Affected products:** AIX and VIOS, and Linux Kernel.
*   **CVSS Score:** The CVSS score will be available at the IBM X-Force link.

**Summary of relevant information:**
This vulnerability is a speculative execution issue affecting IBM Power9 processors where an attacker can use controlled data to induce speculative execution and potentially leak information by measuring the timing of the execution. Mitigation involves flushing the L1 cache, and fixes are available for multiple affected systems.
