Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform discloses error messages that could potentially aid an attacker in formulating future attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is due to the disclosure of potentially sensitive information within error messages. This information could be used by an attacker to understand the application's inner workings, identify vulnerabilities, and refine attack strategies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could enable an attacker to gain deeper knowledge of the system, thereby increasing the effectiveness of subsequent attacks. The disclosed information can help attackers in reconnaissance and the planning of further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the application's error messages. An attacker would need to interact with the application in a manner that triggers these error messages, likely by providing invalid input or causing exceptional conditions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to have some access to the application to be able to trigger and observe the error messages. This could potentially include a network connection to the TRIRIGA application or direct access via a web interface or API.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability affects IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform versions 3.6.1 and 3.5.3.
* Fixes are available in versions 3.6.1.1 and 3.5.3.8, respectively.
* No workarounds or mitigations are available.
