Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-4470:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue within the IBM Spectrum Protect Plus administrative console when installing a plugin. Specifically, it allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to a directory writable by the administrator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of file paths during the plugin installation process. This enables an attacker to specify a path outside the intended directory, leading to file upload to arbitrary locations.
*   **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated, remote attacker.
*  **Arbitrary File Upload:**  The system allows for the upload of files with arbitrary content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious RPM package containing scriptlets, the attacker can achieve remote code execution with root privileges on the IBM SPP appliance.
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite/Creation:**  An attacker can upload and write arbitrary files to locations accessible to the administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends specially crafted HTTP requests to the target IBM SPP server.
*   **RPM Package:** The attacker crafts a malicious RPM package containing executable content. This package is then uploaded to the target system through the exploited vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the target IBM SPP server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the file upload vulnerability.
*  **HTTP server:** The attacker needs a publicly accessible server to host the malicious RPM package for the target to download.

**Additional Information**

*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) script, which demonstrates the attack by uploading and installing a malicious RPM package, resulting in command execution on the target system.
* The vulnerability is fixed in IBM Spectrum Protect Plus version 10.1.6.
