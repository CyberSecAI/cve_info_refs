- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not invalidate sessions immediately after logout.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session handling issue, specifically lack of immediate session invalidation upon logout.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to a valid token from a previous authenticated session could potentially obtain sensitive information from that session.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to have access to a valid session token of a logged-out user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid session token of a logged-out user and must have the capability to use this token to access the system.
