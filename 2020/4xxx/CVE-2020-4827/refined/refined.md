- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially perform actions on behalf of a legitimate user without their consent.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted request sent to the vulnerable application, triggered by a user's browser session. This requires the attacker to lure a logged-in user to visit a malicious page or click a malicious link, which in turn executes the forged request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in user to unknowingly trigger a crafted request. This could be done through a malicious website, email or other methods. The attacker does not require any prior knowledge of user credentials, other than that the victim is logged in.
