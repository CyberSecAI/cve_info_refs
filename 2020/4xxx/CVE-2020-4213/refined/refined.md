Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-4213:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings within the Administrative Console Framework service of IBM Spectrum Protect Plus. Specifically, the `username` parameter is not sanitized before being used in a system call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The vulnerability allows attackers to inject arbitrary commands into a system call due to insufficient input validation.
- Improper Input Validation: The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, particularly the username parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- Privilege Escalation: The attacker can execute code in the context of an administrator, gaining elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, over a network.
- Network Access: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, indicating that a network-based attack is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated attacker: No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- Network connectivity to the vulnerable service: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected IBM Spectrum Protect Plus service.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is located within the Administrative Console Framework service when processing the username parameter.
- IBM has released a patch to address this issue (10.1.5 patch1 for Linux).
- The vulnerability was reported to IBM by KPC and sulfur, both working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
