- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the application's susceptibility to DLL hijacking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software is vulnerable to DLL hijacking attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact of exploitation is not detailed in this document but a DLL hijacking vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution by an attacker.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through DLL hijacking.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location that the application will load from. The document doesn't specify if local or remote access is required to achieve this.
