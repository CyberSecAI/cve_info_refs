- **Root cause of vulnerability:** ISIQ session identifiers are not properly invalidated upon user logout from ISIQ's web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session identifiers are not invalidated after logout, leading to session hijacking opportunities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can hijack a user session token.
- **Attack vectors:** By exploiting the lack of session invalidation after logout.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to obtain a valid, unexpired session token, likely from a previous session that was not properly invalidated.
