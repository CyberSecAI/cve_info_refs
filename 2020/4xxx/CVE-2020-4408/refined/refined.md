- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM QRadar Advisor with Watson App does not properly mask passwords during input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate password masking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Passwords could be obtained by a physical attacker nearby.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the system where the passwords are being entered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be physically nearby while a user enters passwords into the application.
