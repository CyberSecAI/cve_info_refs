        "impact": "An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim user by renaming a file to include malicious script. This could lead to cookie theft or other malicious activities. Additionally, they can bypass the file extension restrictions and upload files with unsafe extensions, potentially leading to remote code execution.",

They can also exploit a filename manipulation vulnerability in the rename process to bypass file extension restrictions and upload/execute malicious files such as php scripts",
