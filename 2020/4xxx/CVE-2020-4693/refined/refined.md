- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of data prior to export.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Code injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability exists due to improper validation of data during the export process in IBM Spectrum Protect Operations Center, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious code into the export.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the data export process with crafted malicious input.
