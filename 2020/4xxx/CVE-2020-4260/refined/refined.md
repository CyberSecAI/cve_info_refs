- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a flaw in IBM UrbanCode Deploy that allows a user with special permissions to obtain sensitive information through generic processes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the potential to reveal secure properties via generic processes due to insufficient access controls on these processes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting the generic processes within IBM UrbanCode Deploy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires special permissions within the IBM UrbanCode Deploy system to exploit the vulnerability.
