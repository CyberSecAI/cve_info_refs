Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a failure to invalidate user login sessions promptly upon timeout. This means a session might remain active even after the user's inactivity period has expired.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Session Management:** The core weakness is in the improper handling of HTTP session timeouts. The system doesn't reliably terminate sessions when they should expire.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** If a session is not invalidated promptly, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the system by intercepting or hijacking a timed-out session. This is possible if the attacker can access the user's system or network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially take over a timed-out session if it hasn't been properly invalidated. This could happen if the attacker gains access to the user's machine, network, or browser.
*   **Override Logout Timeout:** For the ACH service, it's specified that an attacker could possibly intercept and override the logout timeout, which can lead to session hijacking.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access/Access to User's System**: An attacker would need to be able to intercept or gain access to the user's machine, network, or browser where the session was initiated to potentially hijack a session that has timed out but not invalidated.
*  **Override Logout Timeout:** For the ACH service an attacker with appropriate network position could possibly intercept and override the logout timeout.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **No product change:** The provided information indicates that the fix for this vulnerability does not require a product change. Instead, the workaround is to configure the `com.ibm.ws.security.web.logoutOnHTTPSessionExpire` property in WebSphere Application Server, specifically for the ACH services.
*   **Multiple Products Affected:** This vulnerability affects multiple products within the IBM Financial Transaction Manager suite, including Corporate Payment Services, Digital Payments, High Value Payments, ACH Services and Check Services.
*   **Workaround:** The workaround involves configuring HTTP session logout timeout settings in WebSphere Application Server.
