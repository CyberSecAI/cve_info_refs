# Security Bulletin: Financial Transaction Manager for ACH Services is affected by a potential logout session timeout (CVE-2020-4555)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Login session may not be invalidated in a timely manner on timeout.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2020-4555](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-4555)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| Financial Transaction Manager for ACH Services for Multi-Platform | 3.1.0 |
| Financial Transaction Manager for ACH Services for Multi-Platform | 3.0.6 |

## Remediation/Fixes

| Product | VRMF | Issue | Remediation / First Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FTM ACH | 3.1.0.0 - 3.1.0.4 | 100530 | To be filled in |
| FTM ACH | 3.0.6.0 - 3.0.6.11 | 100530 | To be filled in |

## Workarounds and Mitigations

HTTP session logout timeout
When the browser HTTP session for a Control Center user times out, the user is logged out. However, someone can possibly intercept and override the logout timeout. To avoid this override, configure the com.ibm.ws.security.web.logoutOnHTTPSessionExpire property in WebSphere Application Server. For more information about this property, see the WebSphere Application Server documentation.
