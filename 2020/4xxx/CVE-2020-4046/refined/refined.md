Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4046:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper handling of unfiltered HTML within the embed block of the WordPress block editor. This allows users with low privileges to inject malicious HTML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a type of XSS where malicious JavaScript code can be injected into web pages.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The embed block in the WordPress editor does not properly sanitize user input, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Script Execution:** When an affected post with malicious HTML is viewed by a higher privileged user (e.g., administrator), the injected JavaScript code is executed within the user's browser context. This could lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session cookies, gaining access to the user's account.
    *   **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive data visible to the user.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can redirect the user to malicious websites or download malware.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability can potentially allow an attacker to escalate privileges on the affected WordPress site, if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Embed Block:** Attackers exploit the embed block feature in the WordPress block editor.
*   **Malicious HTML Injection:** Attackers inject malicious HTML code, including JavaScript, within the embed block.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **WordPress Account:** The attacker needs to have a WordPress account with low privileges (e.g., contributor or author).
*   **Access to Block Editor:** The attacker needs access to the WordPress block editor to insert the malicious HTML.
*   **Target User Interaction:** The malicious code is executed when a higher privileged user views the affected post.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects WordPress versions 5.4.1 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was patched in WordPress 5.4.2, along with fixes in older versions (5.3.4, 5.2.7, 5.1.6, 5.0.10, 4.9.15, 4.8.14, 4.7.18, 4.6.19, 4.5.22, 4.4.23, 4.3.24, 4.2.28, 4.1.31, 4.0.31, 3.9.32, 3.8.34, 3.7.34).
*   The vulnerability is an authenticated XSS vulnerability.
*   The issue was discovered by Sam Thomas (jazzy2fives).
