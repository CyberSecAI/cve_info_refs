    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2020-4051",
      "Description": "The Dijit Editor's LinkDialog plugin of dojo 1.14.0 to 1.14.7 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks."
    },
    "Analysis": [
      {
        "source": "github.com_f7f93954_20250119_111745.html",
        "Root cause": "The Dijit Editor's LinkDialog plugin does not properly filter user-provided input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
        ],
        "Impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the link description field, which can be executed when a user views the content, potentially leading to information disclosure or other malicious activities.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "The user input for link description."
        ],
         "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to input data into the Dijit Editor's LinkDialog description field."

        "source": "github.com_31ecc21b_20250119_111744.html",
         "Root cause": "The `LinkDialog.js` plugin for Dojo's Dijit Editor was vulnerable to XSS due to lack of HTML filtering in the link description field.",
         "Weaknesses": [
           "Cross-site scripting (XSS) due to unsanitized user input"
        ],
        "Impact": "Malicious HTML could be injected into the link description field which will then be rendered by the editor.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "Manipulating the 'textInput' value in the LinkDialog plugin to contain malicious HTML."
        ],
         "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be able to use the Dijit Editor and manipulate the link creation functionality."
