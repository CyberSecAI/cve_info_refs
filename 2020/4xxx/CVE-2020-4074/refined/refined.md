Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4074:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the authentication system of PrestaShop versions prior to 1.7.6.6. The core issue is that the system did not properly validate the session, allowing attackers to bypass authentication checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The system failed to adequately verify the user's session, leading to a bypass of security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access. Specifically, the application was not properly validating the session token and user ID stored in the cookie against a server-side session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to admin accounts.
*   **Command Execution:**  With admin access, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the affected system, leading to a complete compromise of the e-commerce platform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Foreign Request:** An attacker could craft malicious requests to execute admin commands, exploiting the inadequate session validation.
*   **Session Hijacking:** While not explicitly stated, the lack of proper session validation implies the possibility of hijacking a valid user's session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the PrestaShop instance.
*   **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to understand how to exploit the flawed authentication system and potentially craft malicious requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves introducing a session validation mechanism which checks the session ID and token stored in the cookie against a server-side session, ensuring that the user ID in the cookie matches the session's user ID.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by a user named "komradz86", who was credited by the PrestaShop team for the finding.
*   A workaround was proposed to enable `PS_COOKIE_CHECKIP` configuration. However, this was noted as potentially not being enough to fully mitigate the vulnerability.

**Technical Details from Code Diff:**

*   **classes/Cookie.php:** This file was modified to include logic for managing sessions, including methods for `registerSession`, `deleteSession`, `isSessionAlive`, and `getSession`. These methods store and validate session information.
*   **classes/Customer.php and classes/Employee.php:** These files were modified to include a check for `isSessionAlive` when validating if a user is logged in.
*   **classes/CustomerSession.php and classes/EmployeeSession.php:** These new files implement the `SessionInterface` and define the session structures for customers and employees respectively.
*   **install-dev/data/db\_structure.sql and install-dev/upgrade/sql/1.7.6.6.sql:** These files were updated to include the new database tables for storing session information for customers and employees.
*   **controllers/admin/AdminLoginController.php:** The `processLogin` function was modified to call the `registerSession` method to create a new session for authenticated employees.

In summary, CVE-2020-4074 describes an improper authentication vulnerability in PrestaShop which could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized admin access by bypassing session validation checks. The patch introduces a proper session management mechanism, which includes server-side session storage and validation.
