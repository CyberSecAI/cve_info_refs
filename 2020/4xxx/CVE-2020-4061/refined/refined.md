Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-4061:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of HTML content when pasting into the Froala rich text editor within the October CMS backend. Specifically, the Froala editor's method of handling pasted content, combined with a bypass in the browser's sanitization, allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Sanitization:** The core issue is that the Froala editor, while attempting to sanitize pasted HTML, fails to properly neutralize malicious payloads. This is exacerbated by a browser-level sanitization bypass.
*   **Self-XSS:** The vulnerability is classified as a self-XSS, meaning the malicious script is executed within the user's own browser session as a result of their own actions (copying and pasting).
*   **Browser Sanitizer Bypass:** The vulnerability leverages the fact that browsers might not sanitize all malicious HTML elements correctly in combination with the Froala's own sanitizer.
*   **Regex and String Processing Vulnerability:** The Froala editor uses regular expressions and string manipulation to process HTML, which is error-prone, leading to a bypass. In this specific case, it's related to how `<noscript>` tags are handled and replaced before parsing by DOMParser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation results in the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser session. This could lead to:
    *   **Data theft:** Sensitive information such as cookies or session tokens could be stolen.
    *   **Session hijacking:** An attacker could potentially hijack the user's session.
    *   **Malicious actions:** The attacker could potentially perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Copy and Paste:** The primary attack vector involves a user copying malicious HTML content from a compromised or malicious website and pasting it into a Froala editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious Website:** The attacker needs to host or control a website containing malicious HTML content that will be copied by the victim.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must visit the malicious website, copy the crafted HTML content and then paste it into the Froala rich text editor in October CMS.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability was discovered in Froala's sanitization logic. The Froala editor attempts to replace `<noscript>` tags with a placeholder before parsing, but it fails to handle nested `<noscript>` tags correctly within the title attribute of a `<u>` tag. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code like `<img src onerror=alert(1)>` by crafting HTML that bypasses Froala's flawed regex and string-based sanitization process.

October CMS addresses the issue by implementing additional sanitization logic with the `ocSanitize` function that removes attributes starting with `on` and attributes with a value starting with `javascript:`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content references a blog post from research.securitum.com which describes various copy/paste vulnerabilities across browsers and WYSIWYG editors, including the one affecting Froala.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Low" severity because it requires the user to copy malicious content into the editor, effectively making it a self-XSS.
*   The fix involves sanitizing HTML content before it is processed by Froala. This is done by adding a `beforeCleanupPaste` event handler to the Froala editor that calls the `ocSanitize` function.
