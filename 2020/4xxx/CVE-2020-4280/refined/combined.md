## Abstract

A Java deserialization vulnerability exists in the QRadar RemoteJavaScript Servlet. An authenticated user can call one of the vulnerable methods and cause the Servlet to deserialize arbitrary objects.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted (serialized) object, which amongst other things can result in a denial of service, change of system settings, or execution of arbitrary code.

## Introduction

[QRadar](https://www.ibm.com/security/security-intelligence/qradar) is IBM's enterprise [SIEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management) solution. A free version of QRadar is available that is known as [QRadar Community Edition](https://developer.ibm.com/qradar/ce/). This version is limited to 50 events per second and 5,000 network flows a minute, supports apps, but is based on a smaller footprint for non-enterprise use.

A Java [deserialization vulnerability](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A8-Insecure_Deserialization) exists in the QRadar RemoteJavaScript Servlet. This Servlet contains a custom [JSON-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC) implementation (based on JSON-RPC version 1.0). Certain methods accept base64 encoded serialized Java objects. No checks have been implemented to prevent deserialization of arbitrary objects. Consequently, an authenticated user can call one of the affected methods and cause the RemoteJavaScript Servlet to deserialize arbitrary objects.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted (serialized) object, which amongst other things can result in a denial of service, change of system settings, or execution of arbitrary code.

## Details

The RemoteJavaScript Servlet is only accessible for authenticated users. It is mapped to the following URLs:

* /remoteJavaScript
* /remoteMethod
* /JSON-RPC
* /JSON-RPC/\*

The JSON data can be passed via the URL query string or as POST data. The JSON data should contain a field named `method`, which contains the name of the application and the method that needs to be invoked. The requested application is looked up in the *Application Registry*. Each application has a mapping XML file located under `/opt/qradar/conf/appconfig/` named `<appname>-exported_methods.xml`, which is essentially a list of all (Java) methods that can be called including their associated Java class, access control, and other settings.

When the application is found (and licensed), a call is made to `getExportedMethod()` to lookup the Java method that needs to be invoked. After some additional checks - like authorization - the Servlet will eventually invoke the `call()` method of the found Java method. If present, arguments are passed as a String array to the call() method. These arguments are then converted into the correct type using the `com.q1labs.core.shared.util.ReflectionUtils.stringsToObjects()` method.

***com.q1labs.uiframeworks.application.ExportedMethod:***

```
public abstract class ExportedMethod extends AllowableObject {

[...]

	public Object call(PageContext pageContext, String... passedArguments) throws Exception {
		if (passedArguments != null && passedArguments.length != 0) {
			if (this.log.isDebugEnabled()) {
				this.log.debug("Calling with passed in arguments: " + Arrays.toString(passedArguments));
			}

			return this.call(pageContext, this.stringsToObjects(passedArguments));

[...]

	private Object[] stringsToObjects(String[] paramaters) throws ExportedMethodException {
		return ReflectionUtils.stringsToObjects(this.getParameterTypes(), paramaters);
	}

```

The parameter types differ per method and are provided via the `getParameterTypes()` method. If the parameter type is a 'simple' type, it will be converted without deserialization. However, some methods also accept complex types, which are passed as serialized objects.

***com.q1labs.core.shared.util.ReflectionUtils:***

```
public class ReflectionUtils {
	public static Object stringToObject(Class type, String param) throws NoSuchMethodException, InvocationTargetException, InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException {
		long i;
		int i;
		if (type.isPrimitive()) {
			if (type.equals(Integer.TYPE)) {
				if (param == null) {
					param = "0";
				}

				i = (new Double(param)).longValue();
				if (i > 2147483647L) {
					i = 0L - (2147483647L - i);
				}

				return (int)i;
			} else if (type.equals(Character.TYPE)) {
				return param.charAt(0);
			} else if (type.equals(Double.TYPE)) {
				return new Double(param);
[...]
			} else {
				throw new RuntimeException("Unknown primitive type: " + type.getName());
			}
		} else if (param != null && !param.equalsIgnoreCase("$_NULL_$")) {
			if (type.equals(Short.class)) {
				i = (new Double(param)).intValue();
				if (i > 32767) {
					i = 0 - (32767 - i);
				}

				return (short)i;
[...]
			} else {
				return SerializationUtils.deserialize(Base64.decode(param));
			}
[...]
	}

	public static Object[] stringsToObjects(Class[] types, String... parameters) throws RuntimeException {
		Pattern arrayMatcher = Pattern.compile("^\\[(.+)\\]$");
		if (parameters != null && parameters.length > 0) {
			Object[] newArgs = new Object[types.length];

			for(int i = 0; i < types.length; ++i) {
			try {
				Class type = types[ i ];
				if (!type.isArray()) {
					newArgs[ i ] = stringToObject(type, parameters[ i ]);
[...]

```

Deserialization of objects is done using the `org.apache.commons.lang3.SerializationUtils` class. This class doesn't perform any checks on the objects that are deserialized. Since no checks are done in the RemoteJavaScript Servlet it can be abused to deserialize arbitrary objects. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted (serialized) object.

## Proof of concept

The JSON-RPC interface already contains a method that allows running of arbitrary commands (as the `nobody` user). This method is named `qradar.executeCommand` and can be called by any user, no special privileges are required. However, the method checks if the property `console.enableExecuteCommand` exists and is set to `true`. By default this property doesn't exist and thus it is not possible to call this method to run arbitrary commands. By utilizing the deserialization vulnerability it is possible to create this property, after which it is possible to use qradar.executeCommand to run arbitrary commands.

***com.q1labs.qradar.ui.qradarservices.UIQRadarServices:***

```
public static Object executeCommand(PageContext pageContext, String command, int timeoutSeconds) throws Exception {
	if (!"true".equalsIgnoreCase(QSystem.getProperty("console.enableExecuteCommand"))) {
		throw new Exception("Cannot execute remote system commands");
	} else {
		File qradarDir = new File(NVAReader.getProperty("NVA", "/opt/qradar"));
		Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[]{"/bin/sh", "-c", command}, (String[])null, qradarDir);
[...]

```

One of the methods that can be used to trigger a deserialization operation is the method `qradar.validateChangesAssetConfiguration`. This method is mapped to the Java method `com.q1labs.assetprofilerconfiguration.ui.util.AssetProfilerConfig.validateChangesAssetConfiguration()`. The method takes one argument of the type `java.util.List`.

The proof of concept uses a Jython *gadget*. The Jython Java library is present in the Servlet's class path and consequently we can deserialize objects found in this library. The [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) payload generation tool already contains a [gadget](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/payloads/Jython1.java) that uses the Jython library. ysoserial's payload will first write a Python file to the target system, after which the file is executed. The payload has been modified to directly create the target property (`console.enableExecuteCommand`) without the need to write a file to disk first. The payload is modified to execute the following Python code (upon deserialization):

```
eval("__import__('com.q1labs.frameworks.util.QSystem', globals(), locals(), ['setProperty'], 0).setProperty('console.enableExecuteCommand', 'true')")

```

Security Data in QRadar SIEM is added as Log Sources, which listen for data from or connect to remote
sources
to collect events. Each log source has a corresponding Device Support Module (DSM) that parses and
normalizes events for 400+ devices. Users on QRadar Community Edition 7.5.0 and later require a larger
footprint to run
QRadar Community Edition, but have access to all of the same DSMs and protocols as enterprise customers.
Several log source types can auto discover in QRadar by DSM type or event format, such as LEEF, JSON,
CEF, or Name Value Pair (NVP). Users can launch the Log Source Management (LSM) app to manually add or
modify log sources in QRadar.

1. Review the [QRadar
   Supported DSMs list](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.5?topic=configuration-qradar-supported-dsms).
2. Run a QRadar automatic update to get the latest DSMs and Protocols.
3. Use the [Log
   Source Management app](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.5?topic=configuring-qradar-log-source-management-app) to add or configure your log sources that do not auto discover.
4. Advanced. Use the [DSM
   Editor](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/qsip/7.5?topic=administration-event-data-processing-in-qradar) to create your own Log Source Type.

QRadar Community Edition FAQ
**Who can download QRadar Community Edition?**

QRadar Community Edition is a free version of our enterprise QRadar SIEM that is provided without
warranty or support. Users can download a 3-month license that can be extended each quarter to
continue using Community Edition. QRadar Community Edition offers students, developers,
security teams, or small organizations the option to use QRadar under a limited license. As
QRadar SIEM is subject to export restrictions, some users are not able to download the software
where the United States Export Administration Regulations (EAR) has declared a restriction.

**Is the QRadar Community Edition free of charge?**

Yes, QRadar Community Edition is available to users at no cost and is provided as-is without
warranty or support.

**Can I upgrade QRadar Community Edition?**

QRadar Community Edition is based off of our enterprise QRadar SIEM (Classic) release of QRadar
7.5.0 Update Package 10. Users who have entitlement to IBM Fix Central through work or your
corporate account have access to download an SFS that can be used to upgrade your version.
Students, app developers, or security enthusiasts who download QRadar Community Edition would
not have access, so QRadar Community Edition is not considered as an upgradeable version for
non-enterprise users.

* Access to IBM Fix Central: If yes, and you have access to IBM Fix Central and entitlement to
  QRadar SIEM, you can upgrade to the latest version with an Upgrade Package (SFS file) and
  then apply the QRadar Community Edition license file from this website.
* Access to IBM Fix Central: No. Users who want to upgrade to a newer version can install the
  latest ISO file to flatten their existing installation of QRadar Community Edition.

**Can I renew my license for QRadar Community Edition?**

Users who have installed QRadar Community Edition where the 3-month license has expired can
return to this site and download the latest key file. You are not required to reinstall or
upgrade to the latest QRadar Community Edition and can apply the latest key to extend your
current install. As QRadar Community Edition is a non-warranted product and offered as-is, you
as the downloader are the responsible party for your network and software security. IBM
recommends that users upgrade to the latest version when new ISOs are posted for QRadar
Community Edition.

* Access to IBM Fix Central: If yes, and you have access to IBM Fix Central and entitlement to
  QRadar SIEM, you can upgrade to the latest version with an Upgrade Package (SFS file) and
  then apply the QRadar Community Edition license file from this website.
* Access to IBM Fix Central: No. Users who want to upgrade to a newer version can install the
  latest ISO file to flatten their existing installation of QRadar Community Edition.

**Can I install other appliance or managed host types?**

QRadar Community Edition includes a license that is intended for users to install QRadar as an
All-in-One Console appliance. The installation menu in the installer allows users to select
other appliance types or use the ISO file to install managed hosts and connect them to the
Console. Users can install an App Host appliance as it does not require an EPS license. However,
other appliance types you attached to the Console will experience license issues after the
initial license expires.

* QRadar Console
* App Host appliance

**Is there support for QRadar Community Edition?**

No. QRadar Community Edition is provided without warranty or support assistance. Users who
require assistance can discuss QRadar Community Edition in the forums, but QRadar Support does
not take support cases or tickets on QRadar Community Edition from any users. Entitled users
with support contacts who use QRadar Community Edition in a lab environment should not open
cases.

QRadar Support Technical Notes

**What is the operating systems for QRadar Community Edition?**

Red Hat Enterprise 8.8 (Ootpa) is the operating system (OS) that runs QRadar Community Edition.

**Can I install QRadar Community Edition on a Cloud provider?**

QRadar Community Edition is intended to be deployed on a VM or physical hardware. Users can
deploy QRadar Community Edition on Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud, but there are
no marketplace images available at this time for these platforms. When the enterprise version of
QRadar SIEM is released, there is typically a marketplace image to streamline the installation
process for full product users. However, these versions do not exist for QRadar Community
Edition, so any installation types on a cloud provided would be a custom install type and might
not install as expected.

QRadar Reddit (/r/QRadar)

IBM Community Forums

**How long is the QRadar Community Edition license valid?**

The QRadar Community Edition license is provided in 3-month intervals. Each quarter, IBM will
publish an updated license file where users can extend their QRadar Community Edition license
for another 3 months. License files are retrieved from the same location as the ISO and users
can upload a .key file to extend their QRadar Community Edition experience.

**Are there features offered in QRadar Community Edition that is provided in the paid enterprise
product?**

The release of QRadar Community Edition is limited by the license type provided. Users cannot
install other managed host types

**Are automatic updates available in QRadar Community Edition?**

Yes, daily and weeekly auto updates are provided to users on QRadar Community Edition. As
protocols, device support modules (DSMs), QRadar identifiers (QID map), and scanner modules are
released, these are received by QRadar Community Edition installations that have network
visibility to **https://auto-update.qradar.ibmcloud.com/**. If you have a proxy
enabled in your lab environment or strict firewall blocking, you might be required to update
your rules to allow the auto update.

**Can I download and install apps from the X-Force App Exchange?**

QRadar Community Edition users can install any applications from the X-Force App Exchange.
Applications can use anywhere from 200MB to 2GB or RAM based on the app capabilities, such as
Machine Learning. Administrators might not be able to install applications that exceed the
default 10% of RAM allocated to the Console. Users who install at 24GB of RAM have 2.4GB of RAM
allocated to run applications or content such as rules, dashboards, searches, or custom
properties added through QRadar content packs.
