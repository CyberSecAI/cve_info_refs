{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization of user-supplied content within the Java deserialization function in IBM QRadar SIEM. The RemoteJavaScript Servlet deserializes arbitrary Java objects without proper validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Lack of input validation on serialized objects"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary command execution, denial of service, and modification of system settings.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted, serialized Java objects via the RemoteJavaScript Servlet, which can be accessed through URLs like `/remoteJavaScript`, `/remoteMethod`, `/JSON-RPC`, and `/JSON-RPC/*`.",
        "The JSON data containing the malicious serialized object can be passed via URL query strings or as POST data."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the QRadar system. No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability."
