- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Session not invalidated after logout in ISAR iOS App.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Failure to properly invalidate user sessions upon logout.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Potentially allows unauthorized access if a session is not terminated after logout. The specific impact is not detailed, but could allow an attacker to use the session if they have access to the device/network after the user logs out.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability resides in the ISAR iOS App.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker would need access to the device or network after a user has logged out of the app, but before the session expires or is otherwise invalidated, to reuse the session.
