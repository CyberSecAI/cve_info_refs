- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists because the product's owner was determined by the product configuration request object, which can be intercepted and modified by an attacker.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control, insecure object handling.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a product by modifying the owner value in a configuration request.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack by intercepting and modifying a product configuration request object.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic related to product configuration requests. They need to be able to modify the request object to change the owner value.
