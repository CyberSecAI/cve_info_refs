- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Certain users can run auto-configure/compare on resources without execute permission.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insufficient access control allows users to perform auto-configure/compare operations on resources even without the required execute permission.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to perform actions on resources they shouldn't be able to, potentially leading to configuration changes or information disclosure. The exact impact would depend on the specifics of the `auto-configure/compare` functionality in IBM UrbanCode Deploy.
- **Attack vectors:**  Attack vector is through the applicationâ€™s user interface or API when initiating `auto-configure/compare` operations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a valid user of IBM UrbanCode Deploy, but is not required to have execute permissions on the target resource.
