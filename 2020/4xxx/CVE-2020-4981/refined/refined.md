- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insecure external command execution within IBM Spectrum Scale CSI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure external command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability could allow insecure external command execution. The specific impact of this is not detailed, but this type of vulnerability often leads to arbitrary code execution on the affected system with the privileges of the vulnerable service.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vectors are not detailed, but the vulnerability exists within the IBM Spectrum Scale CSI component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The specific attacker capabilities or position needed are not detailed, but the attacker would likely need to be able to interact with the vulnerable CSI component.
