- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Data sent on RMI ports is not encrypted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unencrypted communication on RMI ports.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could eavesdrop on communications.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack by capturing traffic on RMI ports.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to eavesdrop on network traffic, indicating they need to be on the same network or have a presence on a network path where the unencrypted traffic is traversing.
