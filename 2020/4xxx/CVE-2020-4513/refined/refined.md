- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's session. This could lead to unauthorized actions, such as credential disclosure or manipulation of the application's functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the Web UI by embedding malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript code into the Web UI, likely through an input field or parameter. The attacker needs a valid user session for the malicious code to execute within that session's context.
