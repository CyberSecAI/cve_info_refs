Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-4482:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the "ADD SNAPSHOT STATUS REST CALL" not checking the user's role before adding a status to a snapshot. This lack of authorization check allows unauthorized users to potentially modify snapshot statuses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing Authorization Check: The primary weakness is the absence of proper authorization checks on the REST API endpoint responsible for adding snapshot statuses. This means that the system does not verify if the user making the call has the necessary permissions to perform the action.
- Privilege Escalation: This missing check could allow users with lower privileges to modify statuses, potentially affecting the system's integrity or control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Modification: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to modify the status of snapshots without proper authorization.
- Potential System Disruption: Tampering with statuses may lead to system disruption or make it difficult to track or manage deployments.

**Attack Vectors:**
- REST API Endpoint: The attack vector is the vulnerable REST API endpoint used to add snapshot statuses.
- Network Access: An attacker would need network access to reach the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable IBM UrbanCode Deploy instance.
- REST API Knowledge: They need a working knowledge of the REST API calls to exploit the vulnerability.
- Unauthorized User: The attacker would be an unauthorized user with insufficient privileges to modify snapshot statuses.
