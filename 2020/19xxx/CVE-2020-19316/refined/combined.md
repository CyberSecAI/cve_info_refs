## Trainings

#### Cyber Threat: Incident Response and Handling Training

Read more

Without a doubt, the sophistication and threats
caused by malicious attacks have continued to
increase at a rapid level. If you plan on
responding to a security incident, you must be
able to meet the challenges that these
sophisticated attackers present.
Instead of merely teaching a few hack attack
tricks, this course includes a time-tested, step-bystep
process for responding to computer
incidents; a detailed description of how attackers
undermine systems so you can prepare, detect,
and respond to them; and a hands-on workshop
for discovering holes before the bad guys do.
Additionally, the training explores the legal issues
associated with responding to computer attacks,
including employee monitoring, working with law
enforcement, and handling evidence.
This challenging training is particularly well suited
to individuals who lead or are a part of an
incident handling team. Furthermore, general
security practitioners, system administrators, and
security architects will benefit by understanding
how to design, build, and operate their systems
to prevent, detect, and respond to attacks.

#### Reverse Engineering and Malware Analysis

Read more

Reverse engineering and malware analysis are
vitally important skills for today's expert security
professional. Everything from reverse engineering
malware to discovering vulnerabilities in binaries
are required in order to properly secure an
organization from today's ever evolving threats.
In this training, you will gain the necessary malware
and unknown binary analysis skills to discover the
true nature of any malicious or unknown binary.
Malware analysis skills and steps will be taught to
help you on understanding malware analysis. After
learning these important introductory skills, you
will advance to the analysis of:

* ‣ Hostile Code & Malware, including: Worms,
  Viruses, Trojans, Rootkits and Bots.
* ‣ Malware behaviors analysis.

#### Network Security Pentesting and Exploitation

Read more

As cyber attacks increase, so does the demand for
information security professionals who possess
true network penetration testing and ethical
hacking skills. Network Security Pentesting and
Exploitation truly prepares you to conduct
successful penetration testing and ethical hacking
projects. The training starts with proper planning,
scoping and recon, and then dives deep into
scanning, target exploitation, password attacks
and web apps with detailed hands-on exercises
and practical tips for doing the job safely and
effectively.
You will finish up with an intensive, hands-on
Capture the Flag exercise in which you'll conduct
a penetration test against a sample target
organization, demonstrating the knowledge you
mastered in this training.

#### Reversing Android Applications and Malware

Read more

The ubiquity of the Android mobile platform and
growing threats to mobile applications calls for
increased vigilance on the part of organizations
analyzing Android malicious applications.
Malware author are aiming for users of Android
mobile operating system with a malicious
application that harvests personal information,
controlling the system and sends it to a remote
server. Thus, reversing Android malware is
interesting challenge to address.
In this training, we’ll focus on the static approach
to analyze Android malware. In this hands-on
course introduces audiences to the Android
application framework, architecture and how to
analyze and reverse engineer Android malware.
The audiences will gain the necessary reverse
engineering and binary analysis skills to discover
the true nature of any Android malware. The
audiences will learn how to recognize the high level language constructs (such as branching
statements, looping functions and network socket
code) critical to performing a thorough and
professional reverse engineering analysis of a
Android malware.
A significant portion of the course is dedicated to
lab exercises where students are provided the
opportunity to model attacks and perform
reverse engineering of real-life Android malware
samples.

#### Honeynet: Catching Suspicious Network Activities

Read more

A honeynet is a network set up with intentional
vulnerabilities; its purpose is to invite attack, so
that an attacker's activities and methods can be
studied and that information used to increase
network security. A honeynet contains one or
more honey pots, which are computer systems on
the Internet expressly set up to attract and "trap"
people who attempt to penetrate other people's
computer systems. Although the primary purpose
of a honeynet is to gather information about
attackers' methods and motives, the decoy
network can benefit its operator in other ways,
for example by diverting attackers from a real
network and its resources.
A complete background to the evolution of
honeypots followed by an introduction to the
Honeynet technologies, which will cover on
primary goals fpr using honeynet approach to
observe data flow and network analysis.
Extracting high interaction activity using Thug,
which will focus on web application centric
honeypot, analysis of attacks against low
interaction honeypots using Dionaea, using
honeypots for automated malware collection and
analysis, and an introduction to client honeypots.
Hopefully, with both informative and fun, aiming
to show you how honeypots can be used in the
real world to improve your information security.

#### Network Security Monitoring

Read more

Network security is not just about trying to build an impenetrable
wall that no attacker can breach. After all, experienced security
analysts know that there are no impenetrable walls, and a
determined attacker will get into a network eventually. Effective
network security requires not just preventing attacks, but
catching attackers as soon as they get through and keeping them
from getting to sensitive material. Network security monitoring is
the collection, analysis, and escalation of indications and
warnings in order to detect and respond to intrusions.
This training is your guide to deploying, building, and running a
network security monitoring operation, no prior experience
required. In addition, its focus on open source software and
vendor-neutral tools will help you to avoid costly and inflexible
solutions.

#### Web Application (In) Security

Read more

The Web Application Penetration Testing course from
**NetbyteSEC** is a totally hands-on learning experience. From the
first day to the last day, you will learn the ins and outs of Web
App Security and Pen Testing by attending lectures led by an
expert instructor. Every lecture is directly followed up by a
comprehensive lab exercises. Lab exercises consist of real-world
apps that demonstrate a vulnerability commonly found in a web
app.
You learn how to assess the app much as a black hat hacker
would, exploit the app so that you can demonstrate the true risk
of the vulnerability to the application owner. Finally, the lab will
follow up with remediation steps so that the application owner
can properly close down the security hole for good.

#### Pentesting with Metasploit

Read more

Penetration Testing with Metasploit is a training
course designed for network administrators and
security professionals who need to acquaint
themselves with the world mostly used of
offensive information security tool, Metasploit.
The Metasploit Framework makes discovering,
exploiting, and sharing vulnerabilities quick and
relatively painless. Pentesting With Metasploit
fills this gap by teaching you how to harness the
Framework, use its many features, and interact
with the vibrant community of Metasploit
contributors. Having mastered the essentials,
you'll move on to advanced penetration testing
techniques, including network reconnaissance
and enumeration, client-side attacks, devastating
wireless attacks, and targeted social engineering
attacks.
Pentesting With Metasploit will teach you how to:
