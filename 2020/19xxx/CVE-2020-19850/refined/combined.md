# Feature Request

About audited Directus version.

It has been cloned from suite repo.

Latest commit [directus/directus@1d151a9](https://github.com/directus/directus/commit/1d151a9034514e3f2ec1c80001e7c5fffdef2d4e)

### Description:

In a replay attack the attacker issues requests that are identical to the ones the user has sent. The application could not distinguish the original legitimate request from the malicious identical requests and will process them again. If HTTPS encryption is in place while call sent to the REST API, then the protocol protects application from replay attacks at the network level. But it will not prevent legitimate clients from issuing the same request multiple times.

### Business risk:

A legitimate but malicious user can perform a successful attack against the system.

### Technical details:

By sending a great number of HTTP requests to the web server it is possible in some cases to cause a Denial of Service condition to the application.

The following screenshot represent several identical requests sent by the same user in a short period of time:

## What problem does this feature solve?

Fixes security hole.

## How do you think this should be implemented?

It is recommended to implement an anti-automation mechanism such as CAPTCHA.

## Would you be willing to work on this?

Maybe, with help/guidance from Directus team.
