{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not implement any mechanism to prevent replay attacks, allowing an attacker to resend identical requests and have them processed multiple times.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of anti-replay mechanism, leading to processing of identical requests multiple times.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS) by sending a large number of identical HTTP requests.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending identical HTTP requests to the web server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A user who can send HTTP requests to the server, potentially a legitimate but malicious user."
