Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a Blind SQL injection in the PHPSHE B2C mall system v1.7.
*   The `userlevel_id` parameter is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or filtering in the `pe_select` function, specifically within the `_dowhere` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query. The response may not directly reveal the result of the injected code, making it a "blind" injection.
*   **Unsafe Parameter Handling:** The `userlevel_id` parameter from the GET request is passed through multiple functions (`admin.php` -> `user.php` -> `user.hook.php` -> `pe_select`) and is ultimately used in the database query without being validated or sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, financial data, or other confidential data.
*   **Potential Data Modification/Deletion:** Depending on the database user privileges, the attacker might be able to modify or delete data, leading to a complete compromise of the application.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could potentially craft SQL queries that cause the database to become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a GET request to `admin.php` with the vulnerable parameter `userlevel_id` in the URL.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker manipulates the value of the `userlevel_id` parameter to include malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the application:** The attacker needs access to the application and the vulnerable URL.
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a manipulated `userlevel_id` parameter.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) includes a sample HTTP GET request and shows how to use SQLMap to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is located in the admin section of the application, suggesting that the attacker might need to have administrative privileges to exploit it. However, this is not stated explicitly, the exploit may be possible through other routes if the `userlevel_id` is used in other parts of the application accessible without login.

This vulnerability allows a malicious user to potentially gain access to the database through SQL injection, potentially leaking sensitive data or modifying data.
