The provided content includes details for multiple CVEs. Here's the breakdown for CVE-2020-19641:

**CVE-2020-19641**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insecure privilege management, allowing a user with "operator" privileges to overwrite the admin user details.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Privilege escalation due to unsafe actions and lack of proper access control. Specifically, an operator user can change the password and group of another user including the administrator.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with operator privileges can gain full administrative control over the device by overwriting the administrator account's credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/formUserMng` endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have operator-level credentials to exploit the vulnerability. They also need to be on the same network as the device to send the HTTP request.
