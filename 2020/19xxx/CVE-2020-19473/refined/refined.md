Based on the provided information, this issue relates to a floating-point exception (specifically an integer divide-by-zero) vulnerability in `pdf2json`.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is an integer divide-by-zero error within the `DCTStream::decodeImage` function. This is triggered during the processing of a specially crafted PDF document.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Integer divide-by-zero error in `DCTStream::decodeImage`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The program crashes due to the unhandled floating-point exception (SIGFPE). This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted PDF file to the `pdf2json` utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted PDF file to the `pdf2json` program. This typically would require the user to attempt to process the malicious PDF document.
