The provided content relates to CVE-2020-19692.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a logic error in the `njs_module_read` function within the `njs_module.c` file.
- The code uses `fstat` to retrieve file statistics. It checks if the file is a regular file (`S_ISREG(sb.st_mode)`) and, if so, adds the file size to the allocated buffer size. However, if the file is not a regular file, the allocated buffer size does not account for the file size, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow during the subsequent read operation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability occurs due to an incorrect size calculation for the buffer used to read file content. Specifically, the buffer size is not increased when the opened file is not a regular file, although the code later attempts to read file content based on the file size retrieved by `fstat`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow can lead to various security issues, including:
    - Program crashes due to memory corruption.
    - Potential arbitrary code execution if the overflow can overwrite critical data on the heap.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted file that is not a regular file, when loading a module in njs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to cause the njs module loader to load a non-regular file like a device file or a directory.
- The attacker would need access to the system running njs in order to provide a non-regular file.
