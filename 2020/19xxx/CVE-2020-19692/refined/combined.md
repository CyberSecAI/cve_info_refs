# env

ubuntu 18.04

njs [0feca92](https://github.com/nginx/njs/commit/0feca922f9508f0b21d777387424edf188d4ce65)

gcc version 7.4.0 (Ubuntu 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04.1)

# bug

So, actually this is a logic bug, happened under an really interesting circumstance.

the buggy function is the njs\_module\_read in the file njs\_module.c

```
if (fstat(fd, &sb) == -1) {
        goto fail;
    }

    text->length = nxt_length(NJS_MODULE_START);

    if (S_ISREG(sb.st_mode) && sb.st_size) {
        text->length += sb.st_size;
    }

    text->length += nxt_length(NJS_MODULE_END);

    text->start = nxt_mp_alloc(vm->mem_pool, text->length);
    if (text->start == NULL) {
        goto fail;
    }

    p = nxt_cpymem(text->start, NJS_MODULE_START, nxt_length(NJS_MODULE_START));

    n = read(fd, p, sb.st_size);
```

as you can see, it read the sb.st\_size and sb.st\_mode with function fstat. However if we dont provide a common .js file. the S\_ISREG(sb.st\_mode) will be 0. text->length wont be updated.

and read(fd, p, sb.st\_size); still read sb.st\_size bytes into the p. p is on the heap. So we can overflow to the next chunk on the heap....

# poc

```
import crypto from '/'

```
