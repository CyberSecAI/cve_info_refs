Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `invertImage()` function within the `tiffcrop.c` file of the libtiff library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `invertImage()` function incorrectly calculates the number of pixels to be processed. It iterates over `width` when it should be `width/(8/bps)`. When processing some image types with the `invert` option, it attempts to write beyond the allocated memory buffer for the image data.
- Specifically, the code iterates based on width, but processes 4 pixels per iteration for certain image formats, leading to writing 4*width pixels when the buffer is smaller.
- The code also uses an incorrect formula `(4 - x)` when it should be `(3 - x)` to invert color values.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap buffer overflow leads to a crash of the application due to memory corruption, causing a denial of service. This is confirmed by the AddressSanitizer output in the bug report, which shows a heap-buffer-overflow error and the program aborting.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted TIFF image using `tiffcrop` with the `-I` option to invert the colors.
- The attacker needs to supply a malicious TIFF image file to trigger the vulnerability in `tiffcrop`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `tiffcrop` utility with a crafted TIFF image file. No special privileges are required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in libtiff version 4.0.10, as well as the version used in Debian 9 (4.0.8-2+deb9u7) before the patch.
- The bug report notes the issue is critical (P1).
- The vulnerability is located in `tiffcrop.c` at line 9206.
- The issue is related to how the `invertImage()` function handles different bits per sample (bps).
- The issue is fixed in a merge request: <https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/merge_requests/61>
- Debian LTS issued a security advisory DLA-2777-1 to fix this issue along with CVE-2020-19144
