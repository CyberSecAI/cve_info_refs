Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Relates to CVE:** NOINFO (The provided content is about a bug report related to Array.prototype.slice in njs, but it's not a CVE description, but rather a bug report that could potentially lead to a CVE. There is no mention of CVE-2020-19695)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The issue arises when `Array.prototype.slice.call()` is used with a primitive value (like a number) as its `this` context.
- Specifically, when the `length` property is manipulated on the prototype of the primitive object to a string value, then `slice` is called with that object, this leads to an attempt to access uninitialized memory, resulting in a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of primitive values when used as the `this` context in `Array.prototype.slice`.
- Failure to properly validate the type of `this` object within the `slice` function, and its length property
- The code relies on the existence of numerical properties which is not present on primitive objects.
- The access to the length property using `__proto__` allows modifying the prototype, which is unsafe
- Potential for memory corruption or other undefined behavior due to accessing uninitialized memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault, leading to a crash of the njs runtime.
- Potential denial of service due to the application crashing.
- Possible exploitation if the attacker can manipulate the prototype chain and then trigger a `slice` operation, potentially leading to further memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- JavaScript code that manipulates the prototype of a primitive number object and then calls `Array.prototype.slice.call()` on a primitive object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the njs environment, and specifically has to set the property `length` of primitive type's prototype to a string, then call slice on the primitive.
- The attacker needs to be able to use the javascript `__proto__` property to manipulate the prototype of primitive types.
