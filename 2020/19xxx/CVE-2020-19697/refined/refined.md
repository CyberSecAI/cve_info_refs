The provided content details a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in the editor.md application.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `src` attribute of `<iframe>` tags, allowing users to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within an `<iframe>` tag's `src` attribute. The specific payload used is `<iframe src=javascript://%0aalert(document.cookie)>`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to input content into the editor.md application, such as through a text input or by modifying content directly in the editor.
