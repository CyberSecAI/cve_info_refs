**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the `DCTStream::getChar` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which leads to a segmentation fault.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact is a crash of the `pdf2json` application. A malformed PDF file can trigger this crash, potentially leading to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted PDF file that triggers the NULL pointer dereference in the `DCTStream::getChar` function when processed by `pdf2json`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to the `pdf2json` application. This can be achieved by having the user open a malicious file or, if possible, injecting the PDF file into a vulnerable workflow that uses `pdf2json`.
