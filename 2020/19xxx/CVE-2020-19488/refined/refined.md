Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2020-19488.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in the `ilst_item_Read` function within the `box_code_apple.c` file of the GPAC library. This occurs when the code attempts to access a member of a `GF_Box` structure through a null pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The `ilst_item_Read` function attempts to access a member of a `GF_Box` structure (`a->size`) without properly validating that `a` is not a null pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a crash of the MP4Box application due to a segmentation fault. This results in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing a maliciously crafted MP4 file to the MP4Box tool. The specific structure of the MP4 file triggers the vulnerable code path in `ilst_item_Read`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide an input file to the MP4Box application. This could involve either direct access to the system running MP4Box or delivering the crafted file via other methods such as through a website or email.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was reported by a fuzzer finding the crash in MP4Box.
- The provided PoC allows the issue to be reproduced.
- The commit `6170024568f4dda310e98ef7508477b425c58d09` addresses this issue by adding a check for a null pointer of a before accessing the structure member.
