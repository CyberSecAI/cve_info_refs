- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper file type validation when handling uploaded files. Specifically, the camera software does not verify the file extension of the uploaded file, allowing an attacker to bypass the intended file type restrictions by modifying the bytes of the "recdata.db" file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload with dangerous type. The system does not prevent a user from uploading an ASP file by disguising it as a media file by changing the file extension in the database.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code (in this case, an ASP shell) on the SD card, potentially gaining control over the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker modifies the recdata.db file to change file extensions from .avi to .asp and uploads it to the device. The attacker then uses a web browser to access the ASP file, located in the SD card directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the device to modify "recdata.db" and also requires knowledge of the location of the ASP files on the SD card after the upload.
