{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not filter the path passed by the user in the background template management office, leading to arbitrary file read vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file read vulnerability due to lack of path sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/admin/filemanager` endpoint with the `mode` parameter set to `editfile` and the `path` parameter pointing to a file on the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have access to the admin panel and be able to send HTTP requests."
