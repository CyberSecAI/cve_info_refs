{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ari-adminer WordPress plugin does not sanitize the 'Connection' parameter when saving connection settings. Specifically, the 'title' field is not filtered for XSS when saving the connection settings which are then stored in the database and displayed to users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'title' field of a database connection, leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of a user viewing the connection settings.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the 'title' parameter of a connection setting through the plugin's interface. This injected script is stored in the database and executed when the connection details are viewed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have the ability to create or edit database connections within the ari-adminer plugin. This likely requires a valid WordPress user account with sufficient permissions."
