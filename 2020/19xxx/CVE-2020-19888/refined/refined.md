{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control on the cache clearing operation within the `dbhcms\\page.php` file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted access to the cache clearing function",
      "Lack of authorization checks"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to empty the database cache table (e.g., xxx_cms_cache), which can lead to denial of service or data loss.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a POST request to `/index.php?dbhcms_pid=9999999999&dbhcms_params=32333` with the `dbhcmsCache=CT_EMPTYALL` parameter to trigger the cache clear function.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to send a specially crafted POST request to the server."
