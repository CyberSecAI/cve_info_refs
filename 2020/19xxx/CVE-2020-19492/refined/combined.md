## Description

![@strongcourage](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9584484?u=70bfd027902a383d8501418ce32b61e460ea67bd&v=4&size=48)[strongcourage](https://github.com/strongcourage)opened [on Jul 18, 2019](https://github.com/pts/sam2p/issues/66#issue-469711089)

Hi,

I found a FPE bug on the latest commit `cafd4b8` of master.

PoC: <https://github.com/strongcourage/PoCs/blob/master/sam2p_cafd4b8/PoC_fpe>

Command: sam2p $PoC /tmp/out.bmp

ASAN says:

```
This is sam2p 0.49.4.
Available Loaders: PS PDF JAI PNG JPEG TIFF PNM BMP GIF LBM XPM PCX TGA.
Available Appliers: XWD Meta Empty BMP PNG TIFF6 TIFF6-JAI JPEG-JAI JPEG PNM GIF89a+LZW XPM PSL1C PSL23+PDF PSL2+PDF-JAI P-TrOpBb.
sam2p-asan: Warning: TGA: 24 bit image, 9 bit alpha is greater than 24 total bits per pixel
sam2p-asan: Warning: TGA: reducing to * bit alpha: 0
Floating point exception

```

Thanks,

Manh Dung
