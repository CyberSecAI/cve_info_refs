The provided content describes two stored XSS vulnerabilities in the mblog application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities stem from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in two distinct areas:

1.  `/post/editing` value parameter: The application does not properly sanitize the input received through the `/post/editing` parameter.
2.  `/settings/profile` value parameter: Similarly, the input provided via the `/settings/profile` parameter is not correctly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. User-controlled data is not sanitized, allowing injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML. When other users access the affected content, the attacker's script will be executed in their browsers, potentially leading to:

*   Stealing cookies or session tokens.
*   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
*   Defacing the website.
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through user-supplied input via HTTP parameters:

1.  `/post/editing` parameter in the blog posting functionality.
2.  `/settings/profile` parameter in the user profile settings.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to submit content through the vulnerable parameters. Specifically, they need to be able to post new content (or edit existing content) and be able to modify user profile settings.
