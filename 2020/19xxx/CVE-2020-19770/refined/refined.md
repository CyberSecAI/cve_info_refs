Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of blacklists to filter JavaScript code within the system bulletin functionality of WUZHI CMS v4.1.0. This approach is ineffective as it's difficult to anticipate all possible malicious payloads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The system fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating or editing system bulletins. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected and stored in the database. This stored XSS vulnerability is triggered when a user views the bulletin.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Theft:** An attacker can inject JavaScript code that steals the session cookies of users who view the malicious bulletin. This allows the attacker to impersonate the victim user and gain access to their account. In the provided example, an attacker steals the admin's cookies.
*   **Account Compromise:** By stealing administrator cookies, an attacker can potentially take complete control of the affected WUZHI CMS instance.
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** The injected JavaScript can perform a variety of malicious actions within the context of the user's browser session, including redirecting users to malicious sites, modifying page content, and other attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **System Bulletin:** The primary attack vector is the system bulletin feature within the WUZHI CMS administration panel. An attacker with low privileges can create a malicious system bulletin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Low-Privilege Access:** An attacker needs to have low-privilege access to WUZHI CMS to create or edit system bulletins.
*   **Social Engineering (Optional):** An attacker might use social engineering to entice an administrator to view the malicious bulletin, thus triggering the XSS attack and allowing them to steal administrator cookies.

**Additional Details**
*   The provided example payload demonstrates a working exploit: `</textarea><details open="" ontoggle=alert(document.cookie)><textarea>`. This payload exploits the improper filtering of the input and uses an `ontoggle` event handler to execute the javascript when the details element is toggled.
*  The attacker changes a title to prompt an administrator to click on this page.
* The attacker needs to change a title of the malicious bulletin to prompt the administrator to click the change button to trigger the XSS attack.
