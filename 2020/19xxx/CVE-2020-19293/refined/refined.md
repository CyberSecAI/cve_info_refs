Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is insufficient input sanitization in the Jeesns article submission process. Specifically, the application does not properly handle or filter user-provided HTML content, allowing malicious script to be injected and stored in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application attempts to filter `<script>` and `<style>` tags and some HTML events, but it fails to handle case variations in tag names (e.g., `<Script>` instead of `<script>`).
- **Lack of Output Encoding:** The application directly renders the stored content without proper encoding, allowing the injected script to execute in the user's browser.
- **Incomplete Filtering:** Although some HTML events are filtered, other potential XSS vectors are not addressed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which can then be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the compromised article.
- **Session Hijacking:**  The attacker could potentially steal session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker might be able to steal user data or perform actions on behalf of the user.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker could modify the appearance of the website for malicious purposes.
- **Phishing:**  The attacker can create fake login forms or other elements to trick users into revealing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Article Submission:**  The attacker would need to register a user account. Then, they would submit an article containing a malicious XSS payload in the article content.
- **Admin Interaction:** The XSS is triggered when the background administrator views the article which is being reviewed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Registered User:** The attacker must have a registered user account.
- **Basic Knowledge of HTML/JavaScript:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft a functional XSS payload.
- **Access to Article Submission Feature:** The attacker must have access to the functionality which allows them to submit or modify article content.
