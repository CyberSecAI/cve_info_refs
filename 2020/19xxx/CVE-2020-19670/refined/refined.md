The provided content describes a vulnerability in Niushop B2B2C Multi-business basic version V1.11, specifically related to administrator password reset.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the password reset functionality within `application\shop\controller\Login.php`, specifically lines 757-769.
- The application uses the loose comparison operator `==` in PHP to verify the verification code. This allows bypassing the verification check using PHP's type juggling behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Weak comparison:** Using `==` instead of `===` in PHP for verification allows for type juggling and bypasses the intended logic.
- **Lack of strict verification:** The code does not perform a strict check on the verification code, enabling an attacker to manipulate the input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass the verification code check during the password reset process.
- By exploiting this, they can reset the password of any administrator account by submitting a null mobile number after bypassing the verification.
- Successful exploitation allows unauthorized access to the administrative panel of the e-commerce system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to intercept the password reset request using a tool like Burp Suite.
- By modifying the request parameters, specifically adding an array after the `send_parem` parameter, the attacker can bypass the weak type check in PHP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the password reset functionality of the application.
- The attacker requires a tool like Burp Suite to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
- No authentication is needed to initiate the password reset.
