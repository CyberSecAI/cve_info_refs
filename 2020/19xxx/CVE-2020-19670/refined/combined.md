# Administrator password reset in Niushop B2B2C Multi-business basic version V1.11

Here the verification code is verified with php "==", which can be bypassed by weak php type

## 2.poc

Normal submission will show inconsistent verification code

Use the burstsuit to capture the package, add an array after the send\_parem, you can bypass the weak type of php and not empty.

Because the verification code is already recognized, you can reset the password by submitting the administrator’s mobile number to null.
