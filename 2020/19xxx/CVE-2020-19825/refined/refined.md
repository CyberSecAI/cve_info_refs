The provided content is related to CVE-2020-19825.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient output sanitization in the `timesheet description` field within the Kimai application. Specifically, user-provided text was not properly escaped before being rendered in HTML, leading to a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application was vulnerable to XSS attacks because user-provided descriptions were rendered without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within the timesheet description. When a user views the timesheet, this injected script would execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Defacement
  - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious input in the timesheet description field:** An attacker would craft a malicious script within the timesheet description field.
- **Viewing affected pages:** The malicious script will be executed when the page where the description is displayed is viewed by another user, such as in timesheet export views, invoice pages or timesheet indexes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker would need an authenticated account within the Kimai application, with access to create/modify timesheet entries.
- **Ability to input text in timesheet description field.**

**Mitigation:**
The fix implements escaping of the `entry.description` with the `escape` Twig filter before passing it to the `desc2html` filter, which uses the `MarkdownExtension::markdownToHtml()` to convert the description to HTML. In addition, the `markdownToHtml()` function is modified to use `$this->markdown->toHtml($content, false)` which disables `HTML` tag processing from markdown input.
