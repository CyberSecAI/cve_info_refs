The provided content relates to CVE-2020-19490.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the `DecodeChunk` function within the `tinyexr.h` header file. Specifically, an extremely large `line_no` value can lead to an integer overflow when calculating offsets within the image data, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow: The code does not properly validate the `line_no` value, allowing a large value to cause an integer overflow. This leads to an invalid memory access.
- Out-of-bounds write: The overflow leads to `DecodePixelData` writing to an out-of-bounds memory address, causing a segmentation fault.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash: The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to a segmentation fault, causing a denial-of-service.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution:  While not explicitly stated, out-of-bounds writes can potentially be leveraged for more severe consequences like arbitrary code execution in some scenarios.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted EXR file: An attacker could create a specially crafted EXR image file with a large `line_no` value designed to trigger the integer overflow and subsequent crash when processed by `tinyexr`.
- File parsing: The vulnerability occurs during the parsing of an EXR file, when the `DecodeChunk` function processes the image data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted EXR file to a user or process that utilizes the vulnerable `tinyexr` library.

**Additional details:**
- The fix introduces a check to invalidate data if the `line_no` is too large (either greater than 2^20 or less than -2^20), preventing the integer overflow.
- The provided GitHub issue contains the valgrind and ASAN output showing the crash, pinpointing the location of the vulnerability.
- The fix is implemented in commit `a685e33`, which added a check for the `line_no` value.
