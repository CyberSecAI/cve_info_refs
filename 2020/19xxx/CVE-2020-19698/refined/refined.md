Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-provided input within the editor.md application. Specifically, the application allows users to embed `<script>` tags with a `src` attribute pointing to external resources (in this case, a publicly hosted AngularJS library).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page.
- **Unrestricted `<script>` tag:**  The application allows the inclusion of `<script>` tags with the `src` attribute without proper validation or sanitization of the source URL.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Input entered into the editor is directly rendered, permitting execution of injected script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Page Redirection:** The attacker can redirect the user to a malicious website, as demonstrated in the provided example using `window.location.replace()`.
- **Data Theft:** The injected script could be used to steal sensitive user data, including cookies, session tokens, or form data.
- **Malware Installation:** The injected script could trigger the download and installation of malware.
- **Defacement:**  The injected script could alter the appearance of the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Input:**  An attacker directly enters the malicious `<script>` code into the editor.md input field.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker could trick a victim into visiting a page containing the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Input Data:** The attacker needs the ability to input data into the editor.md application (or have the user input data for them).
- **Knowledge of XSS Vulnerability:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the XSS vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of JavaScript and DOM manipulation:** The attacker needs to understand how to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code.
