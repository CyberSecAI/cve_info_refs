Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the inadequate input sanitization of user-provided content when answering questions. Specifically, the application fails to properly filter or escape HTML tags and JavaScript events, which allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. User-supplied data is not adequately sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious script tags (`<script>`) and HTML event handlers that are then stored in the database.
- **Incomplete Filtering:** The application attempts to filter `<script>` and `<style>` tags and some HTML event attributes, but the filtering mechanism can be bypassed through capitalization (e.g. using `<Script>` instead of `<script>`).
- **Lack of Output Encoding:** When the stored content is retrieved and displayed on the page, it is rendered without proper encoding, allowing the injected scripts to execute within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially steal user cookies and session tokens, leading to account hijacking.
- **Phishing/Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites or inject phishing forms into the application's pages.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker may also modify data within the application's context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input:** The attacker injects the malicious payload through the "answer" input field in the question/answer feature.
- **Editor Source Input:** The specific attack vector involves using the editor's source input to inject the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the application to answer a question.
- **Basic Understanding of HTML/JavaScript:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript to craft the malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**
The provided Java code snippet shows the `XssWrapper` class, which attempts to filter XSS by:
- Using regex to filter out `<script>` and `<style>` tags
- Escaping HTML characters using `HtmlUtils.htmlEscape`
- Replacing some HTML event keywords (e.g. "onmouseover", "onclick") with a modified version prefixed with underscore.

However, the bypass is achieved through capitalization in the injected payload, e.g. `<Script>prompt(/xss/)</Script>`, which renders the regex-based filtering ineffective due to lack of case-insensitive matching. The data is then saved in the database and displayed to other users without any further sanitization.
