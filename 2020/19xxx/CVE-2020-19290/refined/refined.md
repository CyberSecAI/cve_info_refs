Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-19290:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user input in the Weibo comment section of the Jeesns application. Specifically, the application attempts to filter `<script>` and `<style>` tags and some HTML event attributes, but it does so in a case-sensitive manner.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. User-provided input in the Weibo comments is saved directly to the database without proper sanitization. When this unsanitized data is retrieved and displayed to other users, the embedded malicious script can be executed in their browsers.
*   **Case-Sensitive Filtering:** The filtering mechanism used to block scripts and styles is case-sensitive. Attackers can bypass this filter by using uppercase or mixed-case tags like `<ScRiPt>` or `<StYlE>`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can perform various actions, such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Account Hijacking:** If the attacker steals session cookies, they could potentially hijack user accounts.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers could modify the content of the website as viewed by other users, leading to defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the Weibo comment input field.
*   **User Interaction:** Users trigger the vulnerability when they view a Weibo post containing a malicious comment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Jeesns application to post a comment.
*   **Knowledge of Bypass:** The attacker needs to know how to bypass the case-sensitive filters (e.g., using mixed-case or uppercase tags) or other bypass techniques.
