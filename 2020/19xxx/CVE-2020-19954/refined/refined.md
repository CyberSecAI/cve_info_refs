Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `/api/notify.php` file of S-CMS v3.0.
*   The `simplexml_load_string` function is used to parse XML data received via a POST request.
*   The default behavior of older versions of `simplexml_load_string` is to parse entities, and this functionality is not disabled. This allows for XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **XXE Injection:** The application is vulnerable to XXE injection because it processes external entities in the XML data without proper sanitization or disabling entity loading.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Through the crafted XXE payloads, an attacker can read arbitrary files from the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to read sensitive files from the server's file system. This could include configuration files, database credentials, source code, or other sensitive data.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker gains access to potentially sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST request to `/api/notify.php`:** The attacker sends a malicious XML payload via a POST request to the specified endpoint. The payload will contain the crafted XXE injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access to the vulnerable application:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `/api/notify.php` endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker must know that the application is vulnerable to XXE injection via the specified endpoint and how to craft the malicious XML payload.
*   **Ability to host a malicious XML file:** For blind XXE attacks (as demonstrated), the attacker needs to host a malicious XML file on a server they control.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to older versions of PHP where `simplexml_load_string` defaults to parsing entities. Newer versions do not parse entities by default, and the `LIBXML_NOENT` option needs to be specified to enable parsing.
*   The provided content details both a simple XXE test using an internal entity and a blind XXE attack using a remote XML file and PHP file on a attacker server to extract file content via base64 encoding.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited to perform blind arbitrary file reads by using php's filter stream along with base64 encoding.
