- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read due to an unverified index into an array. Specifically, the `code` variable used to index the `g->codes` array can become larger than the defined size of the array.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read. The code in `gif_out_code` does not properly validate the `code` variable before using it as an index for the `g->codes` array.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The out-of-bounds read can lead to a segmentation fault, causing the program to crash. This could potentially be leveraged for other exploits.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing a specially crafted GIF file as input to the `img2sixel` tool, an attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds read. The `img2sixel -8 array_overflow` command demonstrates this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide an input file to the `img2sixel` program.
