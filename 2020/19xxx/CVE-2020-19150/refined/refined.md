```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not filter the path parameter passed by the user in the file management functionality, allowing for traversal outside the intended directories.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file deletion due to lack of path sanitization/validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can delete any file on the server that the web application has access to, leading to potential data loss and disruption of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request with the 'mode' parameter set to 'delete' and the 'path' parameter pointing to the file they want to delete, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have access to the web application's admin panel and knowledge of the file system structure on the server."
