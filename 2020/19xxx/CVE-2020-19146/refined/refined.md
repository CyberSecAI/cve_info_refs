```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not filter user-controlled input when modifying template paths in the background. This allows an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary file read due to lack of input validation on template paths.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server by manipulating the template path.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by modifying the template path through the application's administrative interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the administrative interface and the ability to modify template paths."
