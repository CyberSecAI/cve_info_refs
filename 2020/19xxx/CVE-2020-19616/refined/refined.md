- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `/post/editing` and `/settings/profile` parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML, potentially leading to malicious actions being performed in the context of other users' sessions (session hijacking, defacement, etc).
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted request to the `/post/editing` or `/settings/profile` endpoints with malicious payloads in the value parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with the application by sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
