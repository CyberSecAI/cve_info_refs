Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-19885:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `dbhcms\mod\mod.page.edit.php` file. Specifically, the `$_POST['pageparam_insert_name']` variable is directly used in the code without being processed through `htmlspecialchars()` or similar functions that prevent HTML injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. User-provided input, designed to be a parameter name for a page, is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code. This injected code is then stored in the database and executed when an administrator views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Hijacking:** A successful XSS attack can lead to the hijacking of other user accounts, especially administrator accounts. This can enable an attacker to gain full control over the system by redirecting the logged in user to a malicious site, or by performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious POST request to the `dbhcms\mod\mod.page.edit.php` script, specifically targeting the `$_POST['pageparam_insert_name']` parameter.
*   **Malicious Input:**  The attacker injects a malicious script within the `$_POST['pageparam_insert_name']` parameter.  For example: `33'<img/src/onerror=alert(13)>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:**  The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator user to access the vulnerable function of adding a new page parameter in `dbhcms\mod\mod.page.edit.php`.
*   **Web Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the web interface of the vulnerable system.
