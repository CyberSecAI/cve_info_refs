The provided content describes two stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the mblog application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization/validation of user-supplied data at two different endpoints: `/post/editing` and `/settings/profile`. The application fails to properly encode or sanitize user inputs before rendering them back to the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious scripts are stored in the application's database or file system, and then executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected pages.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not adequately sanitize user-provided input, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution: An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- Session hijacking: An attacker can potentially steal cookies or other session information to impersonate a user.
- Defacement: The attacker could modify the content of the web pages to display malicious or misleading content.
- Phishing: The attacker could create fake login forms to steal user credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker submits malicious scripts as part of the `/post/editing` and `/settings/profile` parameters.
- The malicious scripts are stored by the application.
- When other users visit the affected pages, the malicious scripts are executed in their browsers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to submit data to the vulnerable endpoints. This might require an account with appropriate privileges.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable endpoints are `/post/editing` and `/settings/profile`.
- The provided proof-of-concept (POC) uses `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` as the XSS payload.
