The provided content describes a file upload vulnerability in Niushop B2B2C Multi-business basic version V1.11.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application uses the `getimagesize` function to verify if an uploaded file is an image. This check can be bypassed, allowing the upload of arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient file type validation. The application relies on `getimagesize`, which can be bypassed.
- Lack of authentication for the upload interface which is publicly accessible.
- Unrestricted file upload leading to arbitrary file upload.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can gain a shell on the server, leading to full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the `upload.php` file located at `\application\admin\controller\`.
- By sending a POST request with the `parameter_uopload` and `file_path` parameters containing a malicious PHP file, the attacker bypasses file validation and uploads the file to a location accessible via a returned path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be logged in or authenticated to access the vulnerable upload endpoint.
- The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests.
