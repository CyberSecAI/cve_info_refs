The provided content is related to CVE-2020-19751.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in `odf_code.c` at line 3295 due to an insufficient size check.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** A buffer on the heap is overwritten due to a missing or incorrect size check when processing an MPEG-4 descriptor.
*   **Invalid free:** The heap-buffer-overflow may result in `gf_odf_del_ipmp_tool` attempting to free an invalid memory address

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Crash:** The AddressSanitizer (ASan) output indicates a crash due to the heap-buffer-overflow and related memory corruption.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, heap-buffer-overflows can be exploited for arbitrary code execution, if the attacker can control the data written to the overflowed buffer.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious MP4 File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted MP4 file that has a malformed MPEG-4 descriptor. The parsing of this descriptor triggers the overflow in `odf_code.c`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application, GPAC, with a specially crafted MP4 file. This implies the attacker can get the user to open or process this crafted file.
