The provided content describes a vulnerability in the `admin_add.php` file of an online book store project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper file type validation in the `admin_add.php` file. The script directly copies an uploaded file to the `/bootstrap/img/` directory without checking the file extension or content, enabling arbitrary file uploads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary file upload:** The application allows an attacker to upload any file type, including executable files such as PHP scripts.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The application doesn't sanitize or validate the uploaded file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution:** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP script and execute it on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Webshell:** An attacker can upload a webshell allowing arbitrary code execution and unauthorized access.
- **Data exfiltration:** With access to the server, an attacker could steal sensitive data such as user credentials, application configurations, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request containing the malicious file using a multipart/form-data format to `admin_add.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No login required, meaning the vulnerability can be exploited by anyone.
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `admin_add.php` endpoint.
