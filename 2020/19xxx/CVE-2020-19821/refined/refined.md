Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `doyocms` application, specifically in the `admin.php` page related to class types editing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`orders[]` parameter) before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The provided example payload utilizes `updatexml` to extract the database version information. An attacker could use this vulnerability to extract other sensitive information from the database.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** Depending on the database privileges of the application user, the attacker might be able to modify or delete data. In more severe cases, they may be able to gain control over the system by executing operating system commands through the database.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/admin.php` page, specifically targeting the `a_classtypes` module and `alledit` action.
*   **Malicious Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `orders[]` in the URL. This parameter is manipulated with malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to access the vulnerable page `admin.php`.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web application.
