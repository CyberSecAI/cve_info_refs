Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided content when exporting notes to PDF format. Specifically, JavaScript code embedded within the note is not escaped or neutralized before being included in the PDF document generation process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows for stored XSS attacks. Malicious JavaScript code embedded in a note is executed when the note is exported to PDF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the generated PDF. This could lead to a range of malicious activities, such as:
    *   Data exfiltration
    *   Credential theft
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Supplied Input:** The attack vector is through user-created notes, where the user can insert malicious JavaScript code within the note content.
*   **Export to PDF Function:** The export to PDF function then renders the JavaScript code without sanitization, leading to execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Access:** An attacker needs to have user access to create/edit notes within BoostNote-Legacy.
*   **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs to be aware that the export to PDF function doesn't sanitize content and understand basic XSS payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided example payload is `%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS')%3C/script%3E`, which demonstrates a simple alert box, but more sophisticated malicious code could be injected.
*   The issue was identified in version 0.12.1
