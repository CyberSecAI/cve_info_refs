Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-19292 (based on the title of the github issue and the seebug page)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in the Jeesns question-answering feature. The application fails to properly filter user-supplied input when posting a question, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. User-supplied data, specifically within the question posting feature, is not properly sanitized.
- **Insufficient input validation:** The application attempts to filter `<script>` and `<style>` tags along with some HTML event attributes, but this filter can be bypassed using capitalization. The filtering logic is not robust enough to prevent malicious code injection.
- **Lack of Output Encoding:** The stored data is rendered without proper output encoding, allowing the injected scripts to execute within the browsers of other users who view the question.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the question content.
- **Session Hijacking:** By injecting JavaScript, an attacker could potentially steal cookies or session tokens of other users who view the affected content.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the appearance of the webpage.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website or download malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input:** The attack vector is the "question" field, which allows users to post content.
- **Payload:** The XSS payload is embedded within the question description and is triggered when a user views the question. An example payload is `<Script>prompt(/xss/)</Script>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Registered User:** The attacker needs to register an account to post a question.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTML/JavaScript and how to inject script tags.
- **No Privilege escalation:** This attack vector is achievable by any registered user.

**Additional Details (From Seebug Content):**

- The vulnerability exists in `Jeesns <= 1.4.2`
- The Seebug article includes a code snippet that shows the flawed XSS filtering. The filter attempts to remove `<script>` and `<style>` tags and replaces HTML event attributes, but it does not handle case sensitivity, allowing for bypass.
- The vulnerability is present within `jeesns-service\src\main\java\com\lxinet\jeesns\service\question\impl\QuestionServiceImpl.java` during the question saving process in the `save()` method.
- The vulnerability is reproducible by registering a user, posting a question with the payload, and viewing the question.

**Mitigation:**

The content suggests the following temporary and long-term solutions:
 - Apply proper input sanitization and output encoding for user-provided data to prevent XSS.
- Sanitize user input with robust regular expressions to filter out malicious script content.
