Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in insufficient input validation and sanitization of user-provided content in the Jeesns article comment functionality. The application attempts to filter XSS by removing `<script>` and `<style>` tags and escaping certain HTML events. However, it does not handle case-insensitive matching of these tags, allowing attackers to bypass these filters using variations in capitalization of the tags. Additionally, the application saves the user-provided data directly to the database without further filtering and renders it directly on the frontend, leading to stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient XSS filtering: The application's XSS filter can be bypassed due to case-sensitivity in the tag matching and insufficient handling of HTML events.
- Lack of input sanitization before database storage: User input, intended for article comments, is not properly sanitized before being stored in the database.
- Direct rendering of unfiltered data: The application directly renders the stored, unfiltered comment data on the frontend, leading to XSS execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application. When a user views an article containing a malicious comment, this JavaScript code will be executed in their browser. This can lead to various impacts:
- Session hijacking/cookie theft: An attacker can steal user session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
- Phishing attacks: An attacker can redirect users to phishing sites or present them with fake login forms to steal credentials.
- Defacement: An attacker can modify the content of the page being viewed.
- Malware distribution: An attacker can use XSS to distribute malware to vulnerable users
- Other malicious actions: Any other type of client-side script execution is possible within the context of the victim's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the comment functionality of the article feature, specifically the 'content' parameter submitted by the user.
-  A malicious user can create a comment on an article that includes XSS payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be a registered user with the ability to create and post comments on articles.
- The attacker needs to know of the vulnerability and the bypass to the filter, to successfully craft the XSS payload.
- No special privileges or permissions are needed.
