- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the FTP settings page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the application doesn't sanitize the fields sent to `goform/formSetFtpCfg` endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the FTP settings, which will be executed when a user views the FTP settings page. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions performed within the user's browser context.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, where an attacker injects a script via the vulnerable `goform/formSetFtpCfg` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have network access to the device and must be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker must also have a user to target.
