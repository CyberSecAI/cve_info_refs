Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `subzs.php` file of the zzcms application. Specifically, the `zzcmscpid` cookie value is directly concatenated into a SQL query within the `showcookiezs` function without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. The code directly uses the value from the `zzcmscpid` cookie in a SQL query, making it vulnerable to injection attacks. The vulnerable code is:
    ```php
    $sql="select id,proname,img from zzcms_main where id in (".$cpid.")";
    ```
    and
    ```php
    $sql="select id,proname,img from zzcms_main where id='$cpid' ";
    ```
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The application fails to sanitize or properly escape the user-controlled cookie data before using it in the SQL query. This lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, a successful SQL injection could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker could potentially bypass authentication mechanisms through the SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attack vector is through manipulating the `zzcmscpid` cookie in an HTTP request.
*   **Targeted File:** The vulnerability is located in `/zs/subzs.php`, specifically the `showcookiezs` function which is called by other functions. The injection can be triggered through the page `/zs/zs_list.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a manipulated `zzcmscpid` cookie.
*   **Knowledge of target application:** The attacker needs to understand the structure of the zzcms application and how the vulnerable function is called.
*   **Ability to craft SQL Injection payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL payloads that exploit the vulnerability to achieve the desired impact.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit can be performed through a boolean blind SQL injection.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by modifying the `zzcmscpid` cookie value to include SQL injection payloads.
*   The exploit provided uses `ascii(substr())` to perform the blind injection.
*   Spaces in the payload must be replaced with `/**/` to bypass the filter.
*   The application template must include `{#showcookiezs` for the vulnerable code to be executed.
