Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-19189:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `postprocess_terminfo` function of the ncurses library. Specifically, it occurs while processing the `box_chars_1` array which is used to synthesize the `acsc` string.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The code attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer of the `box_chars_1` array in `postprocess_terminfo` function within `tinfo/parse_entry.c`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** As stated in the NetApp advisory, successful exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service.
*   **Exposure of sensitive information:** As mentioned in the Debian LTS advisory, the out-of-bounds read could potentially lead to the exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Application termination:** The provided github content shows a crash of `infotocap` due to heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Arbitrary code execution**: While not explicitly stated, the possibility exists given that multiple sources mention arbitrary code execution for other ncurses CVEs and the root cause is memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted terminfo file that causes the `box_chars_1` array to be read out of bounds.
*   The NetApp advisory states the attack vector as "Network", implying a remote attack is feasible. The CVSS vector also indicates a network attack vector with low complexity and user interaction required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to supply a maliciously crafted terminfo entry to a vulnerable application.
*   The attack requires user interaction because the CVSS vector states "UI:R".
*   The attack can be done remotely because the CVSS vector states "AV:N"

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided github content contains a proof-of-concept demonstrating the vulnerability, confirming a heap-buffer-overflow in ncurses 6.1 using `infotocap` tool. The code snippet from `tinfo/parse_entry.c` shows the location of the vulnerable code.
*   The Apple security advisories for macOS mention that the ncurses vulnerability has been addressed with improved checks, this likely refers to bounds checking.
*   NetApp's advisory lists the affected products including Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere and products under investigation, along with products that are not affected. It also provides fixes and workarounds.
*   Debian LTS advisory confirms that the vulnerability has been fixed in the ncurses package version `6.1+20181013-2+deb10u4` for Debian 10 Buster.
*   The vulnerability affects ncurses versions prior to 6.1.
