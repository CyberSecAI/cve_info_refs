The content provided describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Piwigo application, specifically within the `admin/user_perm.php` and `admin/group_perm.php` files.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `user_id` parameter when handling user and group permissions. This allows an attacker to inject SQL queries into the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL injection in the `user_id` parameter within `admin/user_perm.php` and `admin/group_perm.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- The provided examples demonstrate the ability to extract the database name using `database()`.
- It can potentially lead to data extraction, modification, or complete database compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via HTTP requests to `admin.php` with the `page=user_perm` and a manipulated `user_id` parameter.
- Specifically, the manipulation happens when moving album permissions from the right to the left.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated and have access to the admin panel.
- The attacker needs to be able to create a private album.
- The attacker must have the ability to manipulate the album permissions.
