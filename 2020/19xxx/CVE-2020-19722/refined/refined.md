The content is related to CVE-2020-19722.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `AP4_NullTerminatedStringAtom` constructor within the Bento4 library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `AP4_NullTerminatedStringAtom` constructor when handling null terminated strings. The code allocates a buffer based on the size of the input string, but fails to account for the null terminator, potentially writing past the end of the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to a crash (denial of service) and potentially arbitrary code execution depending on the system and environment.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered when parsing a specially crafted MP4 file containing a malicious atom. The `mp42aac` tool is used to parse the input file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted MP4 file to be processed by the vulnerable software. The attacker needs to be able to get the `mp42aac` tool to process this crafted file.
