## Description

![@strongcourage](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9584484?u=70bfd027902a383d8501418ce32b61e460ea67bd&v=4&size=48)[strongcourage](https://github.com/strongcourage)opened [on Jul 18, 2019](https://github.com/pts/sam2p/issues/67#issue-469711369)

Hi,

I found a crash in the function CGIF::AddExtensionBlock on the latest commit `cafd4b8` of master. It seems that it is due to an incomplete patch of [#36](https://github.com/pts/sam2p/issues/36).

PoC: <https://github.com/strongcourage/PoCs/blob/master/sam2p_cafd4b8/PoC_segv>

Command: sam2p $PoC /tmp/out.bmp

ASAN says:

```
