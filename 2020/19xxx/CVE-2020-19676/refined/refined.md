Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an "Incorrect Access Control" issue in Nacos 1.1.4. This means that the system is not properly restricting access to sensitive data based on user authentication status.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users (visitors) to access sensitive service details via specific endpoints.
- **Missing Authentication/Authorization:** The application fails to enforce proper authentication or authorization checks before providing access to service information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated users can retrieve sensitive service details, potentially including:
    - Service names
    - Service metadata
    - Internal network information related to service instances.
- This information could be used by attackers to:
    - Understand the application's architecture
    - Identify potential attack vectors
    - Launch further attacks by leveraging the exposed data
    - Potentially lead to a larger compromise if the attacker can discover other exposed internal systems and gain further access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need only network access to the Nacos service to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Direct API Requests:**  The attacker makes requests to specific API endpoints that should be protected. The vulnerability is exposed in the `/nacos/v1/ns/service` and `/nacos/v1/ns/instance/list` API endpoints, which should require authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Nacos instance. No prior authentication or specific privileges are needed; the attacker could be an anonymous user on the network.

**Additional Details:**
The vulnerability is demonstrated by the issue reporter by showing that unauthenticated users can:
1. Access the service list interface (`/nacos/v1/ns/service`) to obtain the names of existing services.
2. Then, with a specific service name obtained in the first step, access the service details (`/nacos/v1/ns/instance/list`) interface to get details of instances of that service.
