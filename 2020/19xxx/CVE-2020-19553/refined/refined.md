Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of uploaded files, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code within a file that is then stored on the server.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means that the injected malicious code is permanently stored on the server.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: When a user visits or interacts with the uploaded malicious file, the injected JavaScript code will execute in their browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, stealing cookies, redirecting the user to a malicious site, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker uploads a file containing malicious JavaScript code to the server. The vulnerability exists within the file upload functionality of the WUZHI CMS.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files to the WUZHI CMS server. This would likely require some level of access to the system's backend or a feature that allows file uploads. The specific privileges needed are not detailed in the provided information.
