The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `dl_sendsms.php` file of the zzcms2019 software.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of the `dlid` cookie value into a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping. This occurs specifically when the `dlid` cookie value does not contain a comma.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization on the `dlid` cookie.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Data Exposure/Manipulation:** Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to the extraction of sensitive information from the database, modification or deletion of data, and potentially compromising the underlying system.
-   **Boolean Blind Injection:** The provided exploit uses a boolean blind injection technique to extract data.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `dlid` cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
-   **Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to set or modify the `dlid` cookie.

**Technical Details**

The vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
if (strpos(@$_COOKIE['dlid'],",")>0){
    $sql="select tel from zzcms_dl where passed=1 and id in (".@$_COOKIE['dlid'].") order by id asc limit $n,$size";
}else{
    $sql="select tel from zzcms_dl where passed=1  and id='".@$_COOKIE['dlid']."'";
}
```
The vulnerability occurs in the else block when the cookie does not contain a comma. The cookie value is directly inserted into the SQL query without sanitization using single quotes.

The attacker uses the following payload to perform the Boolean blind injection:

```
ascii(substr((select group_concat(user(),version(),@@version_compile_os)),{},1)))={}
```

and this payload is inserted into the dlid cookie. The script uses the response to determine whether the injected SQL query is true or false. This method allows for character by character extraction of the database information.
