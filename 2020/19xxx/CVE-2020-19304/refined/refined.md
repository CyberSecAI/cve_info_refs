The provided content describes a directory traversal vulnerability in MetInfo CMS version 7.0.0.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `doGetFileList` function within `/app/system/system/admin/filept.class.php`. The developer attempts to remove "../" sequences using `str_replace`, but this can be bypassed by using variations like "..././" or "....//".

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core vulnerability is a directory traversal vulnerability caused by inadequate input validation and sanitization. The use of `str_replace` to remove "../" sequences is insufficient to prevent directory traversal, because it only removes the exact string "../" and does not address alternative, equivalent path traversal sequences.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive data, system configuration files, or even the execution of arbitrary code, depending on server configurations.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves manipulating the path parameter passed to the `doGetFileList` function. By using sequences such as "..././" or "....//", an attacker can bypass the implemented `str_replace` filter and navigate to directories outside of the intended scope.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable version of MetInfo CMS. They need to be able to manipulate path parameters.
