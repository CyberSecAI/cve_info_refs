The provided content contains detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities in DBHcms v1.2.0, including the one specified in CVE-2020-19882.

**CVE-2020-19882**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `menu_description` variable in `dbhcms\mod\mod.menus.edit.php` at line 83 and in `dbhcms\mod\mod.menus.view.php` at line 111. Specifically, the `htmlspecialchars` function is not used to escape HTML characters.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before storing and displaying it, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*  **Attack vectors:** An attacker can inject the malicious javascript into the menu description field. When other users view the menu, the payload will execute.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative privileges to modify menu descriptions.
