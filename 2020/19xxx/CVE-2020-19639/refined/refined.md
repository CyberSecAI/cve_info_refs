- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web interface lacks CSRF protection, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of a user without their consent.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially modify any settings in the web interface by tricking a user into performing an unwanted action. This could include changing camera configurations or potentially performing other unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack can be launched remotely using a malicious website or email containing a crafted link or form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page or clicking a malicious link. No special privileges or user interaction on the camera are required other than a victim being logged in.
