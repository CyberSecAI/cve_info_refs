```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack overflow in the `XRef::fetch` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A stack overflow vulnerability exists due to uncontrolled recursion or a very large stack allocation within the `XRef::fetch` function, potentially when processing a crafted PDF file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact of exploitation is a crash of the application due to a stack overflow, leading to a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV). This can result in denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves providing a crafted PDF file that triggers the recursive behavior or excessive memory allocation in the `XRef::fetch` function. This can be done by loading the malicious PDF into `pdf2json`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to the `pdf2json` application. No special privileges are required beyond executing the program."
