Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is caused by a file extension blacklist bypass during file uploads. This allows attackers to upload files with extensions that are not blocked by the blacklist, which can then be executed by the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Insecure File Upload:** The primary vulnerability lies in the flawed implementation of file upload functionality. The application uses a blacklist approach for file extension filtering, which is inherently weak and susceptible to bypass techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The most severe impact is the ability for an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. By uploading malicious files with a bypassable extension, they can gain control over the server and potentially compromise the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **File Upload:** The attack vector is through the file upload functionality of the WUZHI CMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Access to File Upload Feature:** The attacker needs access to a file upload form within the WUZHI CMS. This could be a public facing form, or one accessible through user authentication.
* **Understanding of Blacklist Bypass:** The attacker requires knowledge on how to bypass the file extension blacklist used by the CMS.
