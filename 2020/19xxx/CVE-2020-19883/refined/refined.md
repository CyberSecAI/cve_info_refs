The provided content contains detailed information regarding multiple vulnerabilities in DBHcms v1.2.0, including CVE-2020-19883.

Here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-19883:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists because there is no security filter for the `user_login` variable in `dbhcms\mod\mod.users.view.php` on line 57. Specifically, the code doesn't sanitize or encode user-provided input before displaying it in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, which is then stored and executed in the context of other users who view the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **User Hijacking:** An attacker can potentially hijack the sessions of other users, including administrators, when they view the user management page (`mod.users.view.php`) after the malicious JavaScript has been stored. This can lead to a wide range of attacks, including unauthorized access to the system, data theft, and more.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated admin user and able to modify the user login value with malicious script on `http://localhost:8089/index.php?dbhcms_pid=-71`
*   When another user, including an admin, views the user information page (where the injected data is displayed), the XSS payload gets triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user with administrative privileges to access and modify user details through `http://localhost:8089/index.php?dbhcms_pid=-71`

In summary, CVE-2020-19883 is a stored XSS vulnerability resulting from a lack of input sanitization of the `user_login` field within the user management interface. An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious code that can lead to session hijacking for other users, including administrators.
