- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in two areas of the application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML, which could lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to phishing sites.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - `/post/editing` parameter.
  - `/settings/profile` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to submit crafted input to either the `/post/editing` or `/settings/profile` parameters. This could be achieved by having a user with appropriate access.
