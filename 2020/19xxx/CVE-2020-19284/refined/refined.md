Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in the Jeesns group comment feature. While the application attempts to filter out potentially malicious content, the filtering logic is flawed and can be bypassed. Specifically, the filtering mechanism does not account for case sensitivity when looking for `<script>` and `<style>` tags, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is saved in the database and executed when other users view the affected content (group post comments).
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application's XSS filter uses regular expressions and string replacement to sanitize input, but it fails to account for case sensitivity. This makes it vulnerable to simple bypass techniques.
*   **Direct Database Storage:** User-provided input is directly stored in the database without sufficient sanitization.
*   **Unsafe Rendering:** The application renders user-provided content directly from the database in a web page without proper encoding, leading to script execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of users who view the affected group post comments.
*   **Account Hijacking:** An attacker might use XSS to steal session cookies or other sensitive information and perform actions on behalf of a legitimate user.
*   **Malicious Redirects:** The injected script could redirect users to attacker-controlled websites.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could potentially alter the appearance or functionality of the webpage.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Comment Input Field:** The attacker injects the malicious XSS payload via the group comment input field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Jeesns platform.
*   **Access to Comment Feature:** The attacker must have the ability to post comments on group posts.
*   **Basic Understanding of HTML/JavaScript:** The attacker needs some basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript to craft a working XSS payload.
*   **No special privileges required:** The attacker does not need any elevated privileges or access to other users accounts.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability lies in the `XssWrapper` class used to filter user inputs:
```java
Private static String dealScript(String val) {
Pattern p = Pattern.compile("<script[\\s\\S]*?</script>");
Return htmlEscape(p, val);
}
Private static String dealStyle(String val) {
Pattern p = Pattern.compile("<style[^>]*?>[\\s\\S]*?</style>");
Return htmlEscape(p, val);
}
```
This code uses regular expressions to match and attempt to escape `<script>` and `<style>` tags. However, these patterns are case-sensitive, meaning `<Script>` or `<SCRIPT>` tags would not be matched.

The code also attempts to filter event handlers like `onmouseover` but doesn't do that correctly by using a case insensitive regex which would not prevent the execution of the script.

```java
String[] eventKeywords = new String[]{"onmouseover", "onmouseout", "onmousedown", "onmouseup", "onmousemove", "onclick", "ondblclick", "onkeypress", "onkeydown", "onkeyup", "ondragstart", "onerrorupdate", "onhelp", "onreadystatechange", "onrowenter", "onrowexit", "onselectstart", "onload", "onunload", "onbeforeunload", "onblur", "onerror", "onfocus ", "onresize", "onscroll", "oncontextmenu", "alert"};
For(int i = 0; i < eventKeywords.length; ++i) {
    Value = value.replaceAll("(?i)" + eventKeywords[i], "_" + eventKeywords[i]);
}
```

The `GroupTopicCommentServiceImpl.java` saves the user input directly to database with no further validation.
```java
groupTopicComment.setContent(content);
Int result = groupTopicCommentDao.saveObj(groupTopicComment);
```

**Example Payload:**
The provided example payload to trigger the XSS is `<Script>prompt(/xss/)</Script>`.
