{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect Access Control in Dswjcms 1.6.4 allows arbitrary file uploads.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Inadequate access controls lead to arbitrary file upload vulnerability. Specifically, the resources.html handler does not properly restrict file uploads, allowing malicious actors to upload PHP files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by uploading a malicious PHP file through the `index.php/Dswjcms/Basis/resources.html` handler.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected `index.php/Dswjcms/Basis/resources.html` endpoint, which is likely accessible to any user."
