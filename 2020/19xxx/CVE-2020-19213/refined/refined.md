- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `move_categories` method in `cat_move.php` does not properly validate or filter the `selection` and `parent` parameters before using them in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted POST request to `/admin.php?page=cat_move` with malicious SQL code in the `selection` or `parent` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker would likely need to be an authenticated user with the ability to move albums within the Piwigo application.
