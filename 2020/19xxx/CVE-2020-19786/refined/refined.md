- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows arbitrary file uploads without proper validation or restrictions on file types.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload. Specifically, the vulnerability allows uploading of PHP files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file, which, if executed, would allow them to gain a shell and take over the web server. This is particularly severe if administrator credentials are leaked.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g. PHP file) through the application's upload functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the file upload functionality, which may be publicly accessible or require some level of authorization depending on the application. In the specific scenario described, it is mentioned that if an administrator password is leaked, the uploaded file can be used for remote code execution.
