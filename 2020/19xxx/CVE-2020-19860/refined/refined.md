Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap out-of-bounds read in the `rr_frm_str_internal` function of the `ldns` library. This function is responsible for parsing resource records (RRs) from a string representation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The code incorrectly handles quoted strings within the resource record string, leading to a read beyond the allocated buffer.
*   The issue arises when parsing a string representation of a DNS resource record. Specifically, when handling a quoted string, the code increments the buffer pointer without checking its boundary, causing it to potentially read past the end of the buffer. The code attempts to skip spaces at the beginning of the string being parsed. If the code encounters a quote it will use that as a delimiter and increment the pointer, however the boundary check for the buffer was incorrect. The vulnerability is triggered specifically when parsing a quoted string.
    *   The original code used `ldns_buffer_remaining` to check if there was data left in the buffer. However, the correct check for the string buffer used during the parsing should have been `sldns_buffer_remaining`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data from the heap memory.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Depending on the specific memory layout and access patterns, the vulnerability could potentially cause a crash due to a segmentation fault or other memory-related errors. This can lead to DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed DNS Resource Records:** An attacker could craft a malicious DNS resource record with a specially crafted quoted string, triggering the out-of-bounds read when the `ldns` library attempts to parse it using `rr_frm_str_internal`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to send or provide a malformed DNS record to a system using the affected `ldns` library.
*   This can occur if the application takes in user-defined strings and attempts to parse them as DNS resource records.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content shows the commit that fixes the vulnerability. The fix involves changing the buffer boundary check used in the parsing. The commit message indicates the vulnerability was reported by "pokerfacett".
*   The issue was assigned the number #70 in the `ldns` project on github.
*   The commit message is "* bugfix [#70](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/ldns/pull/70): heap Out-of-bound Read vulnerability in `rr_frm_str_internal` reported by pokerfacett."

This analysis is more detailed than the official CVE description, as it provides context to the specific function and how the out-of-bounds read occurs.
