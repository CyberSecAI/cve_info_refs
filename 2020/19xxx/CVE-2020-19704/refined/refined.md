Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the `ResourseController.java` file within the `spring-boot-admin` project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. This means that malicious script can be injected into the system and stored, so that other users can trigger the payload when they access the compromised data.
- The controller "Resourse" does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code which can be executed within the browsers of other users who access the vulnerable page. This could lead to:
    - Stealing user session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate users.
    - Redirecting users to phishing sites to steal credentials.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via the ResourseController which processes user input and stores it without sufficient sanitization or encoding. When this data is later retrieved and rendered on a web page, the injected script executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to inject the malicious javascript code into the vulnerable component `ResourseController.java` (most likely a form or a REST endpoint).
