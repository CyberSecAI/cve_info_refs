Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2020-19596:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the CoreFTP Server when handling usernames during the SFTP (SSH) key-based authentication process.
*   Sending an overly long username string to the server's SSH service during the authentication process causes a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow. The server allocates a fixed-size buffer on the stack to hold the username, and an attacker can overwrite parts of the stack including the return address (EIP) by providing a username that exceeds the buffer's capacity.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The server fails to properly validate the length of the username received over the network. This allows an attacker to provide an arbitrarily long string, which results in a buffer overflow.
*   **Lack of Security Extensions:** The tested CoreFTP Server version lacks security extensions such as ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention), making exploitation easier, particularly on older operating systems like Windows XP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By overwriting the EIP (return address) on the stack with an address that points to attacker-controlled shellcode, the attacker can achieve arbitrary remote code execution on the server.
*   **Full System Control:** Because the CoreFTP server needs to run in Administrator mode, successful exploitation leads to at least local administrative privileges. This allows attackers to install malware, steal sensitive data, or further compromise the system.
*   **Potential for Credential Theft:** After gaining access, attackers can attempt to extract credentials stored within the application, potentially including encrypted passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by sending crafted username strings over the network to the vulnerable SFTP port.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attack does not require prior authentication to the service.
*   **SFTP (SSH) Key-Based Authentication:** The vulnerability is triggered during the SSH key-based authentication process. SSH key authentication needs to be enabled for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable server.
*   **Ability to Craft Network Packets:** The attacker needs to be able to create and send specially crafted SFTP packets containing an overly long username string.
*   **Knowledge of Buffer Overflow Exploitation:** The attacker needs to understand how to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities and have the capability to craft shellcode.
*   **Optionally, Knowledge of the target system:** As the exploit relies on a `JMP ESP` instruction in a DLL, the exploit is not 100% portable across OS versions, language and service packs.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post includes a step-by-step process of how the vulnerability was found and exploited including how to detect the offset to the EIP, finding instructions to jump to the shellcode, detecting bad characters, and crafting the payload using Metasploit's msfvenom.
*   The author specifies the tested vulnerable version of CoreFTP Server as build 583.
*   The blog post indicates the exploit will continue to work after the shellcode is executed and the service will continue to function as intended.

In summary, the provided content describes a classic buffer overflow vulnerability in CoreFTP Server that allows unauthenticated remote code execution by sending a specially crafted username during SFTP key-based authentication.
