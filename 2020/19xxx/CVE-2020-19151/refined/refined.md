{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that the template engine, Beetl, can directly call Java methods. While there are some restrictions, they can be bypassed using Java reflection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary vulnerability is remote code execution (RCE) due to the lack of sufficient restrictions on Java method calls within the template engine. Specifically, the ability to use reflection allows bypassing the intended security measures.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. In this specific example, the exploit executes the 'calc' command, which would open the calculator application, but it could be any command.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves modifying a template file within the Jfinal CMS's backend template management. The attacker inserts malicious code into a template which is then rendered and executed when accessed by a user.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Jfinal CMS backend and have access to the template management functionality."
