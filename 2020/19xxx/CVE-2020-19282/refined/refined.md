Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Jeesns application's error message handling. The application's XSS filtering mechanism is insufficient, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient XSS Filtering:** The application attempts to sanitize user input by filtering `<script>` and `<style>` tags and escaping some HTML events. However, the filtering is case-sensitive and can be bypassed by using capitalized tag names (e.g., `<Script>`).
- **Reflected XSS:** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, meaning the malicious script is injected through a user-supplied input (in this case the `msg` parameter) and reflected back in the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** JavaScript code can be used to steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the content of the website.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker can redirect the user to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting a malicious script in the `msg` parameter of the error page URL. Example: `http://localhost:8080/error?msg=<Script>prompt(/xss/)</Script>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to click on the malicious link or have the vulnerable URL accessed by the user (e.g., via email, a compromised website, etc.).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable version is Jeesns <= 1.4.2.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Knownsec on May 14, 2019.
- The application uses a class called `XssWrapper` to perform XSS filtering. However, the filtering logic in `cleanXSS`, `dealScript`, and `dealStyle` methods can be bypassed by using uppercase characters for the tags.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting a simple JavaScript `prompt` alert.
