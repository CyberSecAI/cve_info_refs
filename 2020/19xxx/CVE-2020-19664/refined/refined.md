Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-19664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a command injection flaw in the `mainfunction.cgi` script, specifically when handling the `toLogin2FA` action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The CGI script improperly handles user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the system. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the script processes SMS login requests, which allows for the injection of commands through a crafted request.
- **Insecure String Concatenation:** The script constructs a command by concatenating user-provided values, and this is passed to popen (or similar command execution function), which then executes the command.
- **SMS Service Dependency:** This vulnerability requires the SMS login service to be enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with root privileges. This could lead to complete control of the router and compromise the network it serves.
- **Full System Compromise:** With root access, attackers can modify system configurations, install malware, intercept network traffic, and potentially use the compromised router to attack other devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request with `action=toLogin2FA` to the `mainfunction.cgi` script.
- **SMS Login Service:** The SMS login service needs to be enabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
- **Phone Number Requirement:** The attacker must know the target user's phone number configured on the device for SMS login to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the device, either from the local network or through the internet if the router's web interface is exposed.
- **SMS Login Service Enabled:** The SMS login feature of the router must be enabled, and the attacker must know the phone number configured with it.
- **Knowledge of Target Phone Number:** The attacker needs to know the phone number associated with the SMS login on the target device.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker should be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the web interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered on May 4th, 2020, and patched in firmware version 1.5.1.1, released on June 17th, 2020.
- The vulnerability affects Vigor3900, Vigor2960, and Vigor300B models.
- The provided `nosec.org` content also detailed how the /etc/passwd file can be modified to gain web interface access, which could be a precursor step for a complete exploit chain.
- The `github.com` content confirms the vulnerability and links it to the `toLogin2FA` action.
