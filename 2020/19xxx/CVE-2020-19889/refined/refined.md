The provided content relates to CVE-2020-19889.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of CSRF protection mechanisms in DBHcms v1.2.0. Specifically, the absence of CSRF tokens or other similar protection methods allows an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user by tricking them into submitting malicious requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can add a new user by tricking an authenticated admin user into submitting a crafted request. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access, control of the system, and further attacks on the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTML page that includes a form that submits a request to add a user on the vulnerable application. This form is designed to be triggered by a logged-in user without their explicit knowledge.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to host an HTML page that can be accessed by the targeted victim (an admin user of the vulnerable application)
- The targeted victim must be logged in to the DBHcms application.
