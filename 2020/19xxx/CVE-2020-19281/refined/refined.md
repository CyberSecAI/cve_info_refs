Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization on the administrator login page in Jeesns <= 1.4.2. Specifically, the application's XSS filter, while attempting to block `<script>` and `<style>` tags and some event handlers, fails to handle the case-insensitive nature of HTML tags, allowing for bypass by using capitalized versions of these tags. The application logs user login attempts, including the unsanitized input, which are rendered in the administrator panel leading to stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. Malicious scripts injected through the login form are stored in the system logs and executed when an administrator views these logs.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The XSS filter is not robust, it uses regex and replace functions but doesn't handle case sensitivity, allowing bypass. This means it fails to effectively sanitize user-supplied data before storing and rendering it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of an administrator's browser session when they view the member logs.
- **Account Takeover:**  By injecting malicious scripts, an attacker could potentially gain control of the administrator's account, leading to a full system compromise.
- **Data Theft and Manipulation:** With control of the admin session, attackers can steal sensitive data, manipulate the application, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Login Form Injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the username field of the administrator login form. This can be done using a crafted payload like `<Script>prompt(/xss/)</Script>`.
- **Stored in Logs:** The system logs the login attempt including the injected payload.
- **Trigger via Admin Panel:** The XSS is triggered when an administrator views the member login logs, leading to the execution of the stored malicious script in the administrator's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Jeesns application's login page.
- **Knowledge of Login Form:** The attacker needs knowledge of where the login form is and that the username is vulnerable
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack does not require pre-existing login credentials because the injection happens at the login form itself.
