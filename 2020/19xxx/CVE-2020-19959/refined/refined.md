The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in `dl_sendmail.php` of zzcms2019.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of the `dlid` cookie value in the SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping, specifically in the following code block:

```php
if (strpos (@ $_COOKIE [' dlid], ", ") > 0) {
    $SQL ="select email from zzcms_dl where passed=1 and id in (".@$_COOKIE['dlid'].") order by id asc limit $n,$size";
} else {
    $SQL ="select email from zzcms_dl where passed=1 and id='".@$_COOKIE['dlid']."'";
}
```

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user-controlled input from the `dlid` cookie into a SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The code does not use any form of input sanitization or escaping on the `dlid` cookie value before using it in the SQL query.
- Blind SQL Injection: The provided exploit leverages blind SQL injection, as the application does not directly output the results of the injected query. The attacker infers the results based on the application's response to the injected SQL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Exfiltration: Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, including user data, passwords, and other critical information.
- Database Manipulation: An attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database.
- Full System Compromise: In severe cases, if the database user has sufficient privileges, the attacker could gain control over the underlying operating system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP Cookie: The attack vector is the HTTP `dlid` cookie. The attacker crafts a malicious `dlid` cookie to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the `dlid` cookie.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability and the vulnerable code section.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by any user who can register an account as a company type, then configure the email sending options to default.
