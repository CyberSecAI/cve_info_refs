The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Halo blogging platform. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Halo handles password protection for encrypted articles. The system only checks for the existence of a specific cookie (`halo-post-password-{postId}`) associated with the article, rather than verifying if the password itself is correct.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application relies on the presence of a cookie as authorization to access the content, without any validation of the password associated with it. This allows bypassing password protection.
*   **Lack of Proper Authentication:** The system does not perform a proper authentication process for encrypted articles. Once the cookie related to the article is set, the content is displayed regardless of the value of the cookie.
*   **Insufficient Validation:** The system validates that cookie is set, but not the content that the cookie contains.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Encrypted Content:** Attackers can bypass the password protection mechanism and view the content of encrypted articles without knowing the actual password.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cookie Manipulation:** An attacker can manually set a cookie with the expected name (`halo-post-password-{postId}`) and any arbitrary value, gaining access to the article without entering the password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know the `postId` of the encrypted article.
*   The attacker must be able to send requests with the forged cookie, typically using a web browser or HTTP client.
*  The attacker does not need to know the correct password of the article.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Chaitin Tech.
*   The issue was reported in April 2019.
*   The report includes code snippets and example HTTP traffic demonstrating the vulnerability.
