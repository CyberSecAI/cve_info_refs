```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can add a new administrator user and/or escalate an existing user to administrator privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious link or webpage that, when accessed by a logged-in administrator, sends a forged request to the vulnerable application's endpoints.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator to click on a malicious link or visit a malicious page. The attacker does not require direct access to the target system."
