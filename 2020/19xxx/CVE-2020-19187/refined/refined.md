Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-19187:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `fmt_entry` function in `progs/dump_entry.c` of the ncurses library. Specifically, when processing string capabilities, the code copies data from `srccap` to `buffer` without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The code in `fmt_entry` iterates through the `srccap` string and copies each character to `buffer`. There's a check to prevent overflowing `buffer`, but this check is only performed *after* the character has been written to buffer (line 1100). If the length of the string `srccap`, combined with other data, exceeds `buffer` size, a heap-buffer-overflow can occur.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial-of-service: The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a crash of the application using ncurses.
- Arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated in the provided text, heap-buffer-overflows can sometimes be leveraged to gain arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a special terminal capability string (`srccap`) that, when processed by `fmt_entry`, will cause the buffer to overflow, leading to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote user: As stated in the Apple security advisories for macOS, a remote user can trigger this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to supply a maliciously crafted terminal capability string to an application utilizing the vulnerable ncurses library.

**Additional Information:**
- The GitHub content provides a proof-of-concept (POC) `infotocap_poc3` that can trigger the vulnerability and cause the application to crash with a heap-buffer-overflow error. This confirms the vulnerability is easily triggered.
- The vulnerability affects ncurses versions prior to 6.1.
- NetApp also acknowledges this vulnerability in their products that incorporate GNU ncurses and recommends applying the provided patches.
