The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in Simiki version <= 1.6.2.1.

**1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The Jinja2 templating engine's `autoescape` feature is disabled by default. Simiki doesn't explicitly enable it, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts through user-controlled input.
*   **Vulnerability:** Lack of output sanitization during the rendering of Jinja2 templates.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the generated HTML pages.
*   **Attack Vector:** By providing malicious input through the `-t` argument in the `simiki.cli new` command.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create new simiki pages with malicious content.

**2. Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `yaml.load` function from the PyYAML library is used instead of `yaml.safe_load` while loading the `_config.yml` file.
*   **Vulnerability:** Usage of `yaml.load` can lead to arbitrary object instantiation by attackers because it allows the creation of arbitrary Python objects during deserialization of YAML data.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server when Simiki loads a crafted `_config.yml` file.
*   **Attack Vector:** By creating a malicious `_config.yml` file with a payload like `!!python/object/new:os.system ["/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator"]` .
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to modify the `_config.yml` file used by Simiki.

The content provides more detail than the standard CVE description which would be a placeholder. It describes the specific code location of the vulnerabilities, specific examples of the payloads for both issues, and provides links to the problematic code.
