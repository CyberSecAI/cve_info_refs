Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `admin_delete.php` file.
- The `bookisbn` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly uses the user-supplied `bookisbn` parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the ability to extract the database version.
- A successful exploit could allow an attacker to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database
    - Modify data in the database
    - Potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server, leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to `admin_delete.php` with a crafted `bookisbn` parameter.
- No login is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable application.
- The attacker doesn't require any special privileges or authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided POC uses the `updatexml` function to extract the database version, which is a common technique for exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the online book store application.
- The vulnerability was reported by zionlab@dbappsecurity.com.cn
