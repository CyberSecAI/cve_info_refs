The provided content is related to CVE-2020-19720.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow within the `AP4_IkmsAtom` class in `AP4IkmsAtom.cpp`.
- The issue arises when `AP4_RtpAtom` allocates a buffer but fails to handle memory allocation failures correctly.
- When memory allocation fails, a null pointer is used, and a `memcpy` operation is attempted to copy data into the null pointer, resulting in a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:**  A memory allocation failure leads to the program attempting to write to a null pointer, effectively a buffer overflow.
- **Unhandled Memory Allocation Failure:** The code does not properly handle the case where memory allocation fails, which leads to the null pointer dereference and crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a program crash due to the attempt to write to a null pointer.
- The AddressSanitizer logs confirm the memory allocation failure and the subsequent check failure.
- Potential denial of service due to application crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Input File:** The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a crafted MP4 file using the `mp42aac` tool.
- The provided proof-of-concept file `poc_input4.zip` can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted MP4 file as input to the affected application `mp42aac`.
- No specific privileges or position is needed beyond being able to supply the malicious input file.
