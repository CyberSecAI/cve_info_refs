Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-19716:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `exiv2` library when handling crafted metadata of CRW (Canon Raw) images. Specifically, the `DataBuf` class in `types.cpp` does not properly check if memory allocation succeeds (i.e., if `malloc` returns a null pointer) before using `memcpy` to write to the allocated buffer. If `malloc` fails, `memcpy` will write to a null pointer, causing a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** Writing past the bounds of an allocated buffer, or to an invalid memory address (null pointer in this case).
- **Lack of Null Pointer Check:** Failure to validate if the memory allocation was successful prior to writing to the memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability leads to a crash due to an access of invalid memory, rendering the application unusable.
- Although the description notes "remotely exploitable DoS vulnerabilities in software using exiv2", further detail on remote exploitation isn't provided.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted CRW image:**  A malicious actor needs to create a specially crafted CRW image file that triggers the flawed memory allocation and writing within `exiv2`.
- **Input processing:** The vulnerable code is triggered when the application uses exiv2 to parse the crafted CRW image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must be able to provide the crafted CRW image to an application that uses a vulnerable version of the `exiv2` library.
- No specific information about remote exploitation is available, however the provided information indicates it is possible.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported against Exiv2 version 0.27.1, which was used during the analysis, and fixed in a later version.
- The ASan (AddressSanitizer) output provides details about the execution path leading to the crash, pinpointing the vulnerable code in `types.cpp` during memory allocation.
- A proof-of-concept input file named "poc_input2.zip" is included, which allows for easy reproduction of the vulnerability.
- The Debian LTS advisory mentions this vulnerability, and indicates a fix for Debian 10.
