{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses a user-controlled value `$data['state']` to construct a file path in the `$index_file` variable which is then included using `require`. This allows an attacker to control which file is included, leading to a local file inclusion vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server's file system by manipulating the `$data['state']` variable. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure, code execution if the attacker manages to include files containing PHP code, or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP request parameter manipulation"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the server to influence the value of `$data['state']`. They also need knowledge of the file structure to include appropriate files. Additionally, the server must be running PHP versions prior to 5.3.4 and have `magic_quotes_gpc` set to off."
