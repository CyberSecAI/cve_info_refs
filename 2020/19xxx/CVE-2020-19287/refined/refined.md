Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in the Jeesns group posts functionality. While the application attempts to filter XSS using `XssWrapper`, it can be bypassed due to case-insensitive matching. Specifically, the filter only looks for lowercase tags such as `<script>` and `<style>` and certain HTML event attributes. It does not account for uppercase variants like `<Script>`. Additionally, the data is saved directly to the database without any further filtering, and then rendered in the frontend without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS because malicious JavaScript code is stored in the database, and executed when the group post is viewed by other users.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application's XSS filter (`XssWrapper`) has a case-sensitive bypass. The regex patterns and `replaceAll` method used within `cleanXSS` are case-sensitive, making it possible to inject malicious code by using capitalized versions of tags and attributes that are supposed to be filtered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view the group posts.
*   **Session Hijacking/Account Takeover:** Malicious scripts could be used to steal user session cookies or redirect users to phishing pages, potentially leading to account compromise.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The injected scripts could potentially be used to manipulate or steal data, modify displayed content, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Group Post Title Field:** The attacker injects the XSS payload into the title field of a group post.
*   **User Interaction:** The XSS is triggered when any user views the group post containing the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Jeesns platform.
*   **Group Member:** The attacker must be a member of a group in order to create a post.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code:** The `XssWrapper.java` class attempts to filter XSS, specifically the `cleanXSS` method is vulnerable due to case-sensitive filters.
*   **Bypass:** XSS is bypassed using capitalized tags such as `<Script>`. The data is directly saved in `GroupTopicServiceImpl.save()` without additional filtering and rendered to the frontend as is.
*   **Affected Versions:** Jeesns version <= 1.4.2
