Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Issue 1: CVE-2020-19481 (Likely related to issue #1265)**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  A left shift of a negative value occurs within the `gf_m2ts_process_pmt` function at `mpegts.c:2373`. This happens because the code attempts to perform a bitwise left shift operation on a negative integer which is undefined behavior in C/C++.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Undefined Behavior:** The left shift of a negative value is undefined behavior in C/C++, leading to unpredictable results and crashes.
    *   **Invalid memory access:** The crash occurs due to an invalid read within the `gf_m2ts_process_pmt` function.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability causes a crash in the MP4Box tool, potentially leading to a denial of service.
*  **Attack vectors:**
    *   A specially crafted MPEG-2 TS file is provided as input to MP4Box using the `-info` option.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious input file to MP4Box.

**Issue 2: (Likely related to issue #1266)**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A left shift operation of a large number (128) by 24 places is performed in `mpegts.c:2236`. This exceeds the range of the `int` data type, resulting in a runtime error.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Integer Overflow:** The left shift operation causes an integer overflow, leading to a crash.
    *   **Invalid memory access**: The crash also occurs due to invalid read in `gf_m2ts_process_pmt`.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability causes a crash in the MP4Box tool.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   A malicious MPEG-2 TS input file triggers the faulty left shift when processed by MP4Box using the `-info` option.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious input file to MP4Box.

**Issue 3: (Likely related to issue #1267)**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The code attempts to access a member of a null pointer within the `gf_m2ts_process_pmt` function at `mpegts.c:2541`. This indicates that the `es` array within `GF_M2TS_Demuxer` is not being initialized properly when processing a specific crafted mpegts file.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Null Pointer Dereference:** Accessing a member of a null pointer results in a crash.
    *   **Invalid memory access**: The crash also occurs due to invalid read in `gf_m2ts_process_pmt`.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability causes a crash in the MP4Box tool, potentially leading to a denial of service.
*  **Attack vectors:**
    *  A specially crafted MPEG-2 TS file is provided as input to MP4Box using the `-info` option.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious input file to MP4Box.

**Additional Notes:**
*   All three issues were reported by the same user, "strongcourage," indicating a similar pattern of fuzzing and vulnerability discovery.
*   All three crashes were located within the `mpegts.c` file and within the same `gf_m2ts_process_pmt` function and were triggered by processing crafted mpegts files with the `MP4Box -info` command.
*   The issues were addressed by commit `2320eb7` which fixed a potential crash in TS processing. This commit modifies the `mpegts.c` file, suggesting that all these issues are related and likely fixed by the same patch. The commit diff indicates the fix involved removing redundant code that caused the vulnerability related to the `es` array.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

The provided content describes three related vulnerabilities all stemming from improper handling of MPEG-2 TS files within the GPAC library, specifically inside `mpegts.c`. These issues are triggered by providing crafted TS files as input to MP4Box. The vulnerabilities include undefined behavior due to left shifting of negative values, integer overflows due to excessively large shifts, and null pointer dereferences due to not correctly initializing array. The result of these issues is crashes within the MP4Box tool, which can lead to denial of service.
