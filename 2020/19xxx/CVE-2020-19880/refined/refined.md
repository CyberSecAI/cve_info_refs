Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-19880:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `Name` field within the `dbhcms\types.php` file does not use the `htmlspecialchars` function, which is designed to encode special characters to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML or JavaScript.

**Weakness:** Failure to sanitize user input, specifically within the "Name" field when creating or editing a type in the dbhcms\types.php file.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A remote unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'Name' field of a type. When an authenticated user views the page containing this data, the injected script will execute in their browser. This can lead to hijacking of the user's session, stealing sensitive information, or performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vector:**
  - The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code and submits this within the `Name` field.
  - The vulnerable application stores this unsanitized payload in the database.
  - When a user views a page displaying the unsanitized data from the database, the malicious JavaScript code will execute in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  -  No authentication is required to inject the malicious payload. Any unauthenticated user can trigger the vulnerability.
  - The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the application to submit the malicious code.
