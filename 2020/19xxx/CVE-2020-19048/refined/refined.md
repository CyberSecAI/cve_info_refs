The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MyBB version 1.8.20.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the "Title" field when adding a new forum. MyBB attempts to strip `<script>` tags but fails to do so recursively.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability.
- Inadequate input sanitization.
- Non-recursive filtering of `<script>` tags.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the user's browser when visiting the affected page.
- Potential for session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious code into the "Title" field of a new forum via a POST request.
- The crafted payload will be stored and executed when other users view the forum list page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Requires an authenticated user with administrator access to the forum management section.
- Ability to make a crafted POST request to the `/Upload/admin/index.php?module=forum-management&action=add` endpoint.

**Payload:**
The following payload is used to bypass the filtering:
`"><script>pt>alert(1)</script>/`
