- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A NULL pointer dereference in the `EmbedStream::getChar()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code attempts to access a memory location through a NULL pointer, which results in a segmentation fault.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The application crashes, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted PDF file can trigger the NULL pointer dereference by exploiting the image processing functionality of `pdf2json`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious PDF file to the vulnerable `pdf2json` application.
