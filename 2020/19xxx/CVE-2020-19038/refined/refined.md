The provided content is related to CVE-2020-19038.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `delBackup` function, which allows arbitrary file deletion by accepting a `fileName` parameter that is not sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary file deletion due to path traversal vulnerability. The `fileName` parameter is used directly in constructing the file path without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access and delete files outside of the intended backup directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `fileName` parameter in the `delBackup` endpoint. This can lead to data loss, denial of service, or even compromise of the system depending on what files are deleted.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `delBackup` endpoint. The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the endpoint, providing a `fileName` parameter with path traversal sequences.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable endpoint and know the valid parameter names (`type` and `fileName`).
- The attacker also needs to be authenticated as an admin user to access the `/admin/backup/delBackup` endpoint.
