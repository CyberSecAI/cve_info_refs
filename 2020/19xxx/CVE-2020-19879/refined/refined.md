The provided content relates to CVE-2020-19879.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists because there is no security filter applied to the `$_GET['dbhcms_pid']` variable in `dbhcms\page.php` line 107. This allows for the injection of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the lack of input sanitization on the `$_GET['dbhcms_pid']` variable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, leading to the potential hijacking of other users' sessions. When an authenticated admin user accesses a page where the injected code is rendered, the malicious script is executed within the context of the admin user's session, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions on the administrator's behalf.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a URL with a malicious payload in the `dbhcms_pid` parameter and accessing that URL. The payload is stored in the database and triggered on subsequent page loads.
   Example URL: `http://localhost:8089/?dbhcms_params=2&dbhcms_pid=2222<img/src/onerror=alert(1)>`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No authentication is required to inject the malicious code. However, a logged-in admin is required to trigger the stored XSS.
