- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An invalid write occurs within the `CCITTFaxStream::lookChar` function due to a malformed CCITTFax stream in a PDF file, leading to out-of-bounds access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Invalid memory write: The `CCITTFaxStream::lookChar` function writes to memory outside the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.
    - Invalid memory read: The same function also attempts to read from invalid memory locations, contributing to the crash.
    - Out-of-bounds access: The root cause appears to stem from the processing of malformed CCITTFax data leading to a buffer overflow/underflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The exploitation results in a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV), causing the program to crash. This can lead to denial of service, and potentially further exploitation if the vulnerability allows for more than just a crash.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious PDF file with a crafted CCITTFax stream can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted PDF file to the application for processing. The attacker's position is external.
