Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and validation during the file upload process in the "backup" plugin of Bludit. Specifically, the plugin allows uploading a ZIP archive and restoring its contents, including PHP files, without adequate checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The backup plugin allows the upload of arbitrary ZIP files without verifying the content.
*   **Lack of File Type Validation:** The system does not validate the file types contained within the ZIP archive. It allows the inclusion of executable files like PHP scripts.
*   **Insecure File Restoration:** The plugin extracts the ZIP archive directly into the `bl-content/uploads` directory, which is accessible via web browser.
*   **Lack of sanitization:** The plugin doesn't sanitize file names or paths in the uploaded archive, allowing overwriting of existing files or injection into directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a ZIP file containing a malicious PHP script, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. In the provided example, the uploaded `1.php` file allows the attacker to execute phpinfo, and establish a backdoor for further access and control over the server.
*   **Full Server Compromise:** Gaining arbitrary code execution can lead to complete compromise of the Bludit server, data theft, and other malicious activities.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker can modify files and deface the website hosted on the Bludit CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload via Backup Plugin:** The attacker leverages the file upload functionality within the "backup" plugin.
*   **ZIP archive containing malicious PHP files:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted ZIP archive.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrator Access:** The attacker needs administrative access to the Bludit instance to activate the "backup" plugin and use the restore functionality.
*   **Ability to craft malicious ZIP archive:** The attacker must have the ability to create a ZIP archive containing malicious PHP code.

**Additional details:**

The vulnerability was reported in Bludit v3.13.0. The attacker needs to:

1.  Activate the 'backup' plugin.
2.  Upload a specially crafted zip file containing a PHP file in the `bl-content/uploads` directory via the "Restore Backup" functionality.
3.  Access the uploaded PHP file through the web browser to execute the included malicious code.
