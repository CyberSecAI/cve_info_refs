Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2020-19609:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow in the `tiff_expand_colormap()` function when parsing TIFF files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `tiff_expand_colormap()` function allocates a buffer based on the image width, samples per pixel, and image length. However, during the processing loop, it writes data based on the assumption of a fixed number of color components when `extrasamples` is not 0, without considering the actual number of components defined in the tiff file. This leads to out-of-bounds writes and buffer overflow when extra samples exist in the TIFF file, potentially overwriting heap memory. Specifically, the code writes 6 bytes for the color components and 1 or 2 bytes for the alpha component, totaling 7 or 8 bytes per pixel, while the buffer allocation only accounts for (tiff->samplesperpixel + 2) * 2 bytes per pixel.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service due to the heap-based buffer overflow, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a crafted TIFF file, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability during the parsing of the image within the `tiff_expand_colormap()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted TIFF file that will be processed by the vulnerable software. This usually means that the attacker can influence the input to the `mupdf` library.
