    Buffer overflow in the my_getline function in jstest_main.c allows remote attackers
    to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a crafted file.

CVE-2017-6060

    Stack-based buffer overflow in jstest_main.c allows remote attackers
    to have unspecified impact via a crafted image.

CVE-2018-10289

    An infinite loop in the fz_skip_space function of the pdf/pdf-xref.c file.
    A remote adversary could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of
    service via a crafted pdf file.

CVE-2018-1000036

    Multiple memory leaks in the PDF parser allow an attacker to cause a denial
    of service (memory leak) via a crafted file.

CVE-2020-19609

    A heap based buffer over-write in tiff_expand_colormap() function when parsing TIFF
    files allowing attackers to cause a denial of service.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
