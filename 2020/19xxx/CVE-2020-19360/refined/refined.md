    "1": "The provided content relates to CVE-2020-19360.",
    "2": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to an insecure implementation in the `FileLog_logWrapper` function in FHEM 6.0, which allows including arbitrary files through the `file` parameter without proper sanitization.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to include arbitrary files from the server, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure such as `/etc/passwd`.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `/fhem/FileLog_logWrapper` with a malicious `file` parameter.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the FHEM server. No special privileges or positioning is required other than having network access to the server."
