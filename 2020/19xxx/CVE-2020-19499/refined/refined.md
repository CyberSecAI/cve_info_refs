The provided content relates to CVE-2020-19499.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing check for the existence of an "iref" box in the HEIF file. When a derived image references an "iref" box that does not exist, the code attempts to access it, leading to a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing check for the existence of an "iref" box.
- Dereferencing a null pointer or accessing invalid memory when the "iref" box is missing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault (SEGV) leading to a crash of the application processing the crafted HEIF file.
- Potential denial-of-service if the application is repeatedly crashed.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted HEIF file that lacks a required "iref" box.
- Exploiting this via a conversion tool using the vulnerable `libheif` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create or modify HEIF files.
- Ability to supply the crafted HEIF file to an application that uses `libheif` for processing.
