**Vulnerability:** Arbitrary File Deletion in MetInfo CMS v7.0.0

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the `indeximg` field when deleting a column within the MetInfo CMS. The `_delolumn` function in `/app/system/column/admin/index.class.php` uses the `fileUnlink` function which deletes the file specified in the `indeximg` field. Critically, this `indeximg` field can be arbitrarily specified by a background user (via the column picture upload functionality). This allows a malicious user to specify a system file path in `indeximg`, and upon column deletion, trigger the deletion of that arbitrary file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to delete any file accessible to the webserver process by specifying its path in the `indeximg` field.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The CMS lacks proper input validation and sanitization of the `indeximg` field. It doesn't check whether the specified file path belongs to a user uploaded image or any other restriction.
*   **Unsafe File Operations:** The `fileUnlink` function is used directly on user-supplied input without proper verification, enabling the deletion of arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Loss:** An attacker can delete critical files on the server, potentially causing data loss and disruption of services.
*   **System Instability:** Deletion of key system files can lead to system instability, crashes, or rendering the application unusable.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Arbitrary file deletion can be a stepping stone for more severe attacks. For instance, an attacker could delete application files and then upload a modified version to gain further access or control.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specifically crafted POST request to `/admin/?n=column&c=index&a=doEditorsave`.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The request uses `multipart/form-data` to send the necessary parameters.
*   **`indeximg` Parameter:** The `indeximg` parameter within the POST request is used to specify the path of the file to be deleted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the column management section in the MetInfo CMS backend. This means a user that has the ability to create/edit column content and upload images for columns.
*   **Knowledge of Target Path:** The attacker needs to know the full path to the file they want to delete on the server.

**Technical Details:**
The provided POC demonstrates the exploitation process:
1.  A POST request is sent to `admin/?n=column&c=index&a=doEditorsave` with the `indeximg` field set to the target file path.
2.  The column associated with the POST request is deleted, triggering the arbitrary file deletion via the `fileUnlink` function.

In summary, this is a serious vulnerability as it allows an authenticated user to arbitrarily delete files on the server through a misconfiguration of the column deletion functionality.
