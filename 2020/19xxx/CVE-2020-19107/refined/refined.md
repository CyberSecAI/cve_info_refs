The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the `edit_book.php` file of an online book store project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `isbn` parameter within the `edit_book.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability in the `edit_book.php` script via the `isbn` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (e.g., retrieving sensitive information like database version).
    - Data modification.
    - Data deletion.
    - Full compromise of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `edit_book.php`.
- The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `isbn` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No authentication required.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web server.
- No prior knowledge of the system is required to execute a basic SQL injection attack (as demonstrated in the provided PoC).

**Technical Details:**

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability:
```
POST /edit_book.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.11.33.206:8888

isbn=xx%27+or+updatexml%281%2Cconcat%280x7e%2C%28version%28%29%29%29%2C0%29+--+a&save_change=1
```

The PoC injects the following SQL payload into the `isbn` parameter:
```sql
xx' or updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(version())),0) -- a
```
This payload attempts to retrieve the database version using the `updatexml` function, which indicates an exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability. The injection occurs because of the lack of sanitization or prepared statements when handling the `isbn` parameter within the `edit_book.php` script.
