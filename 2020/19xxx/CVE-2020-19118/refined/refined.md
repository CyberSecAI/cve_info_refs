The provided content describes a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in yzmcms v5.2.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises because user-supplied data is not effectively filtered before being displayed in the HTML page. Specifically, the `site_code` parameter is vulnerable.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS. User-provided input is not sanitized before being stored and rendered in the application. This allows the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, which will then be executed in the browser of any user who views the affected page. This can lead to various consequences, such as:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the website.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `site_code` parameter in the `admin/index/init.html` page. By injecting JavaScript code into this parameter, an attacker can achieve persistent XSS.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - An attacker needs to have the ability to input data into the vulnerable `site_code` parameter.
    - The attacker does not need to be directly present when a victim views the page because the malicious script is stored in the application. Any user that views the affected page will trigger the XSS payload.
