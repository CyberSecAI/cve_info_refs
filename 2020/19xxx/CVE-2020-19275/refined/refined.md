The provided content describes a path disclosure vulnerability in the `dhcms` application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly handle invalid input when processing file paths, leading to an error message that discloses the full physical path of the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Disclosure:** The application reveals the server's internal file system structure and pathnames through error messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** Attackers can gain knowledge of the server's filesystem structure, potentially aiding in further attacks. This information can reveal details about the application's installation directory and potentially sensitive files.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by appending invalid characters to the `name` parameter in the URL, specifically within the `DhCms/Form/index` module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the web application and manipulate the URL parameters. No authentication is required.
