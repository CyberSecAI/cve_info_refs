{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not filter or validate the new file name during the file renaming process in the background template management, allowing an attacker to rename uploaded files to malicious extensions (e.g., jsp).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insecure file renaming functionality",
    "Lack of input validation on new file names",
     "Allows arbitrary file renaming"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload a file with a safe extension (e.g., .jpg) containing malicious code, then rename it to a server-executable extension (e.g., .jsp) to achieve arbitrary code execution, leading to a potential system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP request with the mode parameter set to rename",
    "old parameter specifying the file to rename",
    "new parameter specifying the new file name including the malicious extension"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Must have access to the admin panel",
    "Must be able to upload files",
     "Must know file path to rename"
  ]
}
