Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is insufficient input validation and sanitization of user-provided content in the Jeesns Weibo functionality. Specifically, the XSS filter implemented is case-sensitive which can be easily bypassed by using uppercase characters in the HTML tags. Additionally, the weibo data is stored in the database without further filtering, and the front end renders the data directly leading to stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. Malicious scripts are saved in the database and executed when other users view the affected content (Weibo posts).
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application's XSS filter is inadequate because it only filters lowercase `<script>` and `<style>` tags and certain HTML event attributes, but is case-sensitive, allowing bypass via capitalization.
- **Lack of Output Encoding:** The application does not encode the user-provided data when displaying it on the front end, allowing stored scripts to execute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into Weibo posts.
- **Account Hijacking:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, the attacker could potentially steal user session cookies or other sensitive data.
- **Phishing/Redirects:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites or display phishing pages.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of web pages and/or inject unwanted content.
- **Other Malicious Activities:** An attacker could use injected scripts for a variety of other malicious purposes, limited only by the capabilities of JavaScript.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Weibo Posting:** The attack vector is through the Weibo posting functionality in the Jeesns application.
- **Payload Injection:** An attacker inserts the malicious script payload (e.g., `<Script>prompt(/xss/)</Script>`) into the content of a new weibo post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Registered User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account within the Jeesns application to post Weibo messages.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know basic HTML/Javascript to craft a malicious payload.
