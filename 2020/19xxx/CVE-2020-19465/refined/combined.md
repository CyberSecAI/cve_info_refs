Hi,

Our fuzzer found a crash due to an invalid read on the function ObjectStream::getObject (the latest commit [b671b64](https://github.com/flexpaper/pdf2json/commit/b671b647a7e487b021744f330b8dd2d6ccfa8103) on master - version 0.70).

PoC: [https://github.com/strongcourage/PoCs/blob/master/pdf2json\_b671b64/PoC\_segv\_ObjectStream::getObject](https://github.com/strongcourage/PoCs/blob/master/pdf2json_b671b64/PoC_segv_ObjectStream%3A%3AgetObject)
