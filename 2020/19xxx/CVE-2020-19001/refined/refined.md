The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in Simiki <= v1.6.2.1: a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability and a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.

**1. XSS Vulnerability**
*   **Root Cause:** The Jinja2 templating engine's `autoescape` setting is set to `False` by default. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML, including malicious JavaScript code, into generated pages.
*   **Weakness:** Improper output sanitization/encoding when rendering user-provided content.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into generated pages that will execute when a user visits the site. This could lead to session hijacking, phishing attacks, or other client-side attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** By injecting malicious script within user-provided content when creating a new page or category through `simiki.cli`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have the ability to provide user input used within template rendering.

**2. RCE Vulnerability**
*   **Root Cause:** Use of `yaml.load()` instead of `yaml.safe_load()` when loading configuration file. `yaml.load()` is unsafe and allows for arbitrary object instantiation, enabling code execution.
*   **Weakness:** Unsafe deserialization of YAML configuration files.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server when simiki loads a malicious `_config.yml` file, taking control of the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** By providing a malicious configuration file `_config.yml` containing code that will be executed.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to replace or modify the application configuration file `_config.yml`.
