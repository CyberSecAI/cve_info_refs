- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated administrator.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can add a new administrator user to the system, potentially gaining full control over the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a request to the vulnerable endpoint. The victim administrator, while logged into the application, visits this malicious page and the form is submitted automatically due to the absence of CSRF protection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious page they control.
