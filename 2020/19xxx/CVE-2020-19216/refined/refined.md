The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the user and group permissions manager of Piwigo, a photo gallery software.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `admin/user_perm.php` and `admin/group_perm.php` files.
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when moving albums between a user's allowed albums and the total list of available albums.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection is present.
- Specifically, the injection occurs when the user moves an album from the right to the left within the permissions management interface.
- The `user_id` parameter in the request `admin.php?page=user_perm&user_id=1` appears to be vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database.
- This allows attackers to potentially:
  -  Extract sensitive information from the database (e.g. via `database()`).
  -  Modify or delete data.
  -  Potentially execute arbitrary code on the server depending on database permissions and configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to `admin.php` with the `page` parameter set to `user_perm` or `group_perm` and providing a malicious payload when moving albums through the user interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to access the Piwigo administrative interface, indicating a need for elevated privileges.
- They need to have a user or group with a private album setup.
-  They need to be able to move an album from the right pane to the left pane in the user/group permission manager
- An attacker would send a request such as `http://xx.xx.xx.xx/admin.php?page=user_perm&user_id=1` and insert a payload such as  `1 and if(ascii(substr(database(),1,1))>97,1,sleep(5))` when moving the album.
