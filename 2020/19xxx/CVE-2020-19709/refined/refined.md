The provided content describes a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Feehicms application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to "lax filtering of tag parameters", meaning the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `tag` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Insufficient input validation and sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.
- This code can be executed in the browser of other users, leading to potential information theft, session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `tag` parameter in a GET request.
- The vulnerable URL structure is `http://127.0.0.1/index.php?r=search%2Ftag&tag=<script>alert(123)</script>`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter, and then trick or wait for a user to visit the URL, thus executing the malicious Javascript in the user's browser.
