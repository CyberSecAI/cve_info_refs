Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in the Jeesns private messaging feature. Specifically, the application fails to properly filter user-supplied content before storing it in the database and rendering it on the frontend.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. User-provided input, specifically within private messages, is not adequately sanitized.
- **Insufficient Input Filtering:** The application attempts to filter `<script>` and `<style>` tags and some HTML events. However, it does not perform case-insensitive matching, which allows for bypass using capitalization. The `sentMsg` method in `MessageServiceImpl.java` directly saves the unsanitized input to the database, further exacerbating the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit would allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, which would be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected private message.
- **Potential Account Compromise:** An attacker could potentially perform actions on behalf of the victim user (session hijacking), steal sensitive information (cookies or session tokens), redirect users to malicious websites, deface the user interface, or perform other unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Private Messages:** The primary attack vector is through the private messaging feature of the Jeesns application.
- **Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code, such as `<Script>prompt(/xss/)</Script>`, and sends this payload as a private message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Registered User:** The attacker must be a registered user of the Jeesns application.
- **Ability to Send Messages:** The attacker must have the ability to send private messages to other users, particularly the administrator in the described exploit.
