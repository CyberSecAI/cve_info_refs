{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input, specifically the `$_POST['pageparam_insert_description']` variable, before using it in a context where it will be rendered in HTML.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of sanitization using `htmlspecialchars`.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes within the browsers of other users who access the affected page. This can lead to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker must be authenticated as an administrator to access the vulnerable page. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via the `Description` field in the parameter settings of a page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated administrator user to access the page configuration, and be able to modify the `Description` field."
