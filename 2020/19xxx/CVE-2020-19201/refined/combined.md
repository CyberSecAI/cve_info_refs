# 2.4.4-p3 New Features and Changes[Â¶](#p3-new-features-and-changes "Link to this heading")

pfSenseÂ® software version 2.4.4-p3 addresses security and other issues found in
[2.4.4-p2](2-4-4-p2.html).

Tip

For those who have not yet updated to 2.4.5-p1, consult the [previous
release notes](index.html) and [blog posts for those releases](https://www.netgate.com/blog/tag/releases) to read all important
information and warnings before proceeding.

Warning

The upcoming pfSense release version 2.5.0 deprecates the built-in load
balancer, and all related code has been removed as it is not compatible with
FreeBSD 12. Plan migrations to alternate solutions such as the HAProxy
package now.

See the [2.5.0 release notes](2-5-0.html) for more information.

|  | Topic: XSS vulnerability in the WebGUI |
|  |  |
|  | Category: pfSense Base System |
|  | Module: webgui |
|  | Announced: 2019-05-20 |
|  | Credits: Dharmesh Baskaran -- https://www.linkedin.com/in/dharmeshbaskaran |
|  | CVE ID: CVE-2020-19201 |
|  | Affects: pfSense software versions <= 2.4.4-p2 |
|  | Corrected: 2019-05-03 19:24:43 UTC (pfSense/master, pfSense 2.5.0) |
|  | 2019-05-03 19:24:43 UTC (pfSense/RELENG\_2\_4\_4, pfSense 2.4.4-pX) |
|  | The latest revision of this advisory is available at |

|  | https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/9499 |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | 0. Revision History |
|  |  |
|  | v1.1 2021-05-20 Added CVE ID |
|  | v1.0 2019-05-20 Initial SA draft |
|  |  |
|  | I. Background |
|  |  |
|  | pfSense® software is a free network firewall distribution based on the |
|  | FreeBSD operating system. The pfSense software distribution includes third- |
|  | party free software packages for additional functionality, and provides most of |
|  | the functionality of common commercial firewalls. |
|  |  |
|  | The majority of users of pfSense software have never installed or used a stock |
|  | FreeBSD system. Unlike similar GNU/Linux-based firewall distributions, there |
|  | is no need for any UNIX knowledge. The command line is never used, and there |
|  | is no need to ever manually edit any rule sets. Instead, pfSense software |
|  | includes a web interface for the configuration of all included components. |
|  | Users familiar with commercial firewalls will quickly understand the web |
|  | interface, while those unfamiliar with commercial-grade firewalls may encounter |
|  | a short learning curve. |
|  |  |
|  | II. Problem Description |
|  |  |
|  | A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in |
|  | status\_filter\_reload.php, a page in the pfSense software WebGUI, on version |
|  | 2.4.4-p2 and earlier. |
|  |  |
|  | The page did not encode output from the filter reload process, and a stored XSS |
|  | was possible via the descr (description) parameter on NAT rules. |
|  |  |
|  | III. Impact |
|  |  |
|  | Due to the lack of proper encoding on the affected parameters susceptible to |
|  | XSS, arbitrary JavaScript could be executed in the user's browser. The user's |
|  | session cookie or other information from the session may be compromised. |
|  |  |
|  | IV. Workaround |
|  |  |
|  | No workaround. To help mitigate the problem on older releases, use one or more |
|  | of the following: |
|  | \* Do not give firewall administrators access to pages or functions which allow |
|  | writing arbitrary files to the firewall. |
|  | \* Limit access to the affected pages to trusted administrators only. |
|  | \* Do not log into the firewall with the same browser used for non- |
|  | administrative web browsing. |
|  |  |
|  | V. Solution |
|  |  |
|  | Users can upgrade to version 2.4.4-p3 or later. This upgrade may be performed in |
|  | the web interface or from the console. |
|  |  |
|  | See https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/install/upgrade-guide.html |
|  |  |
|  | Users may also apply the relevant revisions below using the System Patches |
|  | package to obtain the fix. |

## Download Guide

You can determine the files needed for your install by reading the rest of this page for guidance.

#### Architecture Options

 | AMD64 (64-bit) | If you have a 64-bit capable CPU, use the amd64 version. The amd64 architecture (which works even on Intel 64-bit CPUs) can address more memory and may have other performance advantages, but requires a compatible CPU. |
| --- | --- |
| Netgate ADI | The Netgate ADI image only supports a serial installation from memstick and does not come with VGA option. If you purchased a Netgate product, refer to the [product manual](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/solutions) for your appliance to see which reinstall image you need. |

#### Installer Options

 | USB Memstick | The USB memstick image is meant to be [written to a USB flash drive](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/hardware/writing-disk-images.html) before use and includes an installer that installs pfSense software to the hard drive on your system. This is the preferred means of running pfSense software. The entire hard drive will be overwritten, dual booting with another OS is not supported. |
| --- | --- |
| DVD Image (ISO) | The DVD Image (ISO) Installer is used to create a DVD version used to install on virtual machines or systems with a DVD drive. |

#### Filename Guide
