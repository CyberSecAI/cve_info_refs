The provided content is related to CVE-2020-19717.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper size checks when allocating memory within `Ap48bdlAtom.cpp`. Specifically, the code attempts to allocate a large chunk of memory without verifying if the requested size is valid, leading to allocation failure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unchecked Memory Allocation Size:** The code does not validate the size of the requested memory allocation before calling `malloc`, which can cause `malloc` to fail and return `NULL`.
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** When `malloc` fails and returns `NULL`, the code attempts to dereference this `NULL` pointer, leading to a crash. This is evidenced by the ASAN report showing that `AP4_DataBuffer` constructor fails with a `NULL` pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability leads to a crash of the application due to a null pointer dereference, effectively resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** A specially crafted input file can trigger the faulty memory allocation in `AP4_8bdlAtom::AP4_8bdlAtom` by providing a large size which results in allocation failure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide the application with a malicious input file (e.g., `poc_input6.zip`).
- No special privileges or position required beyond the ability to provide input to the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs within the `AP4_8bdlAtom::AP4_8bdlAtom` function during the parsing of an MP4 file.
- The provided ASAN report shows the exact call stack leading to the crash, pinpointing the problematic code locations.
- The issue was found using fuzzing tools, which are used to automatically find vulnerabilities.
