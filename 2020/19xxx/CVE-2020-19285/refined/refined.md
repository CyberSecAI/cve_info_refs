Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is insufficient input sanitization of user-provided data when creating or editing groups within the Jeesns application. Specifically, the application's XSS filter is bypassed due to a lack of case-insensitive handling of HTML tags and event handlers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. Malicious JavaScript code injected by a user into a group's name field is stored in the database and executed when an administrator views the group application.
*   **Insufficient Input Filtering:** The `XssWrapper` class attempts to filter out `<script>` and `<style>` tags and common event handlers, but does not handle case-insensitivity. This allows an attacker to bypass the filter by using capitalized versions of these tags and event handlers such as `<Script>` instead of `<script>`.
*   **Lack of Output Encoding:** When group information is displayed to the administrator, there is no output encoding, which means the stored malicious payload is rendered directly in the administrator's browser, leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of an administrator viewing the group application page.
*   **Account Takeover:** The attacker could potentially perform actions on behalf of the administrator, such as stealing session cookies, manipulating data, or performing administrative functions.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker might also deface the web page or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Input:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a group's name or another field that is not properly sanitized during the group application process.
*   **Database Storage:** The malicious payload is stored in the application's database without sanitization.
*   **Administrator Access:** The attack is triggered when an administrator views the group application and the stored XSS payload is rendered in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Jeesns application with the ability to apply for group creation.
*   **Knowledge of XSS Payloads:** The attacker must have the knowledge to craft an XSS payload that bypasses the existing filters.
*   **Admin Interaction:** The vulnerability relies on interaction from an administrator to trigger the malicious script. The attacker does not have to be an administrator, but needs the administrator to view the content that contains the malicious payload.
*   **Application Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the Jeesns application to apply for a group.

**More detail than the official CVE description:**

* The provided content offers a detailed analysis of the vulnerable code (XssWrapper, GroupServiceImpl), outlining the specific filtering bypass using case insensitivity. It shows how the stored XSS occurs in the application and illustrates the attack vector including user registration, application of a new group with a malicious payload and the trigger when an administrator reviews the application.
