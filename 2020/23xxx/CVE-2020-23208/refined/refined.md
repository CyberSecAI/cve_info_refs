- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient sanitization of user-provided input in the "to email address(es)" field of the "Send a Campaign" feature. Specifically, the application fails to properly HTML entity encode the reflected input, allowing for injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application attempts to remove script tags but this is insufficient protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to private data theft, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, and other harmful operations under the guise of the vulnerable site.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated attacker can inject a malicious payload (e.g., `<svg/onload=prompt(1)>`) into the "to email address(es)" field during the campaign creation process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid authenticated user account within the vulnerable phplist application.
