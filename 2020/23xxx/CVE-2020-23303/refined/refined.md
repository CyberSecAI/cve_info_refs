- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `jmem_pools_collect_empty` function within the JerryScript engine. The overflow is triggered during garbage collection when processing a specially crafted JavaScript input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow. The provided stack trace indicates that the overflow happens due to an out-of-bounds read in `jmem_pools_collect_empty`. This function is responsible for collecting empty memory pools, which suggests a problem during memory management when dealing with specific objects created in the javascript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A heap-buffer-overflow can lead to denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or other unintended behavior. In this specific instance, it causes the program to crash with an AddressSanitizer error, which can be leveraged to cause a denial of service. The stack trace shows this crashing occurred during garbage collection.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted Javascript code. The vulnerability is triggered when the crafted code is executed by the JerryScript engine, specifically when a garbage collection cycle is performed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to provide the malicious Javascript input to be parsed by the JerryScript engine. This could be through a web application, a local file, or other mechanisms where the engine processes javascript code.
