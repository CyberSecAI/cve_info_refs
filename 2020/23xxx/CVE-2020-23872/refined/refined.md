Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in the `pdf2xml` tool, specifically related to the provided PoCs:

**1. NULL Pointer Dereference in `TextPage::restoreState`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `TextPage::restoreState` function attempts to access `idStack.top()` without ensuring that the stack is not empty, leading to a null pointer dereference when the stack is empty.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of stack operations, specifically not checking for an empty stack before accessing its top element.
*  **Impact:** Program crash due to a segmentation fault.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A crafted PDF file that causes the `TextPage::restoreState` function to be called when the `idStack` is empty.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to generate a malicious PDF file. No special privileges are required.

**2. Heap Buffer Overflow in `TextPage::dump`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `TextPage::dump` function uses `sprintf` to write data into a heap-allocated buffer without sufficient size checking, causing a heap buffer overflow.
*   **Weakness:** Use of `sprintf` without size limits.
*   **Impact:** Heap corruption, which can lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*  **Attack Vector:**  A crafted PDF file that contains text or other data which causes `TextPage::dump` to write more data than the buffer can hold.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to generate a malicious PDF file. No special privileges are required.

**3. Heap Buffer Overflow in `TextPage::addAttributsNode`**

*  **Root Cause:** The `TextPage::addAttributsNode` function uses `sprintf` to write data into a heap-allocated buffer, potentially overflowing the buffer if the size of the formatted string is too large.
*   **Weakness:** Use of `sprintf` without proper size limit checks.
*   **Impact:** Heap corruption, which can lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*  **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted PDF file that leads `TextPage::addAttributsNode` to generate a large string.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker needs to be able to generate a malicious PDF file. No special privileges are required.

**4. Unknown Pointer Dereference in `TextPage::restoreState`**

*   **Root Cause:** A pointer dereference occurs within `TextPage::restoreState`, where the pointer value is unexpected and causes a segmentation fault when attempting to access memory. The root cause might be related to memory corruption or logic errors that happen prior to the crash.
*   **Weakness:** Invalid memory access.
*  **Impact:** Program crash due to a segmentation fault.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A crafted PDF file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to generate a malicious PDF file. No special privileges are required.

**5. Memory Leaks in `TextPage`**

*   **Root Cause:** Memory allocated in several functions (`TextPage::testLinkedText`, `TextPage::dump`, and `TextWord::TextWord`) is not being freed correctly, resulting in memory leaks.
*   **Weakness:** Memory is allocated without a corresponding free operation.
*   **Impact:** Memory exhaustion if the program processes many malicious files.
*   **Attack Vector:** A PDF document that triggers memory allocation within the vulnerable functions without freeing it.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker needs to be able to generate a malicious PDF file. No special privileges are required.

**6. Stack Buffer Overflow in `XRef::getObjectStream`**

*  **Root Cause**:  The vulnerability is triggered within the `XRef::getObjectStream` function. The specific details are not present in the stacktrace however, given the context and the crash location, it is most likely caused by insufficient buffer size while reading object stream.
*  **Weakness**:  Insufficient buffer size allocated on the stack to handle the object stream, which can lead to memory corruption.
*  **Impact**: Program crash due to a segmentation fault.
*  **Attack Vector**: A crafted PDF file that causes the `XRef::getObjectStream` to read more data than the allocated buffer can hold.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to generate a malicious PDF file. No special privileges are required.
