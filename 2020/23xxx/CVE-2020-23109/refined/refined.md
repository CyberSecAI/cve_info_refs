The provided content describes a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the `libheif` library, specifically within the `heif_colorconversion.cc` file at line 2263.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap buffer overflow occurs within the `Op_YCbCr420_to_RRGGBBaa::convert_colorspace` function. This function is responsible for converting color spaces. The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted HEIF image.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking during color space conversion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash due to memory corruption.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overflow data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a malicious HEIF image file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted HEIF image to a user or application that uses the vulnerable `libheif` library.
