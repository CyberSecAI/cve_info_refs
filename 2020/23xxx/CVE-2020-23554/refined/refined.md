Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23554:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-23554

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located within the `FORMATS.dll` plugin of IrfanView, specifically during the processing of DDS files.
- The root cause is a user-mode write access violation when the software attempts to write data to an invalid memory location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **User-mode write access violation:** The program attempts to write data to a memory location that it does not have permission to access, leading to a crash.
- The specific instruction causing the fault is `mov dword ptr [edi+ecx*4-0Ch], eax` at memory address `1003cab0` within the plugin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User-mode write access violation:** This type of vulnerability typically results in a program crash due to the illegal memory access. This constitutes a denial-of-service vulnerability.
- While the provided information doesn't specify other impacts, user-mode write access violations *can* sometimes be leveraged for arbitrary code execution, although this isn't explicitly stated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specifically crafted DDS image file.
- The attacker needs to provide the malicious file to the victim and convince the victim to open the file using the vulnerable IrfanView version.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious DDS file.
- The attacker needs to get the crafted file onto the victim's system, for example by sending via email, or hosting it on a website.
- The attacker relies on the victim opening the file with the vulnerable version of IrfanView.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects IrfanView 32-bit version 4.54.
- The vendor (IrfanView) has fixed the vulnerability in a later plugin version.
- The github page includes the crash information: `FORMATS!GetPlugInInfo+0x7e20: 1003cab0 89448ff4 mov dword ptr [edi+ecx*4-0Ch], eax ds:002b:0af1d000=????????`
