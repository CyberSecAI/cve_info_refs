## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.

* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments.

Olá!

Continuando no assunto de Brute Force, abordarei um dos métodos que podemos utilizar para descobrir os usuários das credenciais de uma aplicação falha na sua segurança, que também serve de base para o CVE-2020-23283. Esta aplicação é real e descontinuada pelo seu desenvolvedor. Os usuários são reais e estão realmente cadastrados na aplicação.

Aproveito para informar que a ação de coletar informações de serviços não é caracterizado crime, uma vez que os serviços estão em um ambiente controlado de testes. Esta matéria tem como fins apresentar os métodos utilizados por hackers para encontrar informações de empresas e apresentar aos desenvolvedores as falhas de segurança que suas aplicações web (portais, sites de atendimento, etc) possuem. Corrigir ou não é uma decisão dos desenvolvedores e gestores/clientes destas aplicações.

*Por Iran Macedo, especialista em proteção de dados e segurança ofensiva / Pentest. 09/05/2020.*

**Quebrar credencial é muito mais do que apenas conhecer uma senha**

A primeira informação que precisamos entender é que uma credencial de acesso, geralmente, é formada por um usuário e por uma senha. Desta forma, se eu entender isso e se eu for um cara cuidadoso, farei com que o meu usuário seja tão difícil de adivinhar quanto a senha que uso nos serviços online.

Lógico que, por muitas vezes, isso é difícil, já que alguns serviços, como o e-mail, precisamos passar para outras pessoas como meio de contato e este tipo de informação se torna pública.

Porém, o mesmo não precisa ser assim em outros serviços, ainda mais nas aplicações privadas de empresas. E este é o caso, onde vamos explorar uma falha da aplicação para encontrar a primeira parte de uma credencial de login: um usuário válido.

Como eu disse na primeira matéria sobre Brute Force, não basta apenas ter várias chaves que encontrei nas mãos se eu não conhecer quais portas estas chaves abrem.

**A aplicação falha**

A aplicação que usarei para demonstrar a coleta de usuários válidos é o mConnect, testado nas versões **02.001.00** e **2013.1.6.8**. Estas versões foram descontinuadas pelo desenvolvedor e não são mais ofertadas aos seus clientes, cujas versões mais novas e livres destas falhas encontram-se disponíveis para atualização e uso.

Entramos em contato com o desenvolvedor VivaceMV (www.mv.com.br) para checar primeiro se as versões encontravam-se desatualizadas para, se não, reportar primeiramente ao desenvolvedor sobre as falhas encontradas.

Foram encontradas falhas severas de tratamento básico, o que torna um enorme risco a disponibilização destas aplicações na internet. Foram levantadas falhas de:

* Leak de dados que expõem os usuários cadastrados através da página de login;
* Leak de outras várias informações gravadas no banco de dados através do código-fonte;
* Falha de SQL Injection através da página de login.

**A falha**

A técnica que vou utilizar para explorar esta aplicação e encontrar usuários válidos se dá pela falha na saída da informação de erro de login, como também pela falta de um controle e bloqueio inteligente de entrada repetidas de dados.

O que isso significa?

Significa que a própria aplicação me diz se um usuário existe ou não. E significa também que eu posso disparar quantos nomes eu quiser, pois nem a aplicação, nem o servidor onde ela está hospedada possuem um controle de tentativas e erros que possam parar este ataque de força bruta.

Vejamos... vou inserir um nome qualquer, que escolhi a esmo: amanda. O que a aplicação me retorna: Senha inválida.

![Não foi fornecido texto alternativo para esta imagem](//:0)

Ok. Eu não digitei senha alguma, somente o nome e enviei o pedido de acesso assim. Usuário: amanda, Senha: nula. O retorno que eu tive da aplicação foi que a senha está errada.

Entendo então que o usuário existe, já que o retorno não foi de usuário inválido. Será?

O que acontece então se eu colocar um outro nome que não exista na aplicação. Que tal o nome: amando. Vejamos...

![Não foi fornecido texto alternativo para esta imagem](//:0)

Agora o retorno que tenho é que o usuário não existe, pois não foi encontrado no banco de dados da aplicação. Veja que a aplicação, que é falha no tratamento das suas informações de saída de erro, me informa gentilmente quais usuários existem no seu banco. Para os que existem, a aplicação informa desconhecer a senha em branco enviada.

**O ataque**

O ataque é simples e bem básico. Primeiro de tudo, preciso de uma grande lista com muitos nomes. Eu posso utilizar o próprio site da empresa e informações da mídia para descobrir nomes dos colaboradores e utilizá-los na exploração da falha. Muitas empresas utilizam nome simples (apenas o nome), outras utilizam nomes compostos (nome e sobrenome) unidos por um ponto ou por um espaço, etc. Desta forma, as possibilidades para se criar uma grande lista de nomes são muitas.

Como eu descobri que esta aplicação trabalha com nomes simples, vou focar somente neste tipo de login, mesmo que ela aceite nomes compostos. E, sim, ela aceita também nomes compostos, pois eu também encontrei estes tipos de usuários nesta mesma aplicação.

Para não ter de escrever um monte de nomes, pesquisei na internet e encontrei uma lista com 20.000 nomes brasileiros, femininos e masculinos, para baixar como arquivo CSV.

![Não foi fornecido texto alternativo para esta imagem](//:0)

Como os nomes vem em uma lista que possui outras informações, é necessário filtrá-la para um arquivo que tenha somente os nomes, ignorando todas as demais informações.

![Não foi fornecido texto alternativo para esta imagem](//:0)

Vamos dar alguns comandos no Bash (cut) para limpar essa sopa de caracteres aí.

![Não foi fornecido texto alternativo para esta imagem](//:0)

Agora sim temos uma lista com 20.000 nomes para utilizar na descoberta de logins.

**A ferramenta de Brute Force**

Tentei gerar um script em Shell para atacar esta aplicação, mas ela trabalha na linguagem ASPX e o Curl não lida bem com este tipo de extensão, pois o Curl apresenta na tela o código binário e não o texto do HTML da página.

Desta forma e para não gastar muito tempo, vou utilizar uma das ferramentas mais utilizadas para exploração de aplicações web no mundo Hacker: o Burp Suite.

Acertando o navegador para utilizar o Burp como Proxy, faço um acesso para verificar o retorno da aplicação.

![Não foi fornecido texto alternativo para esta imagem](//:0)

Agora, pegando a tarefa acima (ID 148), com o botão direito eu a envio para o Intruder do Burp. O Intruder é o cara de Brute Force do Burp Suite.

![Não foi fornecido texto alternativo para esta imagem](//:0)

No Intruder eu configuro todos os itens necessários, começando pelo alvo (endereço da aplicação) e porta de conexão da aplicação.

![Não foi fornecido texto alternativo para esta imagem](//:0)

Na guia 'Positions' nós configuramos os campos que utilizaremos no ataque. O tipo de ataque será o Sniper.

A primeira coisa é clicar no botão 'Clear' para limpar a seleção prévia de todos os campos, selecionar o nome que você utilizou para encontrar um usuário válido e, depois do nome selecionado (no exemplo, amanda), clicar no botão 'Add'. Assim informamos ao Burp que iremos trabalhar somente com este campo, o Username.

![Não foi fornecido texto alternativo para esta imagem](//:0)

Na aba 'Payloads' vamos utilizar o tipo de lista simples (Simple list) e clicando sobre o botão 'Load', vamos selecionar a lista com 20.000 nomes que criamos.

![Não foi fornecido texto alternativo para esta imagem](//:0)

Para facilitar a identificação de nomes válidos de nomes inválidos, precisamos criar um filtro. Isso jogará na tela uma mensagem visual que nos facilitará identificar o que deu certo do que deu errado. Sem isso a verificação final precisaria ser manual. 20.000 tentativas, manualmente, uma a uma.

Para isso vou utilizar a guia 'Options' e clicar sobre o botão 'Add'.

![Não foi fornecido texto alternativo para esta imagem](//:0)

Vou selecionar a informação que eu quero filtrar, que é "Senha inválida". Automaticamente a página se encarregará de completar os dados de limitações de campo de pesquisa para você (:Red;"> e </span>).

![Não foi fornecido texto alternativo para esta imagem](//:0)

E o filtro ficará desta forma. Só precisa tomar cuidado para verificar se estes mesmos limites não existem também em outros pontos do HTML da página.

![Não foi fornecido texto alternativo para esta imagem](//:0)

Após tudo configurado, basta clicar no botão 'Start attack' e aguardar o Burp esgotar todos os 20.000 nomes (!) da lista.

![Não foi fornecido texto alternativo para esta imagem](//:0)

Para organizar a saída, basta clicar no cabeçalho da coluna do filtro que criamos (:Red;">) para separar os usuários encontrados (Senha inválida) dos usuários que não existem no banco de dados da aplicação (Usuário não encontrado).

![Não foi fornecido texto alternativo para esta imagem](//:0)

Ao final, tendo em mãos todos os usuários que existem, basta exportar os resultados, tratar os dados para excluir os usuários inválidos e começar um novo ataque Brute Force, agora testando uma lista de senhas sobre os usuários existentes da aplicação.

Como a aplicação é bem falha no tratamento das informações, é bem capaz dela aceitar senhas fáceis e simples de adivinhar, como '1234' ou 'abcd', etc.

Agora ficou mais fácil seguir com a coleta de senhas válidas, pois vamos economizar esforços ao não disparar milhões de senhas contra usuários que não existem.

**Soluções para esta falha de segurança**

Primeiro de tudo, uma aplicação nunca deve informar ao usuário se o seu login digitado ou se a sua senha digitada estão incorretos. A mensagem, como já estamos habituados a ver em várias outras aplicações web, deve ser genérica e não passar com exatidão o que está errado. Uma mensagem de erro do tipo "Seus dados estão incorretos" ou "Usuário ou senha não confere" já seria o suficiente para que eu não soubesse quais dos dois dados passados estão errados. O nome desta técnica é "Proteção por obscuridade", ou seja, informar desinformando, criando dúvidas. E, convenhamos, é muito mais fácil eu errar uma senha do que um usuário. Portanto, eu ficaria sem saber se o usuário informado realmente existe ou não, pela possibilidade enorme de ter errado a senha.

Segundo, aplicações web devem possuir o mínimo de proteção contra ataques de força bruta. Poderia ser algum mecanismo da própria aplicação, solicitando uma comprovação do usuário de que o mesmo não é um robô através de Captchas, daí passando para métodos de proteção mais avançados, mais confiáveis e mais caros, como bloqueios no firewall do servidor por um IPS ou utilizando um firewall web (Web Application Firewall ou WAF) para uma análise prévia das requisições de logon na aplicação.

Ou seja, as soluções continuam as mesmas e possuem algum custo final ao serem utilizadas. Mas, sem dúvidas, valem o valor a ser pago para proteger os dados.

### Correção da falha

Segundo informações passadas pelo desenvolvedor, o programa mConnect foi descontinuado e não recebe mais atualizações ou suporte. Para continuar a utilizar o serviço, o novo programa, que substituiu o mConnect é o Vivace Connect, disponível para aquisição através de contato com o desenvolvedor.

### **Conclusão**

A sua empresa pode ser severamente afetada por um ataque hacker que só foi possível porque a aplicação utilizada, que você comprou com uma empresa desenvolvedora, não é segura e possui falhas de segurança.

Nem toda falha joga o hacker diretamente dentro da aplicação ou do servidor. Mas pode ser utilizada para que o hacker descubra os dados necessários para entrar nesta aplicação e ter acesso às informações internas da sua empresa.

Desta forma, entendemos que é da responsabilidade do desenvolvedor corrigir estas falhas. Mas, sendo cauteloso, indico que as empresas que utilizam aplicações de terceiros, testem também tais aplicações à procura de falhas, antes de disponibilizar seus acessos e dados privados na internet.

Afinal, quem é que pagará o preço por ter dados acessados, expostos, alterados, sequestrados ou apagados? O cliente que comprou a aplicação ou o desenvolvedor da aplicação?

Olha aí, LGPD! Um sério candidato à multas por vazamento de informações de pacientes. O que a LGPD diz sobre isso?

Isso é papo para ser levado ao juízo, não é mesmo? Afinal, todos têm a sua parcela de culpa.

Abraço!
