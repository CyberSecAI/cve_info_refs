The provided content relates to a bug report in the JerryScript project, which can be used to trigger an assertion failure. However, the provided information does not describe a vulnerability that is exploitable from a security perspective. It appears to be an internal error in the parser when processing invalid syntax.

**Root cause of the issue:**
The root cause is an assertion failure within the `parser_parse_function_arguments` function in `js-parser.c` when encountering invalid JavaScript syntax that includes `//` inside the function name (i.e., `foo//b`). The parser does not correctly handle this invalid syntax, leading to a situation where it attempts to use a non-function scanner info structure as a function scanner info structure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
The weakness is an assertion that triggers upon encountering invalid JavaScript syntax. This is not directly exploitable as a security vulnerability; rather, it is an internal bug that crashes the interpreter when parsing the provided input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of triggering this assertion is that the JerryScript interpreter will crash (Abort with a core dump). This can lead to a denial of service condition. It is not a vulnerability that leads to remote code execution or data access violation.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is by supplying crafted JavaScript that contains invalid syntax, causing the parser to trigger the internal assertion.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to supply crafted JavaScript input to the JerryScript parser. There is no specific requirement for privilege or access other than being able to influence the input that is being parsed.

**Additional details:**

*   The issue was triggered by the following JavaScript snippet:

```javascript
fn_expr = {
"foo//b",
}

(function () {
 var a = [arguments];
})();
```

*   The specific assertion failure occurs in `/home/JerryScript/jerry-core/parser/js/js-parser.c` at line 1705, which corresponds to the `parser_parse_function_arguments` function.

*   The build environment used was Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (Linux 4.15.0-99-generic x86\_64) using the build flags mentioned.

While the content details an internal bug that can crash the application, it doesn't appear to describe a traditional security vulnerability as defined by the CVE description. Therefore, based on the current information, this report is NOT directly related to a security vulnerability, and might not merit CVE assignment.
