- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient input validation when handling the `file` parameter in the `/file/download` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the user-supplied input for the `file` parameter. This allows attackers to manipulate the path and include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. Specifically, the application does not prevent directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access sensitive files on the server. This can lead to information disclosure (e.g., source code, configuration files, credentials) or, in some scenarios, could lead to further compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `/file/download` endpoint by manipulating the `file` parameter in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. They do not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges.
