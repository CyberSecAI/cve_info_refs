Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-23622 (Although the tenable.com content refers to CVE-2020-12695, the github.com content clearly describes an issue that aligns with the description of CVE-2020-23622)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation of the `CALLBACK` parameter within the `SUBSCRIBE` request header of the UPnP protocol implementation in the `cling` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The ability to control the `CALLBACK` header allows an attacker to force the vulnerable device to make requests to arbitrary URLs specified in the `CALLBACK` header, potentially leading to SSRF.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing multiple malicious URLs in the `CALLBACK` header, an attacker can force the vulnerable device to send a large amount of traffic to the specified destinations, causing a reflected amplified TCP DDoS attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive device data by redirecting callbacks to attacker-controlled targets.
- **Intranet Scanning:** Attackers can scan internal networks by forcing the vulnerable device to access resources within the LAN, bypassing DLP measures.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can cause a denial of service by directing large amounts of traffic from the vulnerable devices to specified targets, potentially crashing them.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP `SUBSCRIBE` request with a malicious URL in the `CALLBACK` header to a vulnerable UPnP device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable device. This could be from within the same network or, in some cases, over the internet depending on the network setup and firewall rules.

**Additional Details:**
The `cling` library, which is the vulnerable software mentioned in the github.com content, implements UPnP. The attack vector is via the `SUBSCRIBE` function, which is designed for devices to monitor changes in other devices and services. The vulnerability is triggered when the `CALLBACK` parameter is not checked, and thus, an attacker can control the destination for event notifications. This can lead to the vulnerable device sending data or establishing TCP handshakes with attacker-controlled servers, which enables the SSRF and DDoS capabilities.
