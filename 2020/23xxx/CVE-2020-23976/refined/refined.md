  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and validation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)"

      "SQL Injection": "The vulnerability exists in the `content.php` script, accessible via the `Id` parameter. An attacker can inject SQL code through this parameter.",
       "XSS": "The vulnerability is located in search.php where the tsearch parameter is vulnerable to xss."
    },
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
