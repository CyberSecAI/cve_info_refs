{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input when creating a new block in the Menu Blocks feature, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code which will be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to the attacker gaining control over the user's session, redirecting the user to malicious sites, or performing other malicious actions within the context of the vulnerable website.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious HTML code (specifically using the `ontoggle` event handler within a `<details>` tag) into the 'Name' field of a menu block within the administrative interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have an authenticated account with access to the administrative panel in order to create and modify menu blocks."
