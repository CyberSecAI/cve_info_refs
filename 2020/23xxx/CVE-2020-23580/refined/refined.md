The provided content details a remote code execution vulnerability in PbootCMS v2.0.7.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the PbootCMS message board feature. Specifically, the system fails to prevent the injection of malicious PHP code into the message content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The ability to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:**  The system doesn't properly sanitize or filter user input in the message board, allowing for the injection of executable code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Complete compromise of the server is possible.
*   An attacker could gain full control of the web server and potentially the underlying operating system.
*   Data breaches, malware deployment, or any other malicious activity is achievable.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Message Board Injection:** The attacker injects the malicious code into a message submitted through the PbootCMS message board feature.
*   **Message Display:** The injected code is executed when an administrator views the message in the admin panel, or when the message is displayed on a public facing page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to submit a message to the message board.
*   The attacker does not need admin access initially.
*   The administrator needs to log in and view the message to trigger the execution.
*   The attacker could also trigger the execution if the message is displayed on a public facing page.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Payload:** The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) leverages nested `if` statements (`{pbootpbootpboot:if:if:if...{/pbootpbootpboot:if:if:if}`) and the `assert()` function with concatenated character codes to execute `phpinfo()`.
*   **Specific Code:** The payload `chr(0x70).chr(0x68).chr(0x70).chr(0x69).chr(0x6e).chr(0x66).chr(0x6f).chr(0x28).chr(0x29).chr(0x3b` translates to `phpinfo();`, demonstrating code execution.
*   **Admin Default Credentials:** The issue description notes that the default admin username is "admin" and the default password is "123456" which could be helpful to an attacker, but is not required to trigger the vulnerability.
