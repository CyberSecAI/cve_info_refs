Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-23934

**Vulnerable Software:** RiteCMS 2.2.1

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation and sanitization within the file upload functionality of RiteCMS. This allows an authenticated attacker to upload a malicious PHP file containing arbitrary code, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows uploading of arbitrary file types, including PHP files, without proper validation.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the filename, allowing for predictable paths to the uploaded shell.
*   **Direct Execution of Uploaded Files:** Uploaded PHP files can be accessed and executed directly through the webserver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to:
*   Complete compromise of the server.
*   Data breaches.
*   Malware deployment.
*   Denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessed via the web interface of the RiteCMS application.
*   **File Upload:** The attacker uses the file upload feature within the "Filemanager" module to upload a malicious PHP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid login credentials to access the RiteCMS administration panel. The default credentials "admin:admin" are mentioned.
*   **Web Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable RiteCMS application.
*   **Ability to upload files:** The attacker must be able to interact with the file manager in the RiteCMS administration panel to upload a file.
