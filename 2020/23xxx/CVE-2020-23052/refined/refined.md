RELATED: CVE-2020-23052

The advisory describes a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Mahara v19.10.2 CMS.

Vulnerability Details:
- Vulnerability: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Location: `Ficheros` module, specifically in the `groupfiles.php` file.
- Affected parameters: `nombre` and `descripción` parameters related to the "Crear Carpeta" (Create Folder) functionality.
- Attack Vector: Remote attackers with low privileges can inject malicious script code as files and folder names.
- Injection Method: POST request.
- User Interaction: Low.
- Authentication Required: Restricted Authentication (Guest Privileges)

Impact:
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Persistent phishing attacks
  - Persistent external redirects to malicious sources
  - Persistent manipulation of affected application modules.
- The injected code can attack both the frontend and backend of the web application.
- Higher privileged accounts reviewing files in the backend are also at risk.

Technical Details:
- The vulnerability exists because the application does not properly validate user input in the `nombre` and `descripción` parameters when creating folders.
- Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into these fields.
- The injected code is then stored persistently and executed when other users (including administrators) view the affected folder or file.

Proof of Concept:
1. Log in as a regular user.
2. Navigate to the mygroup management section.
3. Open the "ficheros" (files) tab.
4. Inject the payload `<iframe src=evil.source onload=alert(document.cookie)></iframe>` into the "Nombre" (name) and "Descripción" (description) input fields when creating a folder ("Crear Carpeta").
5. The XSS will trigger when the folder is viewed, edited, or deleted.
6. Higher privileged users reviewing the files in the backend will also trigger the XSS.
