The provided content is related to CVE-2020-23310.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is triggered by an invalid function declaration within the JerryScript parser. Specifically, the issue arises from an assertion failure in the `parser_parse_function_statement` function within `js-parser-statm.c`, where the `next_scanner_info_p->type` is not `SCANNER_TYPE_FUNCTION` as expected. This indicates a parsing error when encountering a malformed function definition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The weakness is an assertion failure caused by a malformed function definition, leading to program termination (abort). The core issue lies in the parser's inability to handle or recover gracefully from such input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The exploitation leads to an "ICE: Assertion" failure, which results in the program aborting (core dumped). This effectively constitutes a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability, as it can crash the application or interpreter if an attacker can control the input given to the parser.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted JavaScript code that includes a malformed function definition, like the given `function a") {` example. 

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to provide JavaScript code to be parsed by the vulnerable JerryScript interpreter. This could be through a web application, a script engine, or any other means where JerryScript is used to parse user-provided or external code.
