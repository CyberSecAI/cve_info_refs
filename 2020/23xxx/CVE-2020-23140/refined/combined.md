|  | Product: Microweber |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | Product Version: 1.1.18 |
|  |  |
|  | Vulnerability: Insufficient Session Expiration |
|  | Description: |
|  | Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization |
|  |  |
|  | Attack Type: Local |
|  |  |
|  | Impact: |
|  | The lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. |
|  | For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. |
|  | Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. |
|  | In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). |
|  | Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim. |
|  |  |
