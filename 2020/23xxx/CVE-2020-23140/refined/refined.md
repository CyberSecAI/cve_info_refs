{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient session expiration allows attackers to reuse old session credentials or IDs for authorization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient session expiration. The application does not properly invalidate sessions after a user logs out or when a session should expire, allowing for potential session reuse.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can reuse intercepted session IDs, potentially obtained through network sniffing or XSS attacks. This could lead to unauthorized access to the user's account. In shared computer scenarios, the browser's back button can be used to access previously viewed pages.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local attacks, network sniffing, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to intercept or obtain a valid session ID, either through network access or exploiting a vulnerability such as XSS. In shared computer environments, no special capabilities are needed beyond being a subsequent user."
