The provided content relates to CVE-2020-23966.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of input filtering for POST parameters in the `post.php` file. These parameters are directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `post.php` file. The code directly uses user-supplied input from POST parameters in database queries without proper sanitization or use of parameterized queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can lead to:
- Data breaches, by accessing sensitive information stored in the database.
- Data manipulation, by modifying or deleting data.
- Potential compromise of the entire application or server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is via HTTP POST requests to the `post.php` file. By manipulating the 'post' parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No specific privileges or access is needed other than being able to make web requests to the `post.php` file.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `post.php` file.
- The POST parameter is directly used in a SQL query.
- The Proof of Concept (POC) uses `post=1 and sleep(2) --` to demonstrate the SQL injection vulnerability. The `sleep(2)` function is used to cause a delay, which is an indicator that the injection is successful.
- The provided fix involves using prepared statements with parameterized queries, which prevents SQL injection by separating SQL code from data.
