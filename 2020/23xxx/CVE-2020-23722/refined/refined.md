The provided content describes a vulnerability in FUEL-CMS where a regular user can modify the administrator's password.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authorization checks when updating user account information. Specifically, the application does not verify if the user attempting to update account information has the necessary privileges to modify the administrator account.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability occurs because a regular user can manipulate the `id` and `fuel_id` parameters in the HTTP request to target the administrator's account (ID 1). The application does not validate if the user is authorized to modify the account associated with the provided ID.
- **Insufficient Authorization:** The system lacks proper authorization checks to verify the user's privilege before allowing modifications to other accounts. Any authenticated user is able to send requests to modify other accounts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can change the administrator's password, thereby gaining full control of the FUEL-CMS instance. This allows the attacker to potentially compromise the whole system and data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface. An authenticated non-admin user can modify their own user information through the web interface. Then intercept the HTTP request, modify the `id` and `fuel_id` parameters to target the administrator account, and submit the modified request to change the administrator password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account with the FUEL-CMS application, meaning they have to be able to log in with an account that is not an administrator account.
- The attacker must be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests. This can be done using tools like Burp Suite or similar web proxies.
