Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-23989:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization of the "oid" parameter in the "pwsec.php" page of the NeDi application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application directly reflects user-supplied input from the "oid" parameter within the HTML output of the "pwsec.php" page without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser when they access a crafted URL.
- This allows an attacker to perform actions such as:
    - Stealing session cookies, potentially leading to account compromise
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacing web pages
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL. An attacker would need to construct a malicious URL containing an XSS payload within the "oid" parameter.
- The user then needs to click this malicious URL, or have it embedded in a page they visit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL with the malicious payload.
- The attacker needs a way to deliver this URL to the victim, for example through phishing emails, or by embedding it into another page.
- The attacker doesn't need prior access to the application, and can exploit this from an external position.
