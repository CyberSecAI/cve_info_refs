The provided content relates to CVE-2020-23915.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `peg::resolve_escape_sequence` function in `peglib.h`. The issue arises when processing escape sequences within the parser. Specifically, an invalid UTF-8 character can cause `codepoint_length` to return an incorrect length and cause a heap overflow in `resolve_escape_sequence`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The `resolve_escape_sequence` function attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer due to incorrect length calculation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a crash or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution, though the provided information focuses on the crash aspect.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted input that contains invalid UTF-8 characters within escape sequences, which will be parsed by the peglib library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input that is parsed by the vulnerable function. This could be from a file, network socket or other input source.

The fix for this vulnerability is included in commit `b3b29ce8f3acf3a32733d930105a17d7b0ba347e`. The fix involves modifying the `codepoint_length` function in `peglib.h` to ensure the length calculation does not proceed when the buffer length is insufficient for UTF-8 character processing. Additionally, a test case was added in `test/test1.cc` to cover this scenario.
