The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Import Mail" feature of phpList version 3.5.5.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when importing emails via file upload. Specifically, it attempts to remove script tags, which is insufficient to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS vulnerability in the "Import Mail" feature, specifically when importing via file upload. The vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization of user-provided data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as: transmitting private data (cookies or session information) to the attacker, redirecting the victim to malicious websites, or performing other actions on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by importing a file with emails containing malicious JavaScript code within an SVG tag.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the admin panel of phpList. They need to navigate to the "Import Mail" section and upload a specially crafted file containing the malicious payload.
