Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-23558:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a user-mode write access violation within the IrfanView software. Specifically, this occurs during the processing of a crafted DCR file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- User-mode write access violation. This means the application is attempting to write to a memory location that it doesn't have permission to modify, leading to instability and potentially exploitable conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The immediate impact is a user-mode write access violation, which can cause the application to crash. While the description notes that it's a "user-mode write access violation", exploitation could potentially lead to more severe outcomes, such as arbitrary code execution, depending on the specific memory corruption scenario.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DCR file that, when opened with the vulnerable IrfanView, will trigger the write access violation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to get the target to open a crafted .DCR file using the vulnerable version of IrfanView. This could be achieved through various social engineering techniques (e.g., emailing the file, including it on a website, etc.).

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs in the `FORMATS.dll` plugin, specifically at the address `FORMATS!ShowPlugInSaveOptions_W+0x0000000000007f4b`.
- The instruction causing the write access violation is `mov word ptr [edi+eax*2],cx`.
- The write is attempted to the address `ds:002b:1bc44e40`.
- The `Formats.dll` version is 4.55.4.
- The affected IrfanView version is 4.54 (32-bit).
