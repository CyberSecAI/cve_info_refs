```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of the requested URI, allowing directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory Traversal"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can access arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure, such as the /etc/passwd file.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a GET request with directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../../) and a null byte (%00) to bypass sanitization.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Kyocera Printer. No authentication is required."
