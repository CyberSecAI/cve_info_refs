Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-23935:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the authentication mechanism of the Student Management System. Specifically, the application is not properly sanitizing user inputs before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of an SQL injection vulnerability, allowing an attacker to manipulate SQL queries through user-supplied inputs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass the authentication process and gain unauthorized access to the admin panel of the application. This can lead to complete control of the system, including data manipulation, deletion, and addition, as well as potentially pivoting to other systems/accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Login Form:** The attack vector is the login form of the admin panel.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a POST request to the `process.php` file with specially crafted username parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the vulnerable application over the network.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to craft a HTTP POST request with the specific parameters.
- **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker requires a minimal knowledge about SQL to craft the proper bypass payload.

**Technical details:**
- The attacker can log in by providing username `admin'#` and any password value. The single quote breaks the SQL query and the `#` comment out the rest of the query allowing the bypass.
- The vulnerability was tested on Windows & WampServer

The vulnerability allows bypassing authentication due to a SQL injection. An attacker can log in as admin without knowing the correct password by injecting `admin'#` as username.
