Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23546:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is located within the `FORMATS.dll` plugin when processing a crafted XBM file. The issue arises because data from a faulting address is used as an argument in a subsequent function call, specifically at `FORMATS!ReadMosaic+0x0000000000000981`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Usage of potentially invalid memory address for function arguments.
- Insufficient input validation or sanitization when parsing XBM files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. However, the description also states "or possibly other unspecified impacts" which suggests the potential for more severe consequences depending on how the faulting address is used.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to have the crafted XBM file and to be able to open it with IrfanView on the target machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious XBM file.
- The attacker needs to induce the user to open the crafted XBM file using the vulnerable version of IrfanView.
- No special privileges or network access is required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in IrfanView 32-bit version 4.54, specifically in the `FORMATS.dll` plugin.
- The vulnerability has been fixed by the vendor in a later plugin version, as mentioned in the provided content.
- The specific faulting instruction is `FORMATS!ReadMosaic+0x981: 10003171 8a91e8110d10 mov dl,byte ptr FORMATS!GetPlugInInfo+0x9b0b8 ds:002b:dcd9deb4=??`
