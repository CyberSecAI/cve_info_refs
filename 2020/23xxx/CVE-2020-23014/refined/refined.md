Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23014:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to a lack of input sanitization in the `/apiui/command_help` endpoint of the APfell/Mythic framework. User-supplied input passed through the `_` parameter in the URL is not filtered and is directly used in the `payloadtypes_callback` function. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects user-supplied input without proper sanitization, which allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Session hijacking:** An attacker can steal the session of an authenticated user.
- **Privilege escalation:** By adding new users to the administration panel, an attacker could escalate their privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript payload within the `_` parameter of a GET request to `/apiui/command_help`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to lure an authenticated user to click on the crafted link containing the malicious payload. The user must have an active session on the APfell/Mythic platform.
