Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23550:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `FORMATS.dll` plugin of IrfanView when processing a crafted DDS file. Specifically, a user-mode write access violation occurs within the `GetPlugInInfo` function at offset `0x7e82`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- User-mode write access violation: The program attempts to write to a memory location that it does not have permission to write to, leading to a crash or potentially other undefined behavior.
- Improper handling of crafted DDS file: The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed or specially crafted DDS file, indicating a lack of sufficient input validation and error handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a user-mode write access violation, leading to a program crash and denial of service.
- It's possible, though not explicitly stated, that this vulnerability could be exploited further for other unintended consequences if the attacker could control the write address and data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a local attack. The user must open a crafted DDS file using IrfanView.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or obtain a specially crafted DDS file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open this crafted DDS file with IrfanView.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in IrfanView 32-bit version 4.54.
- The vulnerable code is located within the `FORMATS.dll` plugin.
- The specific memory access violation occurs when writing a byte at the memory address pointed to by the `edi` register.
- The vendor has released a fix for this issue in updated plugins.
