- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly validate user-supplied file paths before using them in the `unlink` function. Specifically, the `unlink` function is called on the user-provided `$_GET['file']` without any checks to ensure that the file is within the intended backup directory or that it exists.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The primary vulnerability is arbitrary file deletion, where an attacker can delete any file on the server that the webserver user has permission to access.
    - **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application lacks proper input validation and sanitization for file paths, allowing the attacker to specify an absolute path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to data loss, system instability, or complete service disruption.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker needs to be logged in with administrator privileges to access the backup page and trigger the file deletion.
    - The attack is performed through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `backup-start.html.php` script, where the `file` parameter contains the path to the file to be deleted.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must have administrator-level access to the application.
    - The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
