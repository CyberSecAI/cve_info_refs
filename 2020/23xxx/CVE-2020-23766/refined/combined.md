## Description

![@whiskey-jj](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40733224?u=9c096a728449b02babfbfa34c2a3d984cd87fbfd&v=4&size=48)[whiskey-jj](https://github.com/whiskey-jj)opened [on Jul 2, 2020](https://github.com/danpros/htmly/issues/412#issue-650205621)

**Vulnerability description**

Arbitrary file deletion vulnerability was found in v2.7.5.Hackers need administrator rights and they can use any absolute directory to delete any file in the server.

**Steps to reproduce the problem**

Using GitHub source code to build the local environment.

PHP7.3 Apache2.4 Windows10

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40733224/86409232-024a9480-bceb-11ea-86d7-8e5c8a0a432a.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40733224/86409232-024a9480-bceb-11ea-86d7-8e5c8a0a432a.png)

Enter the backup page.Create a backup and delete it. At the same time, use burpsuite to capture the package.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40733224/86408626-ea264580-bce9-11ea-994e-b106b03e09f3.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40733224/86408626-ea264580-bce9-11ea-994e-b106b03e09f3.png)

Enter the absolute path of the file you want to delete here.

The relative path is OK

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40733224/86408399-84d25480-bce9-11ea-906d-17be49ed7bfe.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40733224/86408399-84d25480-bce9-11ea-906d-17be49ed7bfe.png)

The file has been deleted.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40733224/86408425-91ef4380-bce9-11ea-883f-17ad7837b33d.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40733224/86408425-91ef4380-bce9-11ea-883f-17ad7837b33d.png)

I think there's something wrong with the code here.

\system\admin\views\backup-start.html.php

```
<?php
if (login()) {
    if (isset($_GET['file'])) {
        $file = _h($_GET['file']);

        if (!empty($file)) {
            unlink($file);
        }

    }
}
?>

```

It does not control the path entered by the user, nor does it detect whether the file belongs to backup
