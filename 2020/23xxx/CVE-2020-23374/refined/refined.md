- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the usage of Editor.md, which contains an XSS vulnerability. This vulnerable component is used by noneCMS in the `admin/article/add.html` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote authenticated attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This can lead to various impacts, including but not limited to, cookie stealing, session hijacking, defacement, and malicious redirects when another user visits the page.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves injecting malicious script into the `name` parameter when adding/editing an article.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the right to edit articles within the noneCMS system.
