The provided content details a vulnerability in Phpgurukul User Registration & User Management System v2.0, which is relevant to the provided CVE ID.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the `firstname` and `lastname` parameters during user registration and profile updates. This allows attackers to inject malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts injected through the `firstname` and `lastname` fields are stored in the database and executed when the data is displayed in the admin panel (`manage-users.php` and `update-profile.php`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session hijacking
- Persistent phishing attacks
- Persistent external redirects to malicious sources
- Persistent manipulation of affected application modules
- Cookie theft

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the registration form or user edit module. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the `firstname` (`fname`) and `lastname` (`lname`) parameters via a POST request.
- The injected script is then executed when an administrator views the user list (`manage-users.php`) or user profile (`update-profile.php`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication and can exploit the vulnerability with anonymous privileges.
- User interaction is low, as the attacker only needs to register or update a profile with malicious script. The execution occurs when an admin accesses the affected pages.
