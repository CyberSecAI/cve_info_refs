Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23868:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the "d" parameter of the `inc/rt-popup.php` page within the NeDi 1.9C application. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. User-supplied input is directly included in the HTML output without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the crafted URL.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Successful XSS exploitation could allow an attacker to steal session cookies, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could potentially deface the webpage.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker could inject malicious scripts that redirect users to a phishing page.
*   **Other malicious activities:** JavaScript execution may allow the attacker to conduct other malicious activities against the user within the context of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The attack vector is through crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `d` parameter and then tricking a victim into clicking the link. This URL could be delivered through various methods such as email, chat, or other websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Target Application:** The attacker needs to know that the vulnerable `inc/rt-popup.php` page and its vulnerable parameter exist in NeDi 1.9C.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL with the XSS payload injected into the vulnerable parameter.
*   **Ability to Distribute the Malicious URL:** The attacker needs a way to get a user to click the crafted URL to trigger the exploit. This could involve social engineering.

**Additional Details**

*   The provided text gives specific instructions on how to reproduce the vulnerability, including a sample XSS payload.
*   The text also includes a clear statement of the vulnerability: "NeDi 1.9C allows Cross-Site Scripting via "d" parameter at "inc/rt-popup.ph" page".
*   The vulnerable URL is `https://<nedi_server_ip>/inc/rt-popup.php?d=<img src=1 onerror=alert(document.domain)>`

In summary, the content accurately describes a Reflected XSS vulnerability in NeDi 1.9C, detailing the vulnerable parameter, the attack vector, impact, and steps to reproduce it.
