Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to potential vulnerabilities in WildBit Viewer:

**Vulnerability Overview**

The provided GitHub document details multiple crash reports of WildBit Viewer's `Editor.exe` when processing TIFF files. These crashes are categorized as "User Mode Write AV" or "Access Violation", specifically due to attempts to write to invalid memory locations, or read from invalid addresses. The crashes occur at various code locations within the `Editor.exe` module, including:

*   `Editor!TMethodImplementationIntercept+0x68f6c2`
*   `Editor!TMethodImplementationIntercept+0x3c3682`
*   `Editor+0x5cd7`
*   `Editor+0x576b`
*   `Editor+0x76af`
*   `ntdll!RtlpCoalesceFreeBlocks+0x268`

**Root Cause of Vulnerability**

The root cause appears to be related to improper handling of data within TIFF files by the `Editor.exe` module of WildBit Viewer. Specifically:

*   **Memory Corruption**: The crashes consistently point to write access violations (e.g., `mov dword ptr [ecx+ebx*8],eax`, `mov word ptr [ebx],cx`, `mov dword ptr [edx],edi`, `mov dword ptr [ecx],edx`, `fistp qword ptr [ecx+edx]`). This indicates that the program is attempting to write data to memory locations that it does not own or are invalid.
*   **Heap Corruption**: At least one crash occurs in `ntdll!RtlpCoalesceFreeBlocks+0x268` with the description "Data from Faulting Address controls Branch Selection", which suggests a memory corruption related to heap management.
*   **Out-of-Bounds Write**: The instruction `mov dword ptr [ecx+ebx*8],eax` suggests an out-of-bounds write is occurring.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Buffer Overflow/Out-of-Bounds Write:** The repeated "Write AV" crashes indicate a vulnerability where the program writes data past the allocated memory buffer. This suggests a lack of bounds checking when handling data from TIFF files.
*   **Heap Corruption:** The crash in `ntdll!RtlpCoalesceFreeBlocks` implies potential issues with dynamic memory allocation/deallocation, leading to heap corruption.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The software appears to be parsing TIFF files without sufficient validation of the data, leading to invalid memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is that specially crafted TIFF files can crash the application, leading to a denial of service condition.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The "EXPLOITABLE" classification in the crash analysis suggests a more severe risk. A skilled attacker could potentially craft a malicious TIFF file to overwrite critical memory locations, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, allowing for complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors**

*   **Malicious TIFF File:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker crafting a malicious TIFF file designed to trigger one of the identified crash conditions. This file could be delivered via:
    *   Email attachment
    *   Website download
    *   Other file transfer methods
*   **User Interaction**: The user would have to open the malicious TIFF file with WildBit Viewer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Technical Skill:** An attacker would need technical skills to craft malicious TIFF files that trigger the memory corruption issues.
*   **File Delivery:** The attacker would need the capability to deliver the malicious TIFF file to the victim's machine.
*   **User Action:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening the malicious TIFF file using WildBit Viewer.

**Additional Notes**
* The crashes were found using the !exploitable debugger extension. This tool helps to determine if a crash is exploitable.
* Multiple crashes at different locations with the same root cause points towards a common vulnerability present in the way WildBit Viewer handles TIFF file.

**CVE Relevance**

While the provided information does not mention a specific CVE, the detailed analysis of multiple "Write AV" crashes in `Editor.exe` when processing TIFF files strongly suggests the presence of a vulnerability that would be assigned a CVE. It is possible that CVE-2020-23891 could relate to this.

The provided content has more detail than the official CVE description, especially with the crash locations and stack traces that point to a more specific attack vector.
