The provided content describes a vulnerability in Navigate CMS 2.9, specifically a blind SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `category` GET parameter, which is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by injecting malicious code into the `category` parameter.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application fails to sanitize the user-supplied `category` parameter before using it in a database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker can potentially read, update, or delete arbitrary data from the database.
- Remote Code Execution: Depending on the database backend, database connection settings, and the underlying operating system, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attack vector is through a specially crafted GET request to the `navigate.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable `category` parameter.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability

**Additional Information**

The provided content gives specific details on how to trigger the blind SQL injection by injecting SQL commands into the `category` parameter. The provided examples use `sleep()` to demonstrate the blind nature of the SQLi. This is a common technique that allows attackers to determine if a SQL injection is possible without directly viewing the SQL query results. The impact could include arbitrary data access and potentially remote code execution, depending on the server environment.
