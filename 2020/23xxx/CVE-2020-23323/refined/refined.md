The provided content relates to CVE-2020-23323.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `re_parse_char_escape` function of the JerryScript engine, specifically when parsing a regular expression containing an invalid unicode escape sequence.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists due to improper parsing of invalid unicode escape sequences within regular expressions. This leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by triggering a heap-buffer-overflow in the JerryScript engine by crafting a malicious regular expression. It could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution depending on the capabilities of the attacker and the vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted regular expression as input to the `RegExp` constructor. In the provided example, the specific crafted regex is `"\\u"`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be able to provide or influence the input to the JerryScript engine which will then process the malicious regular expression, leading to exploitation.
