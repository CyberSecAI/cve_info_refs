Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-23522

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Pixelimity CMS is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks due to a lack of proper protection against forged requests. Specifically, the password change functionality in the `setting.php` page is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: The application doesn't properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- Lack of CSRF protection: The application does not use anti-CSRF tokens or other mechanisms to prevent CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Account takeover: An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to change their password, effectively locking them out and taking control of their account.
- Malicious actions: Through the forged requests, an attacker could potentially manipulate other settings or execute administrative functions.
- Injection of HTML or Scripts: The vulnerability allows malicious users to inject HTML or scripts via the forged requests.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page or script that contains a crafted request to the vulnerable `setting.php` page.
- The attacker uses social engineering to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious page or interacting with the crafted script, which triggers the forged request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator of the Pixelimity CMS into accessing a malicious page controlled by the attacker.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the CMS server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter identified is `password`
- The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates how an attacker can change the administrator's password using Burp Suite to intercept and manipulate the request.
- The provided links show the steps to reproduce the attack by changing the administrator password.
