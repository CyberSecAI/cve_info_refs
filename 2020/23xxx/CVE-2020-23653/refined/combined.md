## Description

Hi, this is Tencent **Xcheck** team. Our code safety check tool Xcheck has found several unserialize vulnerabilities in this project（v4, v5, v6）. It leads to remote code execution. Here are the details.

**v6**

1. app/admin/controller/api/Update.php

   line: 46 `$this->rules = unserialize($this->request->post('rules', 'a:0:{}', ''));`

   line: 47 `$this->ignore = unserialize($this->request->post('ignore', 'a:0:{}', ''));`

**v6 v5 v4**

2. app/wechat/controller/api/Push.php

line: 102 `$this->receive = $this->toLower(unserialize($this->request->post('receive', '', null)));`

Prevent from abusing of this vulnerability, we don't provide proof of concept. We hope to repair it as soon as possible.

**From Xcheck Team**
