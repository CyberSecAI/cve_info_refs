**CVE Relevance:**

The provided content about the SQL injection vulnerability is **UNRELATED** to the specified CVE ID, CVE-2020-23978. The content describes a SQL injection in a different product.

**Vulnerability Details (Extracted from the second content):**

*   **Root Cause:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization in the `id` parameter of the `offerta.php` page.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via a GET request parameter. Specifically, the `id` parameter in `offerta.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Database compromise: An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and passwords (as seen in the example of dumping the "utenti" table).
    *   Potential for complete application takeover: By exploiting the SQL injection, the attacker could potentially modify the database, create administrative accounts, or execute malicious code on the server, leading to complete control of the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
    *   **HTTP GET parameter:** The attack vector is the `id` parameter in a GET request to `/offerta.php`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
    *   No prior authentication is required, it appears to be an unauthenticated attack vector.
    *   The attacker should possess basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
    *   The attacker could use automated tools, such as SQLMap, to exploit the vulnerability, as demonstrated in the provided example.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id` parameter in `offerta.php`
    *   **SQL Injection Type:**  GET-based SQL injection
    *   **Exploit Tool:** SQLMap is used to demonstrate the exploitation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content provides a Google Dork to find vulnerable instances.
*   The content shows a step-by-step process of how an attacker can use SQLMap to exploit the vulnerability, including finding the database name, tables, and dumping user data.
*   The content specifies the vulnerable version as "v1" of "Soluzione Globale Ecommerce CMS".
