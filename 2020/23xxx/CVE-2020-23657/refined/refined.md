The content is related to CVE-2020-23657.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript code. Specifically, the application does not properly HTML entity encode user-provided data that is reflected back to the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Input is not properly sanitized when creating new records within the "Configuration" module.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can be used to:
* Transmit private data, such as cookies and session information, to the attacker.
* Redirect the victim to malicious websites controlled by the attacker.
* Perform malicious actions on the userâ€™s machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.

**Attack vectors:** An authenticated user can inject a malicious payload into the "Configuration" module, which is then stored in the database and executed when other users visit the page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the NavigateCMS application.
* The attacker must have the ability to create/modify configurations in the specified modules.
