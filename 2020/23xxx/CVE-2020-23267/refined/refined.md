The provided content is related to CVE-2020-23267.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-based buffer overflow occurs due to incorrect pointer arithmetic within a loop in the `gf_hinter_track_process()` function. The `ptr` variable is incremented without properly checking if it remains within the bounds of allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow: The code reads beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.
- Incorrect pointer arithmetic: The logic for incrementing the `ptr` variable and reading data is flawed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The buffer overflow can lead to application crashes.
- Potential information exposure: By overflowing the heap, an attacker could overwrite critical data and potentially expose sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- A crafted media file. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered when a malicious file is processed with the `MP4Box` tool using the `-hint` option.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious media file to a vulnerable application, or trick the application into processing such a file.
- The attacker doesn't need any specific position or special privileges.
