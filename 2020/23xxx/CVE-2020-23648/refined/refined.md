Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-23648:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The ASUS RT-N12E router has an incorrect access control vulnerability in the `system.asp/start_apply.htm` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authentication:** The `start_apply.htm` page allows modification of the administrator password without requiring any prior authentication. This bypasses the expected login mechanism.
*   **Insecure Password Reset:** The password change is achieved by sending a specifically crafted POST request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can change the administrator password, effectively gaining complete control of the router.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality and Integrity:** With admin access, an attacker can change any setting, monitor network activity, potentially redirect traffic, and perform further malicious actions.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker can also potentially disrupt the functionality of the router causing a denial-of-service for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/start_apply.htm` page. This request contains the new admin password in the `newpass` and `confpass` parameters, along with other parameters that are expected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the ASUS RT-N12E router or have network access to it. This could be a user within the local network, or potentially an attacker with access through other means such as a compromised machine.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need to know the current administrator password to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details**
* The vulnerability is triggered by sending the following POST data to `http://router/start_apply.htm`:
```
current_page=system.asp&typeForm=formSystemSetup&submit-url=%2Fsystem.asp&action_mode=Restart_MISC&flag=nodetect&preferred_lang=BR&NTP_SYSTIMEZONE=GMT%2B02%3A00&newpass=NEWPASSWORD&confpass=NEWPASSWORD&logServer=&timeZone=-2+7&ntpServerIp=pool.ntp.org
```
    * `newpass=NEWPASSWORD` : Sets the new password.
    * `confpass=NEWPASSWORD` : Confirms the new password.
    * other parameters like `current_page` and `action_mode` seems required by the router.
