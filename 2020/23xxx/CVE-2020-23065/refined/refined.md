- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an XSS flaw present in older versions of VideoJS, specifically within the Flash-based video player. This vulnerable version of VideoJS was bundled within the DemoBundle and the ezdemo legacy extension.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to various impacts such as session hijacking, defacement, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves leveraging the vulnerable Flash-based video player within VideoJS. The vulnerability is triggered when a user interacts with the video player, executing the injected malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to find a way to inject malicious code into the video player. This could be achieved via manipulating parameters of the video player. They would also require knowledge of the system's configuration.
