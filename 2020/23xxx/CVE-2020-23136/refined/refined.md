Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Microweber application, specifically version 1.1.18, fails to properly invalidate or expire user sessions after a user logs out.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Session Expiration:** The core issue is that the session remains active even after the user has logged out. This leaves the user vulnerable to session hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** If an attacker gains access to a user's session (e.g., by stealing the session cookie), they can maintain access even after the legitimate user logs out, potentially leading to account compromise.
- **Lack of Revocation:** The victim cannot revoke access from the attacker once the account has been compromised, as the session remains active regardless of logout.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The provided text indicates that the attack type is local, suggesting the attacker might need local access to the user's machine or network to steal session data, such as cookies. However, this does not exclude the possibility of remote exploitation, for example, through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Session Hijacking:**  The attacker needs to steal or obtain a valid session identifier (e.g., a cookie) to exploit the vulnerability. This could be done through various techniques such as man-in-the-middle attacks or malware on the user's system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to acquire a valid session identifier, potentially requiring access to the user's local machine or network traffic.
- The attacker doesn't necessarily need to be logged into the application itself; they only need the session information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content clearly states that the Microweber version affected is 1.1.18.
- The content references OWASP guidelines on session management.
