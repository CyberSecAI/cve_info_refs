Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-23162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the weak encryption and sensitive information disclosure within the Pyrescom Termod4 time management devices. Specifically, the device stores session data in a way that allows attackers to recover plaintext user credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Weak Encryption:** The method used to protect session data is not robust, allowing for easy decryption.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The session file contains sensitive user credentials, which are exposed due to the inadequate encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers can obtain plaintext user credentials, potentially granting them access to the device's web interface and other functionalities.
*   **Chained Exploitation:** This vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-23161, CVE-2020-23160) to achieve full system compromise, including remote code execution as root.
*   **Data Breach:** Compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data handled by the time management system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the web interface of the Pyrescom Termod4 device.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable Pyrescom Termod4 device.
*   **No Authentication Required Initially:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability without prior authentication, leveraging the LFI vulnerability (CVE-2020-23161) to access the session file.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Pyrescom Termod4 time management devices before version 10.04k.
*   The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code developed by Outpost24 demonstrates how to exploit the chained vulnerabilities. This PoC can decrypt exposed session data to get plaintext credentials.

In summary, CVE-2020-23162 allows an attacker to obtain sensitive user credentials from a poorly encrypted session file. This, when chained with other vulnerabilities, can lead to complete compromise of the Pyrescom Termod4 devices.
