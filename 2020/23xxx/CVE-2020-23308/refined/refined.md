The provided content describes a bug report for JerryScript, an ultra-lightweight JavaScript engine, and includes details about an assertion failure.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is an assertion failure in the `parser_parse_expression` function within `js-parser-expr.c`. This assertion `context_p->stack_top_uint8 == LEXER_EXPRESSION_START` fails during the parsing of a specific JavaScript code snippet. This implies an error in the parser's internal state management during expression parsing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness is an internal parsing error that triggers an assertion failure, leading to a crash. The parser's stack is not in the expected state when parsing the specific code snippet `typeof (global.v2) = 123;` causing an internal assertion to fail.

**Impact of exploitation:** The impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) through a crash of the JerryScript engine. When the faulty JavaScript code is processed, the program terminates abruptly with an error and a core dump.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is providing a crafted JavaScript code snippet that exposes the parsing error. Specifically, the code snippet `typeof (global.v2) = 123;` triggers the issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to supply crafted JavaScript code to be parsed by the vulnerable JerryScript engine. This might be possible through web pages, scripts, or other methods where the engine is used.
