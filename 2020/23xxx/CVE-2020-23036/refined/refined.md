- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure session validation due to plain-text transmission of the password parameter in HTTP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  Plain-text transmission of authentication credentials (password) over HTTP.
    -  Lack of SSL/TLS encryption for the web server.
    -  No protection against brute-force attacks on the PIN (4-6 digits).
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    -  Compromise of the mobile Wi-Fi application file system.
    -  Information leaks.
- **Attack vectors:**
    -  Remote attackers with network access privileges, including those on public Wi-Fi networks.
    - Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks to intercept the plain-text password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Network access to the same network as the vulnerable device.
    - Ability to capture HTTP traffic between the application and server (e.g., using a packet sniffer).
    - No prior authentication is required.
