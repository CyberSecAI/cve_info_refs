Hi Team phplist3, I found a small bug!

\*\*Describe the bug

An authenticated malicious user can take advantage of a Stored XSS vulnerability in the "IMPORT EMAILS" feature. It affects both options SEND A CAMPAIGN feature.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Login into the panel phplist
2. Go to 'phplist3/lists/admin/?page=setup&tk=1c63b88932115188325586eab8221123'
3. Chose 'Config' -> Click 'Add some subscribers' -> Chose 1/3 options (Copy and paste list of emails) -> 'Add a list'
4. Insert Payload XSS:

5. Save
6. xss alert message

**Also Video PoC**

<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lm42PDQ2NZW4wajwq5eh4Hx9W69jAyLc/view?usp=sharing>

Expected behavior

The removal of script tags is not sufficient to prevent an XSS attack. You must HTML Entity encode any output that is reflected back to the page

Impact

Commonly include transmitting private data, like cookies or other session information, to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user’s machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.

Desktop (please complete the following information):

OS: Windows

Browser: All

Version

I Hope you fix it ASAP!!!
