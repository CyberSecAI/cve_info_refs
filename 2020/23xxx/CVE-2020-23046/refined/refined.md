- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in several parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, non-persistent XSS vulnerabilities are present in multiple files due to the lack of sanitization of the `filename`, `mid`, `userid`, and `templet` GET parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent redirection to malicious sources, and non-persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote. The vulnerabilities can be exploited by crafting malicious URLs that include the vulnerable parameters with XSS payloads. The method to inject/execute is GET.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers do not need any prior authentication or privileges to exploit these vulnerabilities. They only need to induce a victim to click a crafted URL.
