Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2020-23904.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow exists in the `speexenc.c` file, specifically at line 122, within the `fread` function call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow. The vulnerability is triggered when `fread` reads more data than the buffer `in` can hold.

**Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can cause a remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can achieve RCE by crafting a malicious WAV file.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted WAV file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious WAV file to be processed by `speexenc`. The attacker does not need any special privileges or a position on the network for this to be exploited.
