- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `cat_id` parameter in the `category.php` file is vulnerable to SQL injection because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive database information. The provided information mentions the possibility of using `sqlmap` to extract data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `cat_id` parameter in the `category.php` file. A malicious user can inject SQL code through a crafted HTTP GET request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
