Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities found in the `pdf2json` tool:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **NULL Pointer Dereference**

    *   **Root cause:** A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the `ObjectStream::getObject` function. This happens when the function attempts to access an object via a NULL pointer.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Null pointer dereference
    *   **Impact:**  The program crashes (segmentation fault).
    *   **Attack vector:**  Maliciously crafted PDF file (`00-NULL-pointer-dereference-ObjectStream-getObject.pdf`)
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PDF file.

2.  **Stack Buffer Overflow**

    *  **Root Cause:** The `XRef::fetch` function, along with the `ObjectStream` constructor, leads to a stack overflow due to excessive recursion. This occurs when processing a specific PDF file.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow.
    *   **Impact:**  The program crashes (stack overflow).
    *   **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF file (`01-Stack-buffer-overflow-XRef-fetch.pdf`).
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PDF file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided github content shows two different PoCs for the `pdf2json` tool, both found in the same repository. The first one leads to a NULL pointer dereference, while the second one leads to a stack buffer overflow.
*   The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) output in the provided content highlights the specific locations of the issues.

The content provides more details than a typical CVE description would. It includes the exact function calls and locations where the vulnerabilities occur.
