The provided content discusses a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability reported in the `gopeak/masterlab` repository.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/app/ctrl/Upgrade.php` file.
- The application takes a `source` parameter from the request and uses it to make an HTTP request without proper validation, enabling an attacker to control the destination server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SSRF:** The application fetches external resources based on user-provided input without sanitization.
- Lack of input validation on the `source` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can make the server perform requests to internal or external resources.
- The provided example shows the server fetching data from a `gopher://` URL, which might allow further attacks like internal port scanning, service fingerprinting or interaction with internal services.
- The attacker could potentially bypass firewalls or access resources that are not publicly available.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `Upgrade/run` endpoint by sending a crafted `source` parameter.
- The provided example uses a `gopher://` URL, but other schemes might be vulnerable too, such as `http://`, `https://`, and others depending on the underlying library used to make requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server endpoint.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
