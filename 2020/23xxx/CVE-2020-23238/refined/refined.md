Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Document Manager" feature of Evolution CMS 2.0.2. Specifically, the application does not sanitize or encode user-supplied input before displaying it on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. Malicious code inserted via the "Document Manager" form is reflected back in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the "Document Manager" which are then executed in the browsers of users accessing that functionality.
- The impact includes:
    - Transmitting private data (like cookies, session info) to the attacker.
    - Redirecting victims to attacker-controlled web content.
    - Performing malicious actions in the user's browser under the guise of the vulnerable site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Document Manager" form within the Evolution CMS admin panel.
- An attacker would insert the malicious payload within an input field of the "Document Manager" form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the Evolution CMS admin panel and the "Document Manager" functionality.
- They need to be able to insert malicious code into the "Document Manager" form and trigger it to be reflected back.
