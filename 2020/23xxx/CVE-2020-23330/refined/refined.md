{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a read memory access at address 0x000000000000 (NULL pointer dereference). Specifically, it occurs within the `AP4_Stz2Atom::GetSampleSize` function when trying to access a sample size, indicated by the line `mov ecx,DWORD PTR [rax+rcx*4]` in the disassembly.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference leading to a segmentation fault.",
       "Potential missing bounds check or validation on input values used to index an array, leading to out-of-bounds access."
    ],
    "impact": "The program crashes due to a segmentation fault, leading to denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted input file processed by the `mp42aac` utility.",
       "Fuzzing input to trigger the crash."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted input file to the `mp42aac` utility."
