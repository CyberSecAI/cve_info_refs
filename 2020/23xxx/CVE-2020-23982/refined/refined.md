Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when handling login credentials.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the search functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):**  The login form is susceptible to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79):** The search functionality is susceptible to reflected XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain administrative access to the application.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attack vector is the login form at `/admin/login.php`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attack vector is the search box on the `certificate.php` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to access the login page. No prior authentication is needed to perform the bypass.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable search functionality and be able to trick a victim to click on the crafted URL.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided exploit details the specific payloads that can be used to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   The SQL injection vulnerability allows the attacker to login with a crafted username and a dummy password, bypassing authentication.
* The XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to inject a JavaScript payload to execute arbitrary javascript code in the browser of the victim using the search functionality
*  The software in question is DesignMasterEvents CMS version 1.0.
