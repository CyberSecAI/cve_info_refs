Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-23836 (although the exploit-db entry indicates N/A for CVE, the GitHub issue references CSRF on the same file, so it is likely related)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing CSRF protection mechanism on the `edit_user.php` page within the Warehouse Inventory System. This allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated administrator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application lacks proper CSRF tokens or other protection mechanisms, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Password Change:** A successful CSRF attack can lead to an attacker changing the administrator's password. This results in complete loss of control over the application by the legitimate admin, which would allow the attacker to further compromise the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a malicious website or email containing a crafted HTML form that submits a password change request to the vulnerable `edit_user.php` page.
- An attacker needs to trick an authenticated admin into visiting this crafted malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated in the Warehouse Inventory System.
- The attacker needs to host a malicious page or send a link to it to the targeted admin.
- The attacker needs to know/guess the target IP address of the vulnerable application.
- The attacker must know the parameter names of the password change fields (such as 'password' and 'update-pass' in this case)

**Additional details:**
- The exploit example shows that the vulnerability can be exploited through a simple HTML form with hidden fields, including the target password and the submission parameter.
- The exploit code is specific to the `edit_user.php` page and aims at changing the password.

The exploit-db entry provides the following additional information:
- The vulnerability was identified and reported by Bobby Cooke (boku) and Adeeb Shah (@hyd3sec).
- The affected software is Warehouse Inventory System v1.0 from OSWAPP.
- The exploit code includes specific parameters ('password' and 'update-pass')
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is a Base Score of 7.5 with a high impact.

In summary, the provided content clearly describes a CSRF vulnerability in the Warehouse Inventory System that allows an attacker to change an admin's password by tricking the administrator into accessing a malicious website.
