- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing theme settings, leading to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected XSS vulnerability, inadequate input sanitization, specifically not HTML entity encoding reflected output. The application attempts to prevent XSS by removing script tags but can be bypassed by using HTML event handlers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to account compromise, session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the "Theme Manager" feature in the administrative panel, specifically when managing theme settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a malicious user with access to the administrative panel to exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to navigate to the theme management section and inject the malicious payload.
