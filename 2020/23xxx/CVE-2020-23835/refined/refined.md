Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-23835:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the `index.php` file of the Tailor Management System v1.0. This occurs because the application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on the webpage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, which means malicious script is injected through the URL parameters and reflected back in the response.
*   **Improper Input Neutralization (CWE-79):** The application fails to neutralize or sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Unprotected Transport of Credentials (CWE-523):** While the primary vulnerability is XSS, the exploit script also references that the credentials could be transmitted unprotected, making them susceptible to being captured.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Keylogging:** The provided exploit demonstrates the ability to perform keylogging. An attacker can inject a JavaScript payload through the vulnerable URL. When a user visits this manipulated URL, the injected JavaScript captures the user's keystrokes and sends them to the attacker's server.
*   **Credential Harvesting:** By capturing keystrokes, an attacker can potentially steal login credentials and other sensitive information entered by the victim user.
*  **Information Disclosure:** The XSS vulnerability could be used for other malicious purposes, such as redirecting the user to a phishing page or extracting cookies.
*   **Loss of Integrity:** The injected Javascript can make modifications to the web page, potentially changing the look or behaviour of the intended page.
*   **Loss of Availability:** The injected Javascript could crash the web page on user's browser rendering the service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted URL containing the XSS payload.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the victim to click on the malicious URL, which contains the javascript payload for keylogging.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the XSS vulnerability in the Tailor Management System.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to create a URL that injects the malicious JavaScript payload into the vulnerable page.
*   **Server Setup for Data Capture:** The attacker needs to have a server ready to receive the keylogs that are captured through XSS vulnerability. This includes having a public IP address and the ability to listen on a specific port for the data to be transmitted.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit is specific to version 1.0 of Tailor MS.
*   The Exploit-DB entry provides a Python script to generate the XSS payload and act as a keylogger listener.
*   The CVSS score of 6.4 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L) indicates a medium severity vulnerability. This means it has high confidentiality impact, low integrity and low availability impact, requires a user interaction, and is remotely exploitable over the network. The attack complexity is high, indicating the exploit requires careful crafting.
