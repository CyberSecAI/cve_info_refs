Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23903:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a division by zero error in the `read_samples()` function of the Speex audio codec library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Division by zero vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists when the `channels` variable is equal to zero in the `read_samples()` function within the `speexenc` tool. This condition can arise from processing a specially crafted WAV file where the number of channels is set to zero.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a crash of the `speexenc` application due to the division by zero error, causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a malicious WAV file with a zero value specified for the number of channels.
- An attacker can craft a WAV file with 0 channels to cause the `speexenc` application to crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply the crafted malicious WAV file to a vulnerable `speexenc` application. This can be achieved by having the victim process the crafted audio file, whether it is through user action or automated processing.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `mingw-speex` package.
- Patches have been backported to fix the issue in Fedora 34 and 35.
- The vulnerability is triggered when `channels` is equal to zero in the `to_read` calculation:  `to_read = bits/8*channels*frame_size;`  Within the function `read_samples()`.
- The provided `sample.tar.gz` archive contains a sample file that can be used to reproduce the crash.

The provided content gives specific context on how Fedora addressed this vulnerability by backporting the fix in their package updates. It also provides the vulnerable function and how a crafted file can trigger the vulnerability.
