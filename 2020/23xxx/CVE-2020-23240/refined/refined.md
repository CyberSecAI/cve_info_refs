- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists within the "Logic" field of the Content Manager feature in CMS Made Simple v2.2.14. This field allows users to input code, and it is not properly sanitized, allowing for malicious script injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization in the "Logic" field of the Content Manager.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code which is then executed in the context of other usersâ€™ browsers when they view the affected page. This can lead to actions such as transmitting private data (cookies, session information) to the attacker, redirecting users to attacker-controlled content, or performing malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting a malicious payload (e.g., `<details/open/ontoggle=confirm(1337)>`) into the "Logic" field via the Content Manager feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative access to the CMS Made Simple system to access the Content Manager and the "Logic" field. The attacker must be able to log in to the administrative panel of CMS Made Simple.
