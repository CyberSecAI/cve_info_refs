Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23618:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. This means that the application is taking user-supplied input (in this case, part of the URL path) and including it in the output without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input present in the URL path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
  - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL. The attacker would embed malicious JavaScript code within the path of an error page. When a user accesses this crafted URL, the server will reflect the malicious code back to the user's browser and execute it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious URL to the target users. The user must click on the link while accessing the vulnerable system.
