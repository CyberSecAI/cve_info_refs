Root cause of vulnerability: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating/editing content. Specifically, the application attempts to remove script tags, but does not perform proper HTML entity encoding on the reflected output.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly encode user-supplied data that is reflected in the HTML output.

Impact of exploitation:
  - An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session. This can lead to:
    - Transmitting private data (e.g., cookies, session information) to the attacker.
    - Redirecting the victim to attacker-controlled web content.
    - Performing other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.

Attack vectors:
  - The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the 'Content' feature of the application. Specifically, they can insert an XSS payload in the content blocks, files, or comments.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
  - The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit content in the "Content" module.
