{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user input when saving the site footer in the 'Main settings'. Specifically, it removes script tags but does not perform HTML entity encoding, which is essential to prevent XSS attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the 'Site footer' field in the administration settings panel.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the administration panel. Specifically, they need the privileges to modify the 'Main settings', particularly the 'Site footer' field."
