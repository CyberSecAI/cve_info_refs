{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input validation and sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection (CWE-89)",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability can lead to authentication bypass and unauthorized access to the application's admin panel. The XSS vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "SQL injection through the login form's username field.",
      "XSS through the search box by injecting JavaScript code."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker can leverage the SQL injection in the login form, and the XSS through the search function."
