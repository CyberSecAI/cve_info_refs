Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23710:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the "Notifications & data" feature of LimeSurvey version 4.2.5. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in a "textbox" field, allowing malicious scripts to be injected and executed in the context of the victim's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected XSS: The vulnerability is specifically a reflected XSS, meaning the malicious script is embedded within the request and then reflected back to the user within the page, leading to execution.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The application removes script tags, but this is not sufficient to prevent XSS attacks. HTML Entity encoding of the output is required.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- Data Theft: Attackers can potentially transmit private data, such as cookies or session information, to a server under their control.
- Redirection: Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.
- Malicious Actions: Attackers can perform other malicious operations on the userâ€™s machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User-supplied input in the "textbox" field within the "Notifications & data" feature is not properly sanitized.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered via the "Send basic admin notification email to:" or "Send detailed admin notification email to:" options.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log into the LimeSurvey admin panel.
- Access to the vulnerable feature: The attacker needs to navigate to the "Notifications & data" section of the admin panel, specifically to  `/LimeSurvey-master/index.php/admin/survey/sa/rendersidemenulink/subaction/notification/surveyid/147787`.
- Injection of malicious payload: The attacker needs to insert a malicious payload, like `"><svg/onload=prompt(/NamTV/)>`, into the textbox.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by user `tranvannam186` in a pull request on GitHub.
- The vulnerability was discussed and confirmed in the comments, especially by `Shnoulle` who highlighted the need for proper encoding of output.
- While the vulnerability requires admin access, it is still a concern as it could be used by a compromised admin account to target other admin users.
- The pull request addressing this vulnerability was closed without a direct fix from the reporting user but addressed in subsequent commits.
