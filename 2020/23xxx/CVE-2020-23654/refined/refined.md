- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Shop" module, specifically when creating or editing products, coupons, brands, shipping methods, and payment methods. It inadequately handles script tags but doesn't properly encode output.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application attempts to remove script tags but does not encode HTML entities, allowing for XSS using alternative payloads (e.g., `<details/open/ontoggle=confirm(1337)>`).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to:
  - Transmission of private data, such as cookies or session information, to the attacker.
  - Redirection of the victim to attacker-controlled web content.
  - Execution of other malicious operations on the userâ€™s machine, under the guise of the vulnerable site.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must be an authenticated user to access the admin panel and the "Shop" module. The attacker injects the malicious XSS payload into form fields related to the products, coupons, brands, shipping, or payment methods within the shop module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the NavigateCMS admin panel and the "Shop" module to inject the malicious payload.
