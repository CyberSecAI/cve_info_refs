- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation in the `Displayname` field during user registration, adding, or editing. The application fails to properly encode or parse injected content within the `var` parameter, leading to persistent cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious sources, and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can inject malicious script code via the `Displayname` input field in the registration form, add user, or edit user functionalities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers require low-privileged user accounts (e.g., guest privileges). They can inject the payload through the registration module or via the add/edit user functions if they have access. The injected script is executed when an administrator or privileged user interacts with the profile in various admin sections (preview, edit, listing, delete user).
