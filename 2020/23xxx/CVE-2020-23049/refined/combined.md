Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple persistent input validation web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official Fork CMS v5.8.0 open-source web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to compromise browser to
web-application requests from the application-side.
The persistent input validation web vulnerabilities are located in the `Displayname` input field when using the `Add`, `Edit` or `Register`
mechanism that forwards the information into the `var` parameter. Remote attackers and privileged application user accounts are able to
inject own malicious persistent script code as the users displayname by usage of the registration module (/profiles/register). Privileged
users with access to the profile or users module are able to exploit the issue by a simple inject. The displayname then becomes visible in
the Admin - Profiles Index on Preview, Edit User/Profile, Delete User Interaction and User Index in Listing modules. the var parameter
does not encode or parse the exisiting injected content and executes it. The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector of the
vulnerability is located on the application-side of the content management system. The injection point is located in the registration form
and the add/edit user function. The execution point of the issue occurs in the preview profile, edit user, user index listing and delete
user message context.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to
malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.
Request Method(s):
[+] POST
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Register
[+] Add User
[+] Edit User
Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Displayname
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] var
Affected Module(s):
[+] Preview Profile

[+] Delete User
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information an steüs below to continue.
Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Open the fork cms web-application newst version
2. Move via sitemap or by link to the registration page (/modules/profiles/register)
3. Inject your script code payload html/js to the Displayname input field
4. Register the account by pushing submit
5. Activate the link in the account registration email
Note: Now simple wait until the administrator / privileged user visits the panel to execute the code on interaction or preview only
6. Successful reproduce of the persistent script code injection vulnerability!
