- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `userid` and `password` parameters of the `/authen/start/` (login/logout) module of the LANCOM WLAN Controller. Specifically, the input fields are not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious script code.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Non-persistent XSS vulnerability due to the lack of input sanitization in the `userid` and `password` parameters.
    - The vulnerability exists in the login form of the web-based administration interface.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Session hijacking
    - Non-persistent phishing attacks
    - Non-persistent external redirects to malicious sources
    - Non-persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.

- **Attack vectors**:
    -  Remote unauthenticated attackers can connect to the guest wifi, access the login page and inject malicious scripts in the username and password fields via a POST request.
    - The vulnerability can also be triggered with a simple logout GET method request via the refresh parameter.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be within the range of the guest Wi-Fi network.
    - The attacker does not need any credentials and can connect with guest permissions to the public Wi-Fi hotspot of the affected LANCOM device.
    - The attacker must have a web browser to interact with the login page.
    - Low user interaction.
