- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the login form, specifically the username field, before using it in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability in `/Admin/login.php`
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and log in as an administrator without knowing the actual credentials. This allows them to gain full control over the application and its data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the login form itself, where a malicious payload can be inserted in the username field. The vulnerability can be triggered via a crafted SQL injection payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the login page and input the malicious SQL injection payload in the username field. In this case, a WAF bypass is needed. The attacker needs to substitute `=` with `like` in the injected SQL query to bypass the web application firewall.
