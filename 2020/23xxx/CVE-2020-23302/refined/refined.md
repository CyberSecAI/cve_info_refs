The provided content describes a heap-use-after-free vulnerability in JerryScript.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability occurs due to a use-after-free condition in the `ecma_ref_ecma_string` function. This is triggered during the creation of a regular expression object, which involves string operations that can free allocated memory. Subsequently the code attempts to access the freed memory, leading to the crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Heap-use-after-free:** A memory block is freed, and later, the program attempts to access the same memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution if the memory is corrupted in a controlled way

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation through crafted JavaScript code that triggers the specific sequence of operations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute JavaScript code within a JerryScript environment. The provided code sample demonstrates the exploit.
