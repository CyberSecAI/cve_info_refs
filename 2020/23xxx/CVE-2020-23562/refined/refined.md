Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23562:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a user-mode write access violation that occurs within the IrfanView software when processing a crafted DCR file. Specifically, the issue stems from a flaw in the `FORMATS.dll` plugin during the `ShowPlugInSaveOptions_W` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **User-Mode Write Access Violation:** The core vulnerability is that the program attempts to write data to a memory location that it does not have permission to access, causing a crash.
- The vulnerability occurs within the `FORMATS.dll` plugin, specifically within the `ShowPlugInSaveOptions_W` function at offset `0x000000000000aefe` which corresponds to the instruction `fstp dword ptr [eax]`. This instruction attempts to write a floating-point value to the memory address pointed to by the EAX register. The memory address is invalid resulting in the crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User-Mode Write Access Violation:** This vulnerability leads to a program crash.
- While the description focuses on the crash, it's possible that carefully crafted input could lead to a more significant impact, such as code execution, but the provided information doesn't confirm this.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to entice a user to open a specially crafted DCR file with the vulnerable version of IrfanView.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious DCR file.
- The attacker would have to make the user open the malicious file locally using the vulnerable version of IrfanView
- The attacker requires no special privileges to carry out the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information is more detailed than a standard CVE description.
- The vendor fixed the vulnerability in the plugin, and users are advised to update.
- Multiple similar vulnerabilities are listed, all related to the handling of different file formats by the FORMATS.dll plugin in IrfanView 4.54.
