{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on the web page. Specifically, the `AppName` parameter, which is provided through the executor management functionality, is directly used for front-end display without any filtering or encoding.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser when they access the affected page. This can potentially lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the `AppName` parameter in the executor management page. This malicious code is then stored in the application's database and is executed whenever a user views the relevant page.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the executor management functionality. This likely requires having administrative or similar privileges within the application."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present because the backend only has length validation on the input and not proper sanitization. The front-end validation can be bypassed using a tool like Burp Suite."
