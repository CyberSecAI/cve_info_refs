The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in the Playable v9.18 iOS application, both related to insecure handling of file uploads.

**1. Persistent Script Code Injection:**

*   **Root Cause:** Insecure handling of the `filename` parameter in the upload module allows injection of malicious script code.
*   **Vulnerability:** Persistent script code injection. The application fails to sanitize or encode the filename during the upload process.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code, leading to session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent redirects to malicious sources, and manipulation of the mobile application's UI.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A remote attacker with wifi access can perform a POST request to the upload endpoint (`http://localhost:8881/upload`). The malicious code is embedded within the `filename` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be on the same wifi network as the vulnerable iOS device and be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests.

**2. Arbitrary File Upload:**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing file parsing and insecure upload handling of file extensions within the upload module.
*   **Vulnerability:** Arbitrary file upload. The application does not properly validate file extensions, allowing the upload of files with malicious content.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can upload and execute malicious files on the local web server, potentially compromising the mobile application.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker with wifi access can upload a file with a manipulated filename (e.g., `clay.js.jpg`). Then, the attacker can request the file (e.g., `http://localhost/vid/clay.js`) to execute the javascript code by removing the added extension.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be on the same wifi network as the vulnerable iOS device.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

Both vulnerabilities stem from the same insecure upload handling within the Playable app:

*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization and proper file extension validation.
*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulated file uploads via the `filename` parameter.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, UI manipulation, potential app compromise.

The provided information includes detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerabilities, including the necessary HTTP request data. The report also suggests remediation by sanitizing the filename parameter, and restricting file extensions.
