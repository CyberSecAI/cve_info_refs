## Description

![@Jayway007](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22486282?u=b799cfa4827f77f7cb3a00a4d8cc391fb2e4d478&v=4&size=48)[Jayway007](https://github.com/Jayway007)opened [on Apr 29, 2020](https://github.com/halo-dev/halo/issues/806#issue-608857881)

1、Because the password of the login account of the system background is transmitted in plain text, it can easily enter the background through brute force cracking：

2、The problem lies in the STMP server configuration，which can specify host address and port

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22486282/80572842-85244a00-8a31-11ea-97d1-114dc29492b6.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22486282/80572842-85244a00-8a31-11ea-97d1-114dc29492b6.png)

3、There is a hidden testConnection () interface in the code to test the connectivity of the mailbox server

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22486282/80573022-d3394d80-8a31-11ea-8659-de5485422abd.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22486282/80573022-d3394d80-8a31-11ea-8659-de5485422abd.png)

4、It is a javaMailSender that depends on springframework：

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22486282/80573189-1abfd980-8a32-11ea-8b88-1ba36bcf862e.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22486282/80573189-1abfd980-8a32-11ea-8b88-1ba36bcf862e.png)

5、So you can test through this interface, write the address as 127.0.0.1，When the server port is open, the corresponding time is shorter：20millis：

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22486282/80573371-696d7380-8a32-11ea-9d3d-11318930a8e8.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22486282/80573371-696d7380-8a32-11ea-9d3d-11318930a8e8.png)

6、The port is not open, the corresponding time is longer：1000+millis：

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22486282/80573634-e00a7100-8a32-11ea-9170-86658130cd98.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22486282/80573634-e00a7100-8a32-11ea-9170-86658130cd98.png)

7、You can obtain the open ports of the server and other hosts on the intranet in batches according to the length of the echo time, and then carry out further attacks
