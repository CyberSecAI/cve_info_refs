Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23620:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied data within the Java Remote Management Interface of Orlansoft ERP.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The application is vulnerable to insecure deserialization, which occurs when the application deserializes data from an untrusted source without proper validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a specially crafted serialized Java object to the vulnerable interface.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack can be performed remotely, via the network, by sending a malicious serialized Java object.
*   **Java Remote Management Interface:** The vulnerability is located in the Java Remote Management Interface of the Orlansoft ERP system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Java Remote Management Interface of the Orlansoft ERP.
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious serialized Java object that will execute their desired code when deserialized by the application.
