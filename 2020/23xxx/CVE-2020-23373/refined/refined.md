Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `admin/nav/add.html` page of noneCMS v1.3.0. Specifically, the `name` parameter is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not sanitize user-provided input before storing it in the database/system. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are later executed in the browsers of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browsers of other users who access the affected page.
- **Session Hijacking:**  Attackers can steal user session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to accounts.
- **Malware Distribution:** Malicious scripts can be used to redirect users to other websites, potentially distributing malware or phishing pages.
- **Data theft and modification**: Manipulate the page's content, potentially stealing data or performing unauthorized actions on the user's behalf.
- **Defacement:** Modification of displayed content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST request:** The attacker sends a POST request to `/nonecms/public/index.php/admin/nav/add.html` with a malicious script embedded in the `name` parameter.
- **Web Browser:** When the stored malicious payload is retrieved, other administrative users who visit affected pages will be exposed to the injected script via the web browser.
- **Front end users:** When the front end users visit the affected column, the same XSS vulnerability is exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker must have an account with the rights to modify the navigation settings within the noneCMS application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the noneCMS application.

**Additional details:**

- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker could inject a simple JavaScript alert.
- The vulnerability affects not only other administrators when they access the admin area, but also front-end users when accessing the vulnerable column.

This is a stored XSS vulnerability because the malicious script is stored and then executed when other users access the affected page/data.
