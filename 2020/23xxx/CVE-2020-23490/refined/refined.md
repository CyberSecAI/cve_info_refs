Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in AVideo, as described in the cube01.io article:

**1. Privilege Escalation via Configuration File Deletion**

*   **Root Cause:** The `objects/import.json.php` file allows users with upload permissions to delete arbitrary files, including the critical `configuration.php` file, by manipulating the `$_POST['fileURI']` parameter and setting `$_POST['delete']`.
*   **Weakness:** The `unlink()` function in PHP is used on a path derived from user input without sufficient sanitization, leading to arbitrary file deletion.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Deleting `configuration.php` resets the application, forcing a re-installation.
    *   Allows an attacker to escalate privileges by exploiting the application's initial setup, bypassing restrictions, and potentially gaining admin access if the attacker controls the new setup.
    *   Bypasses admin restrictions in a "safe mode" where admin capabilities are limited
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Send a POST request to `objects/import.json.php`
    *   Include `delete=1` and `fileURI=../videos/configuration.php` in the POST data.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   User with upload permissions, while the `doNotShowImportMP4Button` option is disabled.
    *   Admin user with disabled dangerous functions.

**2. File Inclusion Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The `plugin/LiveLinks/proxy.php` file uses `url_get_contents()` on a URL from the `$_GET['livelink']` parameter without proper validation, allowing for file inclusion by using URI schemes like `file://`.
*   **Weakness:** The application attempts to validate the URL, but it does not prevent file inclusion.
*   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive files like `configuration.php`, which contains database credentials.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Send a GET request to `/plugin/LiveLinks/proxy.php`
    *   Include a `livelink` parameter with a file URI, e.g., `file:///C:/xampp/htdocs/AVideo/videos/configuration.php`
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     *   No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability

**3. Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `install/checkConfiguration.php` allows for the injection of PHP code into the `configuration.php` via the `$_POST['salt']` parameter during the setup process, allowing arbitrary PHP execution.
*   **Weakness:** Unsanitized user input is used to populate a configuration file, resulting in code injection.
*  **Impact:** Enables the execution of arbitrary OS commands on the server when the crafted `configuration.php` is accessed through a crafted URL.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    * Send a POST request to `install/checkConfiguration.php` with a malicious PHP code payload in the `salt` parameter, example:  `123'; exec($_GET["x"]);//`.
    *   After that, access `videos/configuration.php` with the `x` parameter to execute OS commands.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * Requires control of the new AVideo setup to inject malicious `salt` value into the configuration file.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Chain:**

1.  **Privilege Escalation:** Delete the `configuration.php` file using `import.json.php`.
2.  **File Inclusion:** Read the `configuration.php` file using `LiveLinks/proxy.php` to obtain database credentials.
3.  **Remote Code Execution:** Inject PHP code via `install/checkConfiguration.php` into the `configuration.php` file. Then, use the injected code to execute OS commands.
4.  **Exploit script:** An exploit script is provided that automates these steps to gain a reverse shell.

**Additional Details from the Github Commit:**
The provided commit from Github ([https://github.com/WWBN/AVideo/commit/218c98cbd4a4a2c15745852bcd0f29faf101bd8c](https://github.com/WWBN/AVideo/commit/218c98cbd4a4a2c15745852bcd0f29faf101bd8c)) shows a fix for the file inclusion vulnerability in `plugin/LiveLinks/proxy.php`. The fix adds a check to ensure that the `livelink` parameter starts with "http" and also performs a `filter_var()` check for valid URLs. This mitigates the arbitrary file inclusion via the `file://` URI scheme.

```
if (!filter_var($_GET['livelink'], FILTER_VALIDATE_URL) || !preg_match("/^http.\*/i", $_GET['livelink'])) {
```

The commit provides additional context by showing a patch for the file inclusion issue, confirming the vulnerability and providing a timeline.
