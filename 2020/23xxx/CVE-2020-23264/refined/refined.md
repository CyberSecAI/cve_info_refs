The provided content is related to CVE-2020-23264.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Fork CMS application was missing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks on various actions that make changes without using forms. This meant that an attacker could potentially make unauthorized changes if a victim user was tricked into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage while logged into the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing CSRF protection on actions that modify data without using forms, including:
  - Resetting analytics
  - Blog mass comment actions
  - Installing modules
  - Restoring deleted users
  - Running mass actions in tags, profiles, media library, and form builder modules
  - Returning the profiles export template
  - Pinging the mailmotor API
  - Exporting locale
  - AJAX calls

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user, such as:
- Modifying data
- Installing malicious modules
- Resetting analytics
- Modifying blog comments
- Mass actions in various modules (tags, profiles, media library, formbuilder)
- Exporting user data
- Pinging the mailmotor API

**Attack vectors:**
- Tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link.
- Hosting a malicious webpage that performs unauthorized actions against the vulnerable application while the victim user is logged in.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to entice a user of the vulnerable Fork CMS application to visit a malicious link or webpage.
- The user has to be logged in to the Fork CMS application for the attack to succeed.
