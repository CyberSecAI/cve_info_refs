## Description

![@weinull](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16414933?u=5812744534b7f6c9091c9b5789c0a3ddc30486da&v=4&size=48)[weinull](https://github.com/weinull)opened [on May 12, 2020](https://github.com/electerm/electerm/issues/1686#issue-616776876)
## Electerm version:

All versions

## Operating system(linux, macos, or windows7/8/10?):

All operating system(macos,windows7/8/10,linux)

## Detailed Description

Electerm did not conduct permission checks, which led to remote command execution vulnerabilities.

After testing, it affected Electerm on all operating systems.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.Open Electerm and keep it running.

2.Use a browser such as Chrome / Firefox / Safari to visit the malicious site I constructed: <http://orz.weinull.com/orz-001.html>

3.Malicious site executes command to open calculator.

## Suggestions

Generate a random token for service invocation at startup, and at the same time, ensure that the token has enough complexity to be guessed

#### Electerm is a very good tool, hope to develop better
