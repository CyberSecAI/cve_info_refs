Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) issue in the `/personal/updateInfo` endpoint. The application uses the `userid` parameter from the request to directly query and update user information without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **IDOR:** The application directly uses user-provided IDs to access and modify resources. It does not verify if the authenticated user has the privilege to access and modify data associated with the provided `userid`.
- **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The system does not validate if the user making the request is authorized to modify the information of the `userid` they specified.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can modify the personal information of any user by simply changing the `userid` parameter in the `/personal/updateInfo` request. This includes fields such as user's name, address, phone number, and other details depending on what is exposed by the API.
- This could potentially lead to:
    - Identity theft and fraud.
    - Data manipulation and corruption.
    - Account takeover in conjunction with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attacker sends a POST request to the `/personal/updateInfo` endpoint.
-  The `userid` parameter in the request payload is modified to target a victim user's ID.
- The other required parameters are set to desired values, such as the new user information to be updated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a logged-in user.
- The attacker must know or be able to guess/enumerate valid `userid` values.
- The attacker must be able to craft HTTP POST requests.
