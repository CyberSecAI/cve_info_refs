Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an improper implementation of the authentication logic in the `AdminLoginInterceptor`. The interceptor is designed to protect the `/admin` backend, but it fails to handle requests with a double slash `//` in the URL. This allows an attacker to bypass the authentication check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The core weakness is that the system's authentication check can be completely bypassed by using a double slash in the URL path (e.g., `//admin`).
*  **URL Canonicalization Issue**: The application does not correctly normalize or sanitize URLs, leading to the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain full access to the administrative interface without having valid credentials.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can upload malicious files to the server, which can then be executed, leading to command execution on the server.
*   **System Takeover:** The ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Data Breaches:** Through the compromised server, sensitive information can be exposed.
*   **Service Disruption:** The compromised server can be used to interrupt or degrade the service for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker sends an HTTP request to the web server with a modified URL containing double slashes (e.g., `//admin`). This bypasses the standard authentication mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable URL:** The attacker needs to know the location of the administrative interface (e.g., `/admin`) and discover the double slash bypass method.

This issue allows the attacker to fully bypass the admin login authentication and upload a malicious file which will then be executed on the server, allowing command execution.
