The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Configuration" module of NavigateCMS version 2.9.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization when creating or modifying configuration entries within the NavigateCMS admin panel. Specifically, the application attempts to mitigate XSS by removing script tags, which is inadequate. The application fails to HTML entity encode user-supplied data that is reflected back into the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript code can be injected and permanently stored in the database and subsequently executed when a user views the affected configuration pages.
- Insufficient Input Sanitization: The application's attempt to remove script tags is not a robust way to prevent XSS attacks. The input sanitization logic can be easily bypassed.
- Lack of HTML Entity Encoding: User-provided data is not properly encoded before being rendered in the HTML page, allowing the browser to interpret the injected script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Theft:** An attacker can steal session cookies or other sensitive information that can be used to impersonate the victim user.
- **Redirection:** Users could be redirected to attacker controlled websites.
- **Malicious Operations:** An attacker could perform malicious actions on the user's machine, under the context of the vulnerable website (e.g., modifying user data, performing unwanted actions).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the admin panel.
- The attacker injects the XSS payload into a configuration setting (e.g., user, profile, menu, function, or backup related settings) via the "Create" function.
- When an administrator views the configuration pages, the injected malicious code is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user with admin panel access.
- Ability to create new records through the Configuration Module.

**Payload:**
- The attacker used the following payload:  `'><details/open/ontoggle=confirm(1337)>` which demonstrates XSS exploitation. This payload leverages the `<details>` HTML tag which, upon being opened via the `open` attribute, triggers the `ontoggle` event handler which in turn executes the JavaScript `confirm(1337)` function, causing a pop-up with the text `1337`.
