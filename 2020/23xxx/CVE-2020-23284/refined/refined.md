The provided content relates to CVE-2020-23284.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a sensitive data exposure vulnerability stemming from broken access control in the MV's IDCE application v1.0. Specifically, the application allows direct access to aspx pages that connect to the database without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Broken Access Control:** The application fails to enforce proper access control, allowing unauthenticated users to access sensitive pages.
-   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Direct access to aspx pages leads to the exposure of internal and sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information such as usernames, names, birth dates, Brazilian regional Council of medicine (CRM), and Brazilian registration of individuals (CPF) without being logged in.
-   **Privacy Violation:** Exposure of this personal data can lead to privacy violations and potential misuse of the exposed information.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **Direct URL Access:** Attackers can directly access the vulnerable aspx pages by entering the URLs in a browser.
    Example URLs:
        -   `http://your_domain/idce/Medicos.aspx`
        -   `http://your_domain/idce/SegUsuario.aspx`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **No Authentication Required:** Attackers do not need to be logged into the web application.
-   **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the application server to access the vulnerable URLs.
