The provided content is related to CVE-2020-23861.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a heap overflow in the `read_system_page` function within `decode_r2007.c`. Specifically, the issue lies within a `memcpy` call where the size of the data being copied, `size_uncomp`, exceeds the allocated buffer's size. The condition `if (size_comp < size_uncomp)` leads to decompression or a direct memcpy, and in the memcpy case, there is no check on the size being copied leading to the overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A heap-based buffer overflow occurs because the memcpy operation copies more data than the allocated buffer can hold.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by submitting a specially crafted DWG file. This can lead to the program crashing.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious DWG file submitted to the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious DWG file to a program using the vulnerable LibreDWG library.

**Additional Details:**
The provided information contains more details than a typical CVE description including:
- Specific line of code vulnerable in `decode_r2007.c`.
- AddressSanitizer and GDB outputs highlighting the overflow
- Step to reproduce the vulnerability with a provided PoC file.
- Registers and stack information during the overflow.
- The vulnerability is located in the `read_system_page` function when the size\_comp is not less than size\_uncomp, there is no check of the `size_uncomp` parameter before the `memcpy` operation.
