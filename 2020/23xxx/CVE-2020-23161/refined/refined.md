Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23161:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a local file inclusion (LFI) flaw within the Pyrescom Termod4 time management devices. Specifically, the `Maintenance > Logs` menu allows users to manipulate the file path within the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include and display arbitrary files from the device's local filesystem. This is due to insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied file paths.
*   **Path Traversal:** Attackers can use "../" sequences in the URL to traverse directories and access files outside of the intended log directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the device, potentially exposing confidential data, configuration files, and other sensitive information.
*   **Credential Exposure:** When combined with CVE-2020-23162, attackers can leverage the LFI vulnerability to read session files and obtain plain-text user credentials.
*   **Chained Attacks:** This vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities such as CVE-2020-23160 (Remote Code Execution) and CVE-2020-23162 (Sensitive Information Disclosure) to gain deeper access and control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network by sending HTTP requests to the device's web server.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the file path within the URL to read arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the Pyrescom Termod4 device's web server.
*   **No Authentication Required** (when chained with other vulnerabilities): The PoC indicates that by chaining CVE-2020-23161 and CVE-2020-23162, it is possible to bypass authentication and obtain credentials.
*  **Knowledge of the Device's File System Structure** is helpful to target specific files that contain sensitive information.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content is related to a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit that demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited.
*   The vulnerability is confirmed to be fixed in version 10.04k, the exploit was discovered on version 10.02r.
*  The vulnerability was discovered by Jonas Mattsson and Hugo van den Toorn from Outpost24.
*  The information in the github repo indicates that a screenshot of the web server interface can be taken.
