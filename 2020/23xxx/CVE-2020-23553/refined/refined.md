Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23553:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in how IrfanView handles a crafted DDS file within the `FORMATS.dll` plugin, specifically during the `GetPlugInInfo` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **User-Mode Write Access Violation:** The core issue is that the program attempts to write to a memory location that it does not have permission to access, resulting in a crash or other unpredictable behavior.
- Specifically, the instruction `rep movs dword ptr es:[edi], dword ptr [esi]` at `FORMATS!GetPlugInInfo+0x7d33` attempts to copy data from a source buffer to a destination buffer, but the destination address `edi` points to an invalid memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User-Mode Write Access Violation:** This vulnerability leads to a user-mode write access violation which crashes the application. The content does not provide any evidence for further impact, such as remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to get a crafted DDS file opened by a user using the vulnerable IrfanView application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious DDS file.
- The attacker must get the user to open the crafted DDS file with the vulnerable IrfanView version.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor addressed the issue by fixing the error in the plugin as indicated by the provided information.
- The affected component is the `FORMATS.dll` plugin, specifically while reading a DDS file.
- The specific instruction `rep movs dword ptr es:[edi], dword ptr [esi]` at offset `0x7d33` of the `GetPlugInInfo` function is the point of failure.
