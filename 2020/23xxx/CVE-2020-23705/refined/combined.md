## Description

![@WayneDevMaze](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20449005?u=6d0bcaf3507d2bf2119fb66b510d875011087ec3&v=4&size=48)[WayneDevMaze](https://github.com/WayneDevMaze)opened [on Jun 22, 2020](https://github.com/rockcarry/ffjpeg/issues/25#issue-642861272)
### Describe

A global-buffer-overflow was discovered in ffjpeg. The issue is being triggered in function jfif\_encode at jfif.c:701

### Reproduce

Tested in Ubuntu 18.04, 64bit. Compile ffjpeg with address sanitizer as I changed `CCFLAGS` src/Makefile as:

```
# ASan
CCFLAGS = -Wall -g -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -O1
```

And do this command to reproduce this issue:

`ffjpeg -e $poc`

[poc is here](https://github.com/WayneDevMaze/afl_test_works/blob/master/ffjpeg/poc/global-buffer-overflow-poc1)

### Expected behavior

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious jpeg that exploits this issue. This will result in a Denial of Service (DoS) and when the application attempts to process the file.

### ASAN Reports

```
