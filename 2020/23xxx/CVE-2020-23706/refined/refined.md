The provided content describes a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the `ok_file_formats` library, specifically within the `ok_jpg_decode_block_subsequent_scan` function located in `ok_jpg.c`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow that occurs when decoding a specially crafted JPEG image. The function `ok_jpg_decode_block_subsequent_scan` attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A read operation attempts to access memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer in the heap memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash: The program crashes due to the memory access violation detected by the AddressSanitizer.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: While not explicitly stated, heap-buffer-overflow vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution in some cases, depending on memory layout and exploit techniques.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious JPEG file: The attacker crafts a malicious JPEG file that, when parsed by the vulnerable library, triggers the heap-buffer-overflow condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted JPEG file to the application using the vulnerable library.
- The attacker needs no special privileges.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability is located at `ok_jpg.c:1102` inside function `ok_jpg_decode_block_subsequent_scan()`.
- The test program and compilation steps, including ASan usage, are provided.
- A specific crash test case file is referenced.
- The issue was discovered using the AFL fuzzer, and the crashing test case is in the project's test directory.
