{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization on the 'PingTest' parameter within the '/diag_tracert_admin.asp' page. The application does not properly validate user input before using it in a command, allowing for command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
      "Insufficient Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the affected device with the same privileges as the web server. This could lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious request to the '/diag_tracert_admin.asp' endpoint, injecting operating system commands into the 'PingTest' parameter using the '|' character.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker only needs network access to the affected device."
