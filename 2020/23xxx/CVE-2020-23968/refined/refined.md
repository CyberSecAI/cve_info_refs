{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ILEX International Sign&go software has overly permissive access rights on its logging directory `C:\\ProgramData\\Ilex\\S&G\\Logs`, which inherits permissions from `C:\\ProgramData`, allowing any authenticated user to read and write to it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure file system permissions",
      "Privileged file operations by the SYSTEM service without impersonation"
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation to SYSTEM by leveraging the ability to write to the logging directory to create arbitrary files, allowing for techniques like DLL hijacking on the SYSTEM service process `sngWSService.exe`.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access by any authenticated user",
       "Abuse of Windows filesystem features (Object Manager Symbolic Links)"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system where ILEX International Sign&go is installed and have the ability to write to the `C:\\ProgramData\\Ilex\\S&G\\Logs` directory. They need to be able to cause the service to write to the log file by either disconnecting from the network or waiting for the service to write an error message."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided content gives a more comprehensive explanation of the vulnerability and its exploitation than the official CVE description. It includes details on the vulnerable software version, the specific directory permissions, the exploitation steps using object manager symbolic links, and proof-of-concept exploit code."
