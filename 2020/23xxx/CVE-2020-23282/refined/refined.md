Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23282:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an improperly handled 'user' field in the mConnect MV application's login page, where user-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries when handling the 'user' field.
- Lack of Input Validation: The application does not validate or sanitize user input in the 'user' field, allowing the injection of malicious SQL code.
- Usage of outdated software: The software version affected is discontinued, and no longer receives security updates from the vendor.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authentication Bypass: Attackers can bypass the authentication mechanism by injecting SQL code into the 'user' field, effectively logging in without valid credentials.
- Data Breach: Once authenticated, attackers could gain unauthorized access to the application's database, potentially extracting sensitive information, or even executing arbitrary commands on the database server.
- Full database access.
- Possible OS command execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is accessible over the network through the application's login page.
- Input Field: The 'user' field in the login form is the direct attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Basic SQL knowledge: The attacker needs basic understanding of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques.
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to access the application's login page.
- No specific privileges are needed for initial exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable software is mConnect MV, specifically versions 02.001.00 and 2013.1.6.8.
- The application uses an Oracle database.
- The vulnerability is a partial SQL injection because although the user field can be exploited via SQLi, the password field is sanitized and does not allow for the injection of special characters.
- The attacker can use tools such as SQLMap to automate the process of exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
- The vendor recommends using the updated replacement application Vivace Connect.
