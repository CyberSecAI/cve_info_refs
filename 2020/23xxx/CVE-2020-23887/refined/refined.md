Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: Heap Overflow in pict file format handling**

*   **Root cause:** The application does not properly handle specifically crafted pict files, leading to a heap overflow when processing them.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Heap overflow.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  A heap overflow can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service (application crash). The provided crash analysis shows a write access violation at address `0xffffffffffff0003` within the `ntdll!RtlpLowFragHeapFree` function, indicating a memory corruption vulnerability. The crash analysis explicitly identifies it as "EXPLOITABLE".
*   **Attack vectors:** Opening a specially crafted pict file using XnView.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious pict file to the user, requiring some form of social engineering or local access to the machine.

**Vulnerability 2: Access Violation in ico file format handling**

*   **Root cause:** The application does not properly handle specifically crafted ico files, leading to an access violation when processing them.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Read Access Violation.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The provided crash analysis shows a read access violation at address `0x3afe7df` within the `USER32!SmartStretchDIBits` function which can lead to a denial of service (application crash).  The crash analysis classifies the exploitability as "UNKNOWN", requiring further research.
*   **Attack vectors:** Opening a specially crafted ico file using XnView.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious ico file to the user, requiring some form of social engineering or local access to the machine.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The report mentions the vulnerabilities were tested on XnView MP Version 0.96.4 (Jun 30 2020), but the XnView website indicates the current version is 1.8.3 as of the time the document was created, meaning that the vulnerabilities may still be present
*   The `!exploitable` output provides detailed crash information, including the faulting address, exception type, and call stack which helps to assess exploitability and create a proof of concept.
*   The provided information goes beyond the basic description of the CVE by detailing the specific file formats affected, the nature of the memory corruption and the locations in the call stack that trigger it.
