The provided content describes a vulnerability in PHPFusion related to broken authentication and session management, which aligns with the description of CVE-2020-23178.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly destroy session cookies upon user logout.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Session cookies persist after logout.
- Session management is not secure, allowing for session reuse.
- Failure to invalidate cookies after logout.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can reuse old session cookies to regain access to a user's account even after the user has logged out.
- This allows the attacker to modify account information and potentially perform other actions as the compromised user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to obtain the session cookies of a logged-in user (e.g., by intercepting network traffic).
- They can then save those cookies.
- After the user logs out, the attacker can inject/import these old cookies into their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the victim's session cookies. This could be through network interception or by other means if the cookies are not HttpOnly.
- The attacker needs to have access to a browser where they can inject cookies.
