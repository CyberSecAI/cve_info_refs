**Describe the bug**

Hello every one, I have found a small vulnerbility your PHP Fusion.

Here is the error details.(Broken Authentication and session management PHP Fusionon)

Cookies are used to maintain session of the particular user and they should expire once the user logs out of his PHP Fusion account.In secure web application,Cookies immediately expire once the user logs out of his account.

But this is not happening in the case of HP Fusion same cookies can be used again and again to open the session of the victim.

In this Loop Hole The Application does not destroy session after logout.. means the cookies are working to login to user account & change account Information, The Cookies are usable i'm able to access the account & edit info.

If anything is wrong please reponse to me. Thank you.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Login to your account.......
2. Get the cookies using " Brub Suite" or "EditThisCookie"
3. Logout from the account...
4. Clear all the cookies related to PHP Fusion
5. Save the cookies you copied in a text file...
6. Now Injact/Import Old Cookies to the PHP Fusion by "EditThisCookie"...
7. As u can see.. you will be again logged In to PHP Fusion .. using old session cookies..

For More Information about This Vulnerability You can check OWASP Guide
