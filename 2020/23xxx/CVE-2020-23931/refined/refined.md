Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the `abst_box_read` function within the `box_code_adobe.c` file of the GPAC library.
*   **Weakness:** The `abst_box_read` function reads strings from a bitstream, and a size-related issue leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when calling `strdup`, which is used to duplicate the read string. The code reads a size, allocates memory with malloc, and reads the specified number of bytes.  However the size can be larger than the remaining data, causing the overflow. There are multiple instances of this issue within the function, related to reading different strings: movie identifier, server entry, quality entry, and meta data.

*   **Impact:** A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution by overflowing the heap, potentially allowing an attacker to take control of the system.

*  **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a crafted MP4 file (or similar format) containing a specially crafted "abst" box.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed file to the vulnerable application or system.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in the `abst_box_read` function at multiple locations (lines 109 and 155 were explicitly reported, but code inspection reveals it's also at line 128, 148, and 162).
*   The code reads a string from a bitstream into a temporary buffer (`tmp_str`) and duplicates it using `gf_strdup()`. `gf_strdup` is essentially a `malloc` and then a `strcpy`, similar to the standard `strdup()`.  If the size of the string from the bitstream is larger than the allocated memory or read incorrectly, this can lead to a buffer overflow.
*   The provided AddressSanitizer output shows a heap-buffer-overflow when calling `strdup`. It indicates a read of size 13 at a memory address, which is beyond a previously allocated 12-byte region, indicating a write of 13 bytes into a buffer of 12 bytes.
*  The fix commit modifies the code to ensure proper size handling while reading the strings. Specifically, the fix adds a loop that decreases the size counter on each read byte, preventing the reads from surpassing the allocated memory.

**CVE Relevance:**

The provided information directly relates to CVE-2020-23931, as it describes a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the GPAC library, specifically within the `box_code_adobe.c` file, as confirmed by the issue report and the patch.  The descriptions are consistent and detail a buffer overflow that would cause the issues mentioned in the CVE.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `abst_box_read` function of GPAC when processing certain boxes. It can be triggered by a malformed input file and results in memory corruption. The attacker can achieve remote code execution with a carefully crafted exploit. The fix implements correct size tracking during string reads.
