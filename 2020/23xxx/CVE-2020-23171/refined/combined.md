## Description

![@jiahao42](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12411648?u=f24223df26d1f6311dcf3273ceab74f0fc4a6d83&v=4&size=48)[jiahao42](https://github.com/jiahao42)opened [on May 10, 2020](https://github.com/nim-lang/zip/issues/54#issue-615302437)
### Issue

Given a crafted zip file containing a file of filename `../../../../../../../../tmp/evil.txt`, zip will extract the file to `/tmp/evil.txt`, while actually it should be extracted to `./tmp/evil.txt`. This vulnerability could allow the attacker to write a file to an arbitrary directory.

### How to reproduce

You can try to reproduce this vulnerability using [this zip file](https://github.com/jiahao42/PoC/raw/master/zip%40nim-lang/tests/files/evil.zip), note that the symbol `nim -d:useLibzipSrc` is needed for compilation. You can find the PoC [here](https://github.com/jiahao42/PoC/tree/master/zip%40nim-lang)
