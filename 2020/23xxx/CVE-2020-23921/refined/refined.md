- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs within the `yy::yylex(Context&)` function at `asn_compiler.hpp:11676` due to an out-of-bounds read during parsing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow, out-of-bounds read
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability leads to a crash due to an AddressSanitizer error and memory corruption, which could potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a crafted ASN.1 input file to the `fast_ber_compiler`. The specific input file that triggers the crash is provided in the attached zip file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious ASN.1 file to the vulnerable `fast_ber_compiler` tool.
