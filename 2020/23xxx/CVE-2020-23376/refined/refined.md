The provided content describes a CSRF vulnerability in NoneCMS v1.3.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `public/index.php/admin/nav/add.html` endpoint in NoneCMS v1.3 lacks CSRF protection. Specifically, the `add` function in `application\admin\controller\Nav.php` does not validate a CSRF token.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The application does not implement CSRF protection on the `public/index.php/admin/nav/add.html` endpoint. This allows an attacker to forge a request to add a navigation item.
- **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The `name` parameter in the navigation item creation is not sanitized, which allows injection of arbitrary web script or HTML. This results in stored XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can add malicious navigation items to the admin panel by crafting a malicious HTML page that forges a request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- This leads to stored XSS, meaning that whenever an administrator or user accesses the affected navigation area, the injected script will execute in their browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious web page (e.g., via phishing, malicious link) while they have an active session in NoneCMS.
- The attacker-controlled webpage will contain a form that automatically submits a forged POST request to the `public/index.php/admin/nav/add.html` endpoint containing the attacker's payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require prior authentication or access to the NoneCMS system.
- The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver a malicious webpage to a logged-in administrator of NoneCMS.
- The attacker must know the target system's URL, including the vulnerable endpoint and parameters.
