Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23560:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A user-mode write access violation occurs within the IrfanView software when processing a crafted DCR file. This is due to an issue in how the software handles data within the DCR file format.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- User-mode write access violation. The software attempts to write data to a memory location that it should not have access to, leading to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a user-mode write access violation, which will likely crash the application. While the information provided does not explicitly state a possibility for remote code execution, the crash itself is a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted DCR file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must be able to provide a user with a specially crafted DCR file. The user would then need to open this file using the vulnerable version of IrfanView to trigger the issue. This vulnerability is exploitable locally by the user opening the crafted file.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs at `FORMATS!ShowPlugInSaveOptions_W+0x000000000001bcab`.
- The specific instruction causing the fault is `mov word ptr [esi+edi*2],ax`.
- The memory location being written to is `ds:002b:4642d000`, and it is an invalid memory location.
- The issue is located in the "Formats.dll" plugin, version 4.55.4 when processing a DCR file.
- The vulnerability is triggered when calling `ShowPlugInSaveOptions_W`

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided information suggests that the vendor has fixed the error in a later version of the plugin, and users should update to the latest versions.
- There are many similar vulnerabilities described in the github page. The majority of them related to "user-mode write access violations" in the "Formats.dll" plugin when opening specific image file types with older versions of IrfanView.
