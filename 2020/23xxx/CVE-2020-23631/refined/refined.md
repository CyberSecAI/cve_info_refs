Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-23631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaw and a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the wdja application. The CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to trick an authenticated user into performing unwanted actions, while the XSS allows them to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to create a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated user, submits a crafted request to the vulnerable application.
2. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied data that is later output on a page. Specifically, the 'tongji' parameter (likely related to analytics or statistics) in the global configuration settings is vulnerable to stored XSS. This allows an attacker to inject JavaScript code that will be executed in the browser of any user who views the admin page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can leverage the CSRF vulnerability to modify the global configuration settings of the application, specifically injecting malicious JavaScript code into the "tongji" (statistics) field. The impact is that this JavaScript will be executed in the context of the browser of anyone viewing the affected admin page, enabling the attacker to potentially:

*   Steal session cookies.
*   Redirect users to malicious websites.
*   Perform actions on behalf of the authenticated user.
*   Deface the webpage

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **CSRF Attack:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that sends a POST request to the vulnerable application's configuration page.
2.  **XSS Injection:** The malicious script is injected via the "tongji" field within the crafted POST request. The application then stores this script in the database and later executes it when the admin page is visited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user (typically an administrator) into visiting the malicious HTML page containing the CSRF attack. This could be done through various social engineering techniques like sending a link via email or other messaging platforms.
2.  The attacker does not need direct access to the application, the vulnerability can be exploited through an indirect attack vector.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided exploit code shows an example of a successful CSRF attack injecting an XSS payload into the ‘tongji’ field.
*   The 'tongji' field is used for inputting statistics or tracking code, which is typically not sanitized.
*   The provided content gives a good overview of how the combined attack would work, this information is not present in the official CVE description.
