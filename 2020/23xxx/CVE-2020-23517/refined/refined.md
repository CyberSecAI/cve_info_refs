- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input sanitization of the "uid" parameter in the "LoginForm" table.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious code that will be executed in the victim's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the "uid" parameter in a GET request. This injected code is then reflected back in the response, causing the browser to execute it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious GET request to the vulnerable application and entice a user to click the manipulated link.
