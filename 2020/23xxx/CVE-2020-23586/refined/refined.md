The provided content relates to CVE-2020-23586.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of sufficient Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the `/net_qos_cls_edit.asp` endpoint of the OPTILINK E-PON "MODEL NO: OP-XT71000N" device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF:** The web application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Lack of authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated, remote attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can add arbitrary Network Traffic Control Type Rules by exploiting the CSRF vulnerability. This could lead to denial of service or other malicious actions by controlling network traffic.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted request to `/net_qos_cls_edit.asp` endpoint. This request is made by the attacker but executed by the victim's browser while the victim is authenticated to the vulnerable OPTILINK E-PON device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a victim to visit a malicious page (or execute a malicious script) while the victim is logged into the vulnerable device. The attacker does not need direct access to the device's network.
