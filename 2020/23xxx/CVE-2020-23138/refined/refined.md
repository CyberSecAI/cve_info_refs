The provided content describes a vulnerability in Microweber version 1.1.18, specifically related to unrestricted file uploads. This aligns with the general class of vulnerabilities described by CVE-2020-23138, although it lacks the official CVE description for direct confirmation.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability based on the provided text:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application lacks proper validation of file extensions during profile image uploads on the admin account page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted File Upload: The application allows uploading files with arbitrary extensions, bypassing security checks.
- Lack of Input Validation: There's no validation on the file extension. The application relies on the `image/jpeg` content type instead, which can be easily spoofed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts, executable files) to the server.
- Drive-by-download attacks: An attacker could upload files that trigger downloads onto the machines of users who visit the website.
- Website Defacement: Malicious uploads can deface the website by injecting custom content.
- Web shell access: An attacker can gain access to the server's file system by uploading a web shell.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the "Admin Account Profile Page" of the Microweber application.
- The specific attack vector is the file upload functionality on the profile page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the admin account of the Microweber application.
- The attacker must be able to access the profile page and perform file uploads.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious file with an arbitrary extension and a spoofed `image/jpeg` content-type, and upload it via the application's profile image upload functionality.

The content from both gists discusses the same vulnerability but provides slightly different wording, they both are related to the lack of extension validation in the Microweber image upload functionality.
