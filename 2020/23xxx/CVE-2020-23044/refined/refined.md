{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in the web page, resulting in injection of malicious code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in various files due to insufficient input sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, redirects to malicious sites, and manipulation of application modules.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vectors involve injecting malicious script code through specific parameters in vulnerable files. The parameters are `activepath`, `keyword`, `tag`, `fmdo=x&filename`, `CKEditor`, and `CKEditorFuncNum`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a privileged user account and can exploit the vulnerabilities remotely through POST and GET requests with low user interaction."
