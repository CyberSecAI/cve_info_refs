**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker can add an administrative user to the GetSimple CMS instance. This would allow the attacker to gain full control of the CMS.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted HTML page containing a form that sends a POST request to the vulnerable server, tricking an authenticated administrator to add a new admin user by visiting this third-party site.
