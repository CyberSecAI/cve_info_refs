Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23226:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output escaping in multiple files of the Cacti application. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the application's user interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- Insufficient input validation, and output escaping in various parts of the application

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution in the context of the user's browser
- Information disclosure, potentially allowing an attacker to steal sensitive data or perform actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- Injecting malicious JavaScript into various input fields, such as:
  - Report text items
  - Data query names
  - Data input/output fields
  - Graph item colors
  - Site/device/tree names and descriptions
  - Graph template names
  - Report names

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Requires an attacker to have a Cacti user account with the ability to create or modify certain settings/data
-  Successful exploitation requires an administrator or user to visit the affected pages, triggering the injected XSS payload.
- In some cases no authentication is required (e.g. in CVE-2022-46169)

**Additional Details:**

- The provided github issue #3549 outlines several specific XSS attack scenarios. It includes several cases demonstrating the vulnerability.
- Debian LTS advisory DLA-2965-1 and DLA-3252-1 mentions that CVE-2020-23226 is related to multiple XSS vulnerabilities in multiple files of the Cacti application.
