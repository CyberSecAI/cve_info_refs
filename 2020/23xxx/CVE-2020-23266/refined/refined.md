The provided content relates to CVE-2020-23266.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `OD_ReadUTF8String()` function within `odf_code.c`. This occurs when reading a UTF-8 string from a media file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in `OD_ReadUTF8String()`.
- The `strlen` function is used after an allocation, and the data provided by the file may cause a read out of bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The application crashes due to the heap-based buffer overflow.
- Potential Information Exposure: The vulnerability could potentially leak sensitive information stored in adjacent memory regions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious media file: An attacker can craft a malicious media file containing a specifically crafted UTF-8 string, which triggers the buffer overflow when processed by the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious media file to the vulnerable application, `MP4Box`.
- The attacker does not need any other elevated access within the system.

**Additional details:**
- The issue is triggered during the processing of a file using `MP4Box`, which is part of the GPAC framework.
- The ASAN report provides a detailed stack trace of the overflow.
- The vulnerability was found in GPAC version 0.8.0-e10d39d-master.
- The specific location of the overflow is pinpointed to the `strlen()` call within the `OD_SizeUTF8String()` function, called by `OD_ReadUTF8String()`, while attempting to determine the size of the string after it has been read. The size calculation based on the potentially crafted malformed string seems to be the cause of the overflow, rather than the reading of the string itself.
