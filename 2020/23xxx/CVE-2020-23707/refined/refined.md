Based on the provided information, this content is related to the CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists within the `ok_jpg_decode_block_progressive` function, specifically at `ok_jpg.c:1054`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow. This means that the program is writing data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially leading to memory corruption or unexpected behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to various impacts, including:
*   Program crash
*   Potential arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overwritten data.
*   Denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted JPEG file. The vulnerability is triggered when the `ok_jpg_decode_block_progressive` function is called while processing a crafted JPEG file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious JPEG file to the vulnerable application. The vulnerable application needs to attempt to process the malicious file, using the `ok-file-formats` library.

**Additional details:**
* The ASan report provides detailed information about the memory corruption, including the location of the overflow, the size of the write, and the allocation details.
* A proof of concept (PoC) file that triggers the vulnerability is also provided.
* The issue was found using the AFL fuzzer.
