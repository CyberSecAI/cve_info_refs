The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in AVideo, specifically versions prior to 8.9, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Vulnerabilities and their root cause:**

1.  **Privilege Escalation via Configuration File Deletion:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `objects/import.json.php` script allows users with upload permissions to delete arbitrary files, including the crucial configuration file (`videos/configuration.php`), by manipulating the `fileURI` parameter. The vulnerability lies in the usage of `unlink()` function without proper validation of the file path.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure file deletion logic within the `import.json.php` script.
    *   **Impact:** Deleting the configuration file resets the application, requiring a new setup. This allows a low-privileged user to disrupt the application and force a reinstallation. It can also be used in conjunction with the next vulnerability to gain admin access by creating a new configuration, or if admin access is disabled, this gives an avenue to regain it.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `objects/import.json.php` with a `delete` parameter and a manipulated `fileURI` pointing to the configuration file.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** A user account with upload permission, and the `doNotShowImportMP4Button` setting disabled.

2.  **File Inclusion Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `plugin/LiveLinks/proxy.php` script uses `url_get_contents()` on a user-controlled URL via the `livelink` GET parameter, without proper validation. This leads to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
    *   **Weakness:** Unsafe usage of `url_get_contents()` allows reading arbitrary files from the server's file system.
    *  **Impact:** An attacker can read sensitive files like `configuration.php`, which contains database credentials.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Sending a GET request to `plugin/LiveLinks/proxy.php` with a `livelink` parameter set to a file URI such as `file:///C:/xampp/htdocs/AVideo/videos/configuration.php` (example path).
    *   **Required Capabilities:** No authentication required, any user, even unauthenticated users, can exploit this vulnerability.

3.  **Remote Code Execution via Configuration Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `install/checkConfiguration.php` script allows injecting arbitrary PHP code into the `configuration.php` file through the `salt` parameter, which is not properly sanitized.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper sanitization when writing user-supplied data into the configuration file.
    *   **Impact:** By injecting malicious code into the configuration file, an attacker can gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `install/checkConfiguration.php` with a malicious `salt` parameter, containing PHP code.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send POST requests after the configuration file has been deleted.

**Chained Exploitation:**

The provided content also describes how to chain these vulnerabilities together to achieve full compromise of the system:

1.  A user with upload permissions and `doNotShowImportMP4Button` disabled, or an admin user with disabled dangerous functions can use the first vulnerability to delete the `configuration.php` file.
2.  The attacker exploits the file inclusion vulnerability to read the database credentials from `configuration.php` using the second vulnerability.
3.  The attacker exploits the third vulnerability to inject malicious PHP code into `configuration.php` and achieve remote code execution.

The content also provides a Go exploit that automates the entire process, demonstrating the severity of the vulnerability chain.
