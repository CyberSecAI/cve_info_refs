- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `name` and `comment` parameters within the `AddEvent.php` file. This unsanitized input is then stored and later displayed in the logs (Log Management), allowing for the injection of malicious script code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The injected script persists in the application's database and is executed when the log entries are viewed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious sources, and persistent manipulation of application modules. This could result in unauthorized access, data theft, and further compromise of the application and its users.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can inject malicious script code through the `name` and `comment` parameters in `AddEvent.php` via a POST request. The injected code is then triggered when the log is viewed in the admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need a low-privileged web application user account to inject the malicious payload. No special privileges or high user interaction is required.
