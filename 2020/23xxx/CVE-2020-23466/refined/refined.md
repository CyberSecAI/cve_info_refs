Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-23466 (though the exploit-db entry states N/A, the provided information aligns with the typical characteristics of this CVE)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Online Marriage Registration System lacks proper input sanitization when processing user-submitted data. Specifically, the application does not filter or encode data before storing it in the database. This lack of filtering allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored/persistent XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected through several input fields, which are then stored in the database. When this data is retrieved and displayed, the injected scripts execute in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of users who access the affected pages.
- **Session hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal user cookies and session information
- **Data theft:** The attacker can use JavaScript to potentially steal sensitive information.
- **Website defacement:** The attacker can modify the displayed content of the site
- **Phishing attacks:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Form Submission:** The attacker injects malicious scripts into form fields during the marriage registration process. Specifically mentioned vulnerable parameters are:
  - `$nofhusband`
  - `$hreligion`
  - `$haddress`
  - `$hstate`
  - `$nofwife`
  - `$wreligion`
  - `$waddress`
  - `$wstate`
  - `$witnessnamef`
  - `$waddressfirst`
  - `$witnessnames`
  - `$waddresssec`
  - `$witnessnamet`
  - `$waddressthird`
  - The vulnerability exists because the application directly uses user inputs from these fields in database queries without sanitization or encoding, which are then displayed to the users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the online marriage registration form to submit the malicious input. This could be a user of the system, or potentially a malicious actor exploiting a lack of input validation.
- **Technical Skills:** The attacker requires knowledge of HTML and JavaScript to craft effective XSS payloads.
