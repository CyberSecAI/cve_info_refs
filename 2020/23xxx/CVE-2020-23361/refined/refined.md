The provided content is related to CVE-2020-23361.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of loose comparison operators (`==`) instead of strict comparison operators (`===`) in PHP code. Specifically, this occurs during authentication checks and password rechecking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Authentication bypass:** The use of `==` allows for type juggling, which enables attackers to bypass authentication by providing specially crafted strings that evaluate to true due to PHP's loose comparison rules. For example, a password string like "0" can be equal to a hash such as "0e123456789"
*  **Password recheck bypass:** The use of `!=` allows for type juggling. The same weakness also exists in password rechecking, where different strings like "0e11" and "0e22" may be considered equal.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Data manipulation:** Once authenticated, attackers can potentially manipulate data, add/remove users, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST requests:** Attackers can send crafted POST requests with specific email and password values designed to exploit the loose comparison vulnerability.
*   **Password reset/change:** Attackers can potentially bypass the password rechecking mechanism during password reset/change, allowing them to set a password to a value that allows them to bypass the authentication with weak comparison.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameters (e.g., email and password) used in the authentication check.
*   **Basic understanding of type juggling:** Knowledge of PHP's type juggling behaviors is helpful to craft the exploit.
