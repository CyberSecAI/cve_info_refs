Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1. Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation in the `createFolder` module of the Sky File v2.1.0 iOS web application.
*   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a folder, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script code into the folder path.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject persistent malicious scripts that execute when a user interacts with the compromised folder or the web application. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Persistent phishing attacks
    *   Persistent external redirects
    *   Manipulation of the web context within the affected device
*   **Attack Vector:**  Remote attackers with access to the application's web UI via Wi-Fi can inject malicious script code into the 'createFolder' module using a POST request.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network as the device running the vulnerable application and have a basic understanding of web requests.

**2. Directory Traversal Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** Insecure access permissions and path validation within the local FTP server configuration of the Sky File v2.1.0 iOS web application.
*   **Weakness:** The application's FTP server allows an anonymous user to manipulate the directory path using `CWD` and `CDUP` commands, combined with a `/null//` path, to navigate outside the intended application folder and access the root file system.
*  **Impact:** This allows an attacker to gain unauthorized file system access and leads to information disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive application data.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote attackers on the same Wi-Fi network can connect to the application's FTP server with anonymous credentials and exploit the path traversal vulnerability by sending crafted FTP commands.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network as the device running the vulnerable application and have a basic understanding of FTP commands.
