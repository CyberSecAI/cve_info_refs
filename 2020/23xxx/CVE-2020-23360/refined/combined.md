## Description

![@peng-hui](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35496882?u=6d594d7d667c54e02d74ce8f0a7b377349e9f69d&v=4&size=48)[peng-hui](https://github.com/peng-hui)opened [on May 26, 2020](https://github.com/osCommerce/oscommerce2/issues/658#issue-624620472)

Hi,

I just find that, in many places of oscommerce v2.3.4.1, the username and password recheck during registration and other processes can be bypassed easily through the `magic string` in loose comparison, for example `"0e11111" == "0e22222"` returns `Bool(True)`. If the user sets the username or password to such magic strings, the recheck process using loose comparison (==) does not work at all.
