- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization when adding a new field definition in the News module settings. Specifically, the system does not encode HTML elements of tags, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This could potentially lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to access the admin panel of CMS Made Simple, navigate to the News module settings, and then the "Field Definitions" section. They can then inject the XSS payload via the "add Field Definition" functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs administrative privileges to access the News module settings within the CMS Made Simple admin panel.
