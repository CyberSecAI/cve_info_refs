- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when managing administrator information. Specifically, it does not HTML entity encode the output.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application attempts to remove script tags which is insufficient to prevent XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of other users who view the affected pages, potentially leading to private data exposure, redirection to malicious websites, or other malicious operations.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious scripts into the "Manage administrators" feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an authenticated session with administrator privileges to access the vulnerable page and edit the admin's information.
