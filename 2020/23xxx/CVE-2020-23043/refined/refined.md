- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly validate file extensions during upload, allowing attackers to bypass the web server's configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to insufficient file extension validation in the `upload` POST method. The application allows for multiple file extensions (e.g. `html.js.png`), and after upload, the attacker can request the file and execute it by removing the unwanted extension.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows attackers to upload and execute malicious code on the mobile device, leading to potential application or device compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP POST requests to the `/upload` endpoint, with a manipulated filename containing multiple extensions, followed by a GET request to the uploaded file to execute it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local network access to reach the vulnerable service and must be able to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/upload` endpoint. No authentication is required.
