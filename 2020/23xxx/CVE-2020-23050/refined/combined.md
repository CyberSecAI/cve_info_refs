1.1
A html injection web vulnerability has been discovered in the TAO Open Source Assessment Platform v3.3.0 RC02 web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious html codes with persistent attack vector to compromise browser
to web-application requests from the application-side.
The html inject web vulnerability is located in the `userFirstName`, `userLastName`, `userMail`, `password2`, and `password3`
parameters of the user account input field. The request method to inject is POST and the attack vector is application-side.
Remote attackers are able to inject html code for the user account credentials to provoke an execution within the main manage
user listing.
Successful exploitation of the web vulnerability results in persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious
source and persistent manipulation of affected application modules.
Request Method(s):
[+] POST
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Manage Users
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] userFirstName
[+] userLastName
[+] userMail
[+] password2
[+] password3
1.2
Multiple persistent cross site web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the TAO Open Source Assessment Platform v3.3.0 RC02.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to compromise browser to
web-application requests from the application-side.
The persistent vulnerability is located in the content parameter of the Rubric Block (Add) module. Attackers are able to inject own malicious
script code inside of the rubric name value. The attached values will be redisplayed in the frontend of tao. The request method to inject is
POST and the attack vector is located on the application-side. The injection point is the Rubric Block (Add) module and the execution occurs
in the frontend panel when listing the item attribute.
Successful exploitation of the web vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects
to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected or connected application modules.
Request Method(s):
[+] POST
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Rubric Block (Add)
Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] content
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
1.1
The persistent html injection web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security web vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Install the application and open the ui
2. Move on top right to the user button and click manage users
3. Inject html script code payload into the vulnerable input fields
4. Save the entry
5. Open to the manage users listing
Note: The payloads executes in the table that shows the user account values for admins
6. Successful reproduce of the html inject vulnerability!
