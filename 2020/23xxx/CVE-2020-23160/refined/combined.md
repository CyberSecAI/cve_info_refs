# Pyrescom-Termod-PoC

This is the Proof-of-concept exploit code for three vulnerabilities discovered by Jonas Mattsson and Hugo van den Toorn at [Outpost24](https://outpost24.com/) Ghost Labs. These vulnerabilities are discovered in the web server component on a [Pyrescom Termod4](https://pyres.com/en/solutions/termod-4/) time control machine. These vulnerabilities can be chained and allow a remote attacker to bypass authentication, read files from the local filesystem and execute arbitrary commands. The following CVE IDs can be used to reference to these vulnerabilities: CVE-2020-23160, CVE-2020-23161 and CVE-2020-23162.

[![](/Outpost24/Pyrescom-Termod-PoC/raw/main/img.png)](/Outpost24/Pyrescom-Termod-PoC/blob/main/img.png)

# CVE Details

These vulnerabilities are identified by three CVE IDs, described below.

## CVE-2020-23160 - Remote code execution

Remote code execution in Pyrescom Termod4 time management devices before 10.04k allows authenticated remote attackers to arbitrary commands as root on the devices. [See MITRE CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-23160)

## CVE-2020-23161 - Local file inclusion

Local file inclusion in Pyrescom Termod4 time management devices before 10.04k allows authenticated remote attackers to traverse directories and read sensitive files via the Maintenance > Logs menu and manipulating the file-path in the URL. [See MITRE CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-23161)

## CVE-2020-23162 - Sensitive information disclosure & weak encryption

Sensitive information disclosure and weak encryption in Pyrescom Termod4 time management devices before 10.04k allows remote attackers to read a session-file and obtain plain-text user credentials. [See MITRE CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-23162)

# Proof-of-Concept

Chained attack against Termod4 devices, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to:

* Obtain plain credentials by reading and decrypting exposed session information (CVE-2020-23161 & CVE-2020-23162).
* Perform remote code execution (RCE) as root (CVE-2020-23161).
* Take screenshots of the active device's current physical screen (potential eavesdropping on user-interaction on physical device, untested).

## Installation

Clone this repository, (optionally) setup a Python virtual environment and install dependencies. Assuming you have Python3 and python3-venv installed (`apt-get install python3-venv`).

0. (optional) Setup virtualenv called 'Pyrescom-CVE': `python3 -m venv Pyrescom-CVE`, change dir `cd Pyrescom-CVE` and activate it `. bin/activate`.
1. Clone the repository into the current directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/Outpost24/Pyrescom-Termod-PoC.git .
```

2. Install dependencies with Python-pip:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. You should now be able to the actual script:

```
python Pyrescom-poc.py
```

## Usage

Basic usage of this PoC is as follows:

* Basic usage, obtains plain credentials: `python Pyrescom-poc.py http://<target-URI or IP>`
* Take screenshot of webserver interface `python Pyrescom-poc.py http://<target-URI or IP> -s`
* Execute command `python Pyrescom-poc.py http://<target-URI or IP> <command>`
* Help `python Pyrescom-poc.py -h`

# **The reference badge reader**

Managing time and attendance is a problem for many companies. Today, time recorders are still the preferred option for French companies to record their employees’ working hours.

## Termod’s **strengths**



### Recognized quality

Our Termod range of badging machines has been around for over 30 years and has evolved over the years to meet the needs of companies. Some of our customers are still using the first version of our badge machines!



### A 100% French company

Our customer service department, like all our departments from design to production, is located in France, more precisely in the Pyrénées-Orientales region.



### A market benchmark

Termod badge readers are offered by the majority of HRIS, payroll and ATM software publishers on the market, and integrated into software package or outsourced (Cloud/SAAS) environments.



### A sustainable range

PYRESCOM is constantly striving to reduce its environmental impact, from design to recycling. We are committed to repairing our badges to guarantee long-term reliability.



### Confirmed safety

The connection and data transmitted by our badge readers use a proven, mastered technical chain that enables us to guarantee data availability, integrity and confidentiality.



### Suitable for all badges

All secure RFID badge reader technologies are integrated into our badge readers, enabling you to pool your investments: badges, encoding, choice of reader…

## Why use**Termod** system?

Termod’s physical badge readers record entries, exits and breaks, as well as departures on assignment or training… They also record the time spent on each activity.

Employees can consult their time counters, schedules and vacation requests directly on the time clock.

![](data:image/svg+xml... "2310 - EPnrj - News")![](https://2024.pyres.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2310-EPnrj-Nouveautes.png "2310 - EPnrj - News")

## Our Termod **range**

### Standard

Termod Standard records employees’ working and attendance times. It also enables them to consult their personal data and enter requests (missions, leave, events, etc.).

[Download the brochure](https://2024.pyres.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2401_Termod_T4_EN.pdf)

### Tactile

Termod Tactile combines the functionalities of the Standard version with the advantages of a touch screen, making it easier to enter information on the terminal (vacation requests, data consultation, etc.).

[Download the brochure](https://2024.pyres.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2401_Termod_T4_EN.pdf)

![](data:image/svg+xml... "Untitled design")![](https://2024.pyres.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Design-sans-titre.jpg "Untitled design")

## **e-Axes** software

e-Axe’s provides secure access to buildings, rooms, parking lots and turnstiles. People can be identified by badges, and the interface tools supplied enable access rules and authorizations to be set.

e-Axes takes into account all aspects of access control: centralized management (multisite, supervision…), authorizations (user profiles, access rules…), access points (remote opening, badge compatibility…) and history (alerts and notifications, traceability…).

## When will we see **biometric** time clocks?

Biometric data is personal data that makes it possible to identify a person: fingerprints, DNA… Since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018, biometric badges have been banned in France.

Although our Termod badge readers can read biometric data (notably via facial recognition), these options are not available in France.
