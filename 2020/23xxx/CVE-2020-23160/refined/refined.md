Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2020-23160:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a vulnerability in the web server component of the Pyrescom Termod4 time control machine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (CVE-2020-23160):**  Authenticated remote attackers can execute arbitrary commands as root on the affected devices. This vulnerability is the primary focus of CVE-2020-23160.
*   **Local File Inclusion (CVE-2020-23161):** Authenticated attackers can traverse directories and read sensitive files by manipulating the file path in the URL via the Maintenance > Logs menu.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure & Weak Encryption (CVE-2020-23162):**  Attackers can read session files and obtain plaintext user credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** Attackers can gain root-level access to the Pyrescom Termod4 device.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can read sensitive files and obtain user credentials which can be used for further unauthorized access.
*   **Potential Eavesdropping:** Attackers can take screenshots of the device's screen, potentially observing user interactions.
*  **Chained Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be chained by an unauthenticated attacker to gain full access and control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerabilities are exploitable through the device's web server, making it accessible to remote attackers on the network.
*   **HTTP requests:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server component of the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the Pyrescom Termod4 device.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The provided proof-of-concept allows an unauthenticated attacker to exploit the vulnerabilities through chaining the exploits.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Pyrescom Termod4 time management devices before version 10.04k.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is available, demonstrating how to chain these vulnerabilities to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution and credential theft.
*   The vendor was initially contacted in December 2019, and a fix was released in March 2020. However, the vendor did not respond to proposed disclosure timelines, and CVEs were only assigned in January 2021.
