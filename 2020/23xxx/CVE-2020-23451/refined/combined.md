![quotes-1-a image](https://images.spiceworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/19074633/quotes-1-a.png) The Spiceworks Community is the best technical resource on the Internet. By asking nicely you can get help from IT consultants which would cost you hundreds of dollars per hour if you had to pay for it. Everyone gives back what knowledge they can for mutual benefit all around.

![quotes-1-a image](https://images.spiceworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/19074633/quotes-1-a.png) I’m still early into my IT career and I ask question a lot about stuff I don’t know. Rather then being shamed or ignored, I get helpful people reaching out looking to help in any way they can to help me get to a conclusion.

![quotes-1-a image](https://images.spiceworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/19074633/quotes-1-a.png) Through Spiceworks, I have been able to gain important IT knowledge, get out of tight IT situations, and assist many other to do the same. I have made many vendor purchases, received vendor assistance, and got some pretty sweet vendor deals.
