The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the MCMS (MingSoft Content Management System).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `queryIdsByCategoryIdForParser` method within `IContentDao.xml`, specifically the insecure handling of the `orderBy` parameter. This parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization.
- The `MCmsAction.java` controller does not sanitize the `orderby` parameter before passing it to the vulnerable method in the dao.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization of the `orderBy` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Stacked SQL Injection:**  If the MySQL configuration has `allowMultiQueries` set to true (as it is in the provided `application-dev.yml`), an attacker can execute multiple SQL statements in one request, compounding the impact of the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database by constructing SQL queries to reveal database schema or records.
- **Data Modification:** With stacked SQL injection, an attacker can modify the database, including potentially creating admin accounts.
- **Denial of Service:** Through time-based blind SQL injection using functions like `sleep()`, an attacker can cause delays in server response.
- **Complete Takeover:** In the provided example, the attacker injects a new admin account, potentially granting complete control of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is carried out through a crafted GET request to `/mcms/view.do`.
- The attacker needs to manipulate the `id`, `orderby`, and `order` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable MCMS application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint `/mcms/view.do`.
- The attacker requires knowledge of the application's parameter structure.

The provided content gives more detail than the typical CVE description by including:
- The exact vulnerable code in `IContentDao.xml`.
- The vulnerable code in `MCmsAction.java`.
- Specific examples of how to exploit the SQL injection, including a time-based blind injection and a stacked injection to create an admin account.
- Steps on how to enumerate valid id's
- Configuration details (`application-dev.yml`) highlighting the `allowMultiQueries` setting that enables stacked SQL injection.
