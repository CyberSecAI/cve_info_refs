Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23545:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `FORMATS.dll` plugin of IrfanView when processing XPM files. Specifically, it's a user-mode write access violation occurring at the memory address `FORMATS!ReadXPM_W+0x0000000000000531`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **User Mode Write Access Violation:** The program attempts to write data to a memory location that it is not authorized to access, resulting in an access violation. This happens during the parsing of a crafted XPM file.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper validation for the XPM file format, leading to a situation where a crafted file can trigger the write access violation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User-mode write access violation:**  This leads to a crash of the application. The provided content does not provide enough information to assess if further impact is possible such as code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack Vector:** The attacker must have the victim open a malicious XPM file using IrfanView. This requires local access, as the user has to open the file directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide or convince the victim to open a specially crafted XPM file using the vulnerable version of IrfanView. This does not require any privileged access.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vendor has addressed this issue by fixing the error in the plugin. Users are advised to update their IrfanView plugins to the latest version to mitigate the risk.
- The specific memory location where the write access violation occurs is provided: `FORMATS!ReadXPM_W+0x531: 10003991 880429 mov byte ptr [ecx+ebp],al ds:002b:0f7ff000=??`
