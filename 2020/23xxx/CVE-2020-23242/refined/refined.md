```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'Tools' feature, specifically when creating or editing web users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to the attacker gaining access to private data such as cookies or session information. It can also redirect the victim to malicious websites and allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker inputs a malicious payload through the 'name' field in the 'Tools' feature while creating or editing a web user.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated user of the application with the ability to access the 'Tools' feature. No specific privileges are mentioned, but it's implied to be at least a user with administrative capabilities."
