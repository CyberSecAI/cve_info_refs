Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `abst_box_read` function within the `box_code_adobe.c` file of the GPAC library. The vulnerability occurs due to an incorrect calculation of the size of a string being read from a file, which then leads to memory corruption when `strdup` is called.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The `abst_box_read` function allocates memory using `gf_malloc` based on the box size. However, in the original code, `tmp_strsize` was calculated incorrectly, subtracting 8 bytes, causing an undersized allocation. Then, when `strdup` was called (within the same function or a subsequent call in the stacktrace) to duplicate this data, it would read beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
    - Specifically, the issues occur at:
        - `box_code_adobe.c:124`: When `strdup` tries to read 5 bytes from the heap-allocated memory (which only has 4 bytes available), resulting in a heap-buffer-overflow.
        - `box_code_adobe.c:141`: When `strdup` tries to read 20 bytes from the heap-allocated memory (which only has 19 bytes available), also resulting in a heap-buffer-overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Memory corruption:** The heap-buffer-overflow corrupts memory on the heap, potentially overwriting adjacent data structures.
-   **Application crash:** The AddressSanitizer output shows that the program aborts due to the overflow, resulting in a denial-of-service.
-   **Potential arbitrary code execution:** While not explicitly stated, this type of vulnerability could, in some situations, be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution if an attacker can precisely control the overflow and the overwritten data.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious MP4 file:** An attacker could craft a malicious MP4 file with specific box structures that trigger the vulnerability during parsing.
-   **MP4Box tool:** The provided command-line example indicates that the `MP4Box` tool is vulnerable when processing such a crafted MP4 file. Specifically: `./bin/gcc/MP4Box -diso -out /dev/null @@` is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **File creation/modification:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify an MP4 file.
-   **MP4Box execution:** The attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable MP4Box application to process this crafted file.

**Additional Details:**

-   The issue was identified by `seviezhou`.
-   The vulnerability is present in the `abst_box_read` function, specifically at `box_code_adobe.c:124` and `box_code_adobe.c:141`.
-   A proof-of-concept (POC) file is provided in two zip archives: `heap-overflow-abst_box_read-box_code_adobe-124.zip` and `heap-overflow-abst_box_read-box_code_adobe-141.zip`, triggering the heap-buffer-overflow.
-   The vulnerability was fixed in commit `8e05648d6b4459facbc783025c5c42d301fef5c3`, where the `tmp_strsize` calculation was corrected. The fix in the commit modifies `tmp_strsize =(u32)ptr->size-8;` to `tmp_strsize =(u32)ptr->size;`
-   The vulnerability was reported as issues #1568 and #1569.
