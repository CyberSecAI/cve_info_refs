Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of a vulnerable version of UEditor (1.4.3.3) in YzmCMS 5.6. This version of UEditor doesn't properly sanitize or filter the `src` attribute of `iframe` elements, allowing for the injection of JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS through the `src` attribute of an `iframe` element.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization/Filtering:** The application fails to properly filter or sanitize user-supplied input, specifically within the UEditor component. Script tags are filtered, but iframe tags are not.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser, leading to various potential impacts.
- **Cookie theft:** The provided PoC demonstrates the ability to steal user cookies.
- **Session hijacking:** Stolen cookies can be used to hijack user sessions.
- **Defacement/Modification:** The attacker may alter the displayed content on affected pages.
- **Redirects:** An attacker may redirect a user to a malicious site.
- **Other client-side attacks:** The injected JavaScript could be used for further malicious activities like keylogging, phishing etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- **User input:** The vulnerability is triggered by malicious input within the `src` attribute of an `iframe` element within an article editing page of the CMS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to edit articles in YzmCMS. This likely requires some level of privileged access within the CMS.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable input point:** The attacker needs to be aware that the `src` attribute of an `iframe` element is vulnerable to XSS.

**Additional Information:**
