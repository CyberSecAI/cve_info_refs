- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the navigation title, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the meta properties. Specifically, the navigation title field was vulnerable to Javascript injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities. The vulnerability was present both in the frontend and the backend.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious Javascript code into the navigation title, an attacker can exploit the XSS vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need the ability to modify the navigation title, likely through the application's administrative interface or an injection point.
