Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-23936:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the login mechanism of the Vehicle Parking Management System version 1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `username` parameter in the login form. The provided exploit demonstrates how to bypass authentication by injecting a single quote `'` and a comment `#` into the username field (`username=admin'#`). This closes the intended SQL query and comments out the remaining part, effectively bypassing the password check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass the login authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the application's administrative interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `index.php` page of the application, targeting the login form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server where the vulnerable application is hosted.
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must understand basic SQL injection principles to craft the malicious payload.
*   **Knowledge of Application URL:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the application's login page (`http://(HOST)/index.php`).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit targets the `username` parameter and uses the `'#` characters to terminate and comment out the rest of the query.
*   The default credentials "admin:Test@123" are also mentioned in the exploit information as a possible, but not required, method for login.
*   The affected application is the "Vehicle Parking Management System 1.0" from phpgurukul.com.
*   The exploit has been tested on Windows and WampServer.
