- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `swfupload.swf` file in NoneCMS allows user-controlled input via the `movieName` parameter to be concatenated into the `flashReady_Callback` variable, which is then passed as an argument to `ExternalCall.Simple()`. The `ExternalCall.Simple()` function directly executes this parameter, leading to a Flash XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Flash XSS. The application fails to sanitize user-provided input in the `movieName` parameter, which is then used in a context that executes code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session by crafting a malicious URL, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted URL to the vulnerable `swfupload.swf` file. The attacker needs to convince a user (in this case the NoneCMS administrator) to visit a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious URL and get a user to click on that link. No specific privileges on the NoneCMS instance are needed. The attack is client-side and is successful if the victim has flash enabled.
