The provided content discusses a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Snippets module of Monstra CMS version 3.0.4.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to insert arbitrary PHP code via the Snippets module. This is due to insufficient input validation or sanitization when editing snippets, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload/Code Injection:**  The Snippets module allows users to input PHP code without proper sanitization, leading to code injection.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The CMS doesn't adequately validate the content of snippets, permitting the insertion of malicious PHP code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting and executing arbitrary PHP code, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server. This allows the attacker to perform malicious actions, such as compromising the entire web server, accessing sensitive data, or manipulating the website and its content.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** An attacker can exploit this by logging into the Monstra CMS admin panel and navigating to the Snippets module. They then edit a snippet, insert malicious PHP code, and save it. Upon viewing the page where the snippet is used, the injected code is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have valid administrative credentials to log into the Monstra CMS admin panel.
