- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize the `path` parameter in the `list` and `download` modules, allowing directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability. The application doesn't properly validate the path parameter, allowing attackers to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the file system of the mobile device, potentially leading to information disclosure (e.g., environment variables and sensitive system paths) and mobile application compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted HTTP requests containing directory traversal sequences in the `path` parameter of the `list` and `download` endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable device, with access to the wifi interface. No user interaction or authentication is required.
