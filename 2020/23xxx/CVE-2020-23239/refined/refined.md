{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'Menu Preferences' feature, specifically in the 'Fields name' field.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to the transmission of private data like cookies, redirection to attacker-controlled websites, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user and inject the malicious payload into the 'Fields name' field within the 'Menu Preferences' section of the application.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the admin interface."
