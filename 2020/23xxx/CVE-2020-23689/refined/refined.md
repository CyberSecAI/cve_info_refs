  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying comments, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored XSS vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through a comment, which will be executed in the browsers of other users viewing the comment, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a comment field on the news page of the application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to leave comments on the news page of the application. This may require having an account and being logged in. The attacker also needs to know the URL of a news page with comments enabled."
