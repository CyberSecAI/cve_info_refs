##### **3a. PATH configuration privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2020-3980)**

**Description**

VMware Fusion contains a privilege escalation vulnerability due to the way it allows configuring the system wide path. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Moderate severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [6.7](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Known Attack Vectors**

An attacker with normal user privileges may exploit this issue to trick an admin user into executing malicious code on the system where Fusion is installed.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2020-3980 apply the patches listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' found below.

**Workarounds**

None.

**Additional Documentation**

None.

**Acknowledgements**

VMware would like to thank Rich Mirch from TeamARES of Critical Start for reporting this issue to us.

##### **3b. Multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities via Cortado ThinPrint (CVE-2020-3986, CVE-2020-3987, CVE-2020-3988)**

**Description**

VMware Workstation and Horizon Client for Windows contain multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in Cortado ThinPrint component. These issues exist in the EMF and JPEG2000 parsers. VMware has evaluated the severity of these issues to be in the [Moderate severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [5.2](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L).

**Known Attack Vectors**

A malicious actor with normal access to a virtual machine may be able to exploit these issues to create a partial denial-of-service condition or to leak memory from TPView process running on the system where Workstation or Horizon Client for Windows is installed.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2020-3986 (EMF parser),  CVE-2020-3987 (EMR STRETCHDIBITS parser), and CVE-2020-3988 (JPEG2000 parser) apply the patches listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' found below.
