Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2020-3323:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco Small Business routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The web-based management interface fails to properly validate user-supplied input. This weakness is categorized as CWE-119, which typically involves improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** A successful exploit could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the *root* user on the underlying operating system of the affected device. This means the attacker gains complete control over the device.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The vulnerability has a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as indicated by the CVSS vector: `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to a targeted device through the web-based management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the device to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability from a remote location (not limited to the local network).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the affected device, either through the local LAN or via the WAN if remote management is enabled.
*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send malicious HTTP requests to the device.

**Affected Products:**

*   RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall
*   RV130 VPN Router
*   RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router
*   RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router

**Additional Notes:**

*   The web-based management interface is accessible through the local LAN and also through the WAN if the remote management feature is enabled, which increases the attack surface when enabled.
*   By default, the remote management feature is disabled on these devices.
*   There are no workarounds that fully address the vulnerability other than applying the security updates.
*   Disabling the remote management feature can reduce the attack surface.
