Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3155

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the SSL server certificate when a Cisco Intelligent Proximity client connects to a Cisco Webex video device or collaboration endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient SSL Certificate Validation:** The core issue is the failure to validate the SSL certificate presented by the server (Cisco Webex video device or collaboration endpoint) during connection establishment. This allows a malicious actor to present a forged certificate without being detected by the client.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Vulnerability:** Due to the lack of certificate validation, an attacker can perform a MITM attack by intercepting traffic between the client and the endpoint. They can then use a forged certificate to impersonate the endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could view presentation content shared on the affected endpoint.
*   **Data Modification:** An attacker could modify any content being presented by the victim.
*   **Call Control Access:** An attacker could gain access to call controls, potentially allowing them to:
    *   Dial in and listen on calls.
    *   Impersonate the victim.
    *   View commands sent to the endpoint, including dialed URIs.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Network Attack:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the affected client and the on-premises Cisco Webex video device or collaboration endpoint.
*   **MITM:** The attacker must perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept the network traffic.
*   **Forged SSL Certificate:** The attacker needs a forged SSL certificate to present to the client, impersonating the legitimate endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to intercept the traffic between the client and the endpoint.
*   **MITM Capability:** The attacker needs to have the capability to perform a MITM attack.
*   **Forged Certificate Generation:** The attacker needs to be able to generate or acquire a forged SSL certificate that is trusted by the client software.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker doesn't require any authentication to execute this exploit.
*   **Proximity Feature Enabled:** The Proximity feature must be enabled on both the client and the collaboration endpoint for the attack to be successful.

**Additional Notes:**
*   This vulnerability affects Cisco Intelligent Proximity application, Cisco Jabber, Cisco Webex Meetings, Cisco Webex Teams and Cisco Meeting App when used with on-premise registered devices.
*   Cloud-registered collaboration endpoints are not affected.
*   The provided CVSS score is 7.4 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
*   There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
*   The fix relies on host fingerprint verification and requires both the proximity client and the collaboration endpoint to be upgraded.
*   Cisco fixed this in Cisco Intelligent Proximity Application releases 3.1.0 and later and Cisco Collaboration Endpoint Software releases 9.14.3 and later.
