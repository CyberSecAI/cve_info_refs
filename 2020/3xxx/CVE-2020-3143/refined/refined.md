Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3143:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **insufficient validation of user-supplied input** to the xAPI (video endpoint API) of affected Cisco TelePresence software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal flaw. This means an attacker can manipulate input to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The xAPI does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious path traversal sequences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to read any file on the system.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can also write arbitrary files to the system.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The ability to read and write arbitrary files can lead to complete compromise of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be conducted remotely.
*   **Network:**  The attack vector is network-based.
*   **Crafted Request to xAPI:** The attacker sends a specially crafted request to the xAPI of the affected software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system. This requires either:
    *   An In-Room Control account.
    *   An administrator account.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device.

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software
*   Cisco TelePresence Codec (TC) Software
*   Cisco RoomOS Software (Specific versions, see "Fixed Software" in the advisory)
*   Specifically:
    *   Cisco TelePresence Integrator C Series
    *   Cisco TelePresence MX Series
    *   Cisco TelePresence SX Series
    *   Cisco TelePresence System EX Series
    *   Cisco Webex Board
    *   Cisco Webex DX Series
    *   Cisco Webex Room Series

**Additional Information:**

*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability.
*  **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in specific versions of Cisco TelePresence CE Software, Cisco TC Software and Cisco RoomOS.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 8.8, rated as "High".
*  **CWE:** The vulnerability is classified as CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal').
