- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because certain Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) listeners within Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (CVP) are not properly authenticated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authentication of RMI listeners
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can access sensitive information on an affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted request to the affected RMI listener.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not require prior authentication.
