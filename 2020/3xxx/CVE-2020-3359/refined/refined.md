**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper validation of mDNS packets in Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the handling of mDNS packets, specifically a lack of proper validation, which can be exploited by a crafted packet.

**Impact of exploitation:**

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable by sending a crafted mDNS packet to a vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. They need to be able to send crafted mDNS packets to the targeted device.

**Additional Details:**
- The default configuration of Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers is vulnerable.
- The vulnerability does not require the mDNS gateway to be enabled to be exploitable.
- There are no workarounds that fully address the vulnerability, however, dropping mDNS packets can mitigate the risk for systems that do not require mDNS functionality.
- Cisco has released software updates to fix the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is identified by Cisco Bug ID CSCvr57654.
