Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3357:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper validation of HTTP requests within the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN feature of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insufficient HTTP request validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation could also cause the device to reload, leading to a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP request over an SSL connection to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests over an SSL connection to the affected device, implying network access to the device.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, making it accessible to unauthenticated remote attackers.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Products:**
    - Cisco RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router
    - Cisco RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Router
    - Cisco RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router
    - Cisco RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit POE VPN Router
    - Only devices running a firmware release earlier than 1.0.03.18 with the SSL VPN feature enabled are vulnerable.

- **Mitigation:**
    - The primary fix is to upgrade to firmware release 1.0.03.18 or later.
    - Disabling the SSL VPN feature can also mitigate the vulnerability by eliminating the attack vector, although it is not a workaround.

- **CVSS Score:**
    - The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8, which is rated as critical.
    - The CVSS vector string is: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
        - AV:N (Attack Vector: Network)
        - AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low)
        - PR:N (Privileges Required: None)
        - UI:N (User Interaction: None)
        - S:U (Scope: Unchanged)
        - C:H (Confidentiality Impact: High)
        - I:H (Integrity Impact: High)
        - A:H (Availability Impact: High)
- **CWE:**
  - The vulnerability is associated with CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation).
