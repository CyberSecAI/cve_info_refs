Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3218:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **improper validation of user-supplied input** within the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Input Validation Failure (CWE-20):** The software fails to properly validate input from users, allowing for the injection of malicious content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with *root* privileges on the underlying Linux shell.
*   **License Bypass:** The vulnerability could also be exploited to bypass licensing requirements on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely over the network via the web UI.
*   **File Upload:**  The attack involves first creating a malicious file on the device, then uploading a second malicious file using the web UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated with administrative privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device's web UI.
*   **HTTP Server Enabled:** The device must have the HTTP Server feature enabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**
*  The vulnerability is not exploitable over HTTP if `ip http active-session-modules none` is configured.
*  The vulnerability is not exploitable over HTTPS if `ip http secure-active-session-modules none` is configured.
*  There are no workarounds but disabling the HTTP Server feature eliminates the attack vector.
