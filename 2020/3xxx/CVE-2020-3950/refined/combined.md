##### **3a. Privilege escalation vulnerability via setuid binaries (CVE-2020-3950 )**

**Description**

VMware Fusion, VMRC for Mac and Horizon Client for Mac contain a privilege escalation vulnerability due to improper use of setuid binaries. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Important severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [7.3](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).

**Known Attack Vectors**

Successful exploitation of this issue may allow attackers with normal user privileges to escalate their privileges to root on the system where Fusion, VMRC or Horizon Client is installed.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2020-3950, apply the patches listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Resolution Matrix' found below.

**Workarounds**

**Known Attack Vectors**

Attackers with non-administrative access to a guest VM with virtual printing enabled may exploit this issue to create a denial-of-service condition of the Thinprint service running on the system where Workstation or Horizon Client is installed.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2020-3951, apply the patches listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Resolution Matrix' found below.

**Workarounds**

None.

**Additional Documentation**
