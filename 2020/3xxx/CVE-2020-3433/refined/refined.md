Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3433:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient validation of resources loaded by the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows at runtime.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Hijacking:** The application does not properly validate the DLLs it loads, allowing an attacker to substitute a malicious DLL.
- **Insufficient Resource Validation:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation of resources during runtime.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected machine.
- **SYSTEM Privileges:** The attacker can gain SYSTEM level privileges on the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Interprocess Communication (IPC) Channel:** The vulnerability lies within the IPC channel of the AnyConnect client.
- **Crafted IPC Message:** An attacker sends a malicious IPC message to the AnyConnect process to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the Windows system.
- **Valid Credentials:** The attacker must have valid credentials for a user account on the Windows system.
- **Authenticated:** The attacker needs to be authenticated on the Windows system.

**Summary:**

CVE-2020-3433 is a DLL hijacking vulnerability in the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows. An authenticated, local attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted IPC message to the AnyConnect process. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges by hijacking a DLL loaded by the application. The attacker must have local access and valid credentials. Cisco has released a software update to address this vulnerability.
