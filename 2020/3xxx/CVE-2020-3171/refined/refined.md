Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3171

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input validation in the local management (local-mgmt) CLI of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco UCS Manager Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command injection vulnerability.
- The CLI fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated, local attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system (OS) of an affected device.
- On most affected platforms, the attacker gains privileges of the currently logged-in user.
- On Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects, injected commands are executed with root privileges, leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required
- Attacker must be authenticated to the local management CLI.
- The attacker crafts arguments to specific commands in the CLI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the local management CLI.
- Physical access is not required.

**Affected Products:**
- Firepower 2100 Series
- Firepower 4100 Series
- Firepower 9300 Security Appliances
- UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects
- UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects
