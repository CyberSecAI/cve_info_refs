Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper implementation of countermeasures against the Bleichenbacher attack for cipher suites that rely on RSA for key exchange.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the TLS handler of Cisco ASA and FTD software running on Cisco Firepower 1000 Series firewalls.
- The device acts as an oracle, allowing chosen-ciphertext attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can gain access to sensitive information.
- Successful exploitation allows the attacker to perform cryptanalytic operations, potentially decrypting previously captured TLS sessions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending crafted TLS messages to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to capture TLS traffic between clients and the affected device.
- The attacker needs to actively establish a considerable number of TLS connections to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to capture TLS traffic between clients and the affected device.
- The attacker must be able to actively establish a large number of TLS connections to the affected device.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted TLS messages.
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Firepower 1000 Series firewalls running vulnerable versions of Cisco ASA or FTD software when a feature that processes TLS messages is enabled (e.g., AnyConnect SSL VPN, Clientless SSL VPN).
- A command to check if a device is vulnerable: `show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS`. Output indicates vulnerability.
- Mitigation includes disabling the use of TLS ciphers that rely on RSA for key exchange.
- Software updates have been released to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
