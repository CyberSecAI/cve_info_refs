| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Firepower 1000 Series Bleichenbacher Attack Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-asaftd-tls-bb-2g9uWkP  First Published: 2020 October 21 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvv13993](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv13993)     CVE-2020-3585     CWE-203       CVSS Score: [Base 5.3](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2020-3585     CWE-203       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-tls-bb-2g9uWkP/csaf/cisco-sa-asaftd-tls-bb-2g9uWkP.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the TLS handler of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 1000 Series firewalls could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.  The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of countermeasures against the Bleichenbacher attack for cipher suites that rely on RSA for key exchange. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TLS messages to the device, which would act as an oracle and allow the attacker to carry out a chosen-ciphertext attack. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform cryptanalytic operations that may allow decryption of previously captured TLS sessions to the affected device.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to perform both of the following actions:    + Capture TLS traffic that is in transit between clients and the affected device   + Actively establish a considerable number of TLS connections to the affected device Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-tls-bb-2g9uWkP>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco Firepower 1000 Series firewalls if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software and had a feature enabled that caused the device to process TLS messages. These features include, but are not limited to, the following:    + AnyConnect SSL VPN   + Clientless SSL VPN For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Determine Whether a Device Could Process SSL or TLS Messages To determine whether a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software could process SSL or TLS packets, use the **show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS** command and verify that it returns output. If this command returns any output, the device is vulnerable. If this command returns empty output, the device is not affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory. The following example shows the output of the **show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS** command from a device that is vulnerable:  ```   ftd# show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLSSSL       0005aa68  LISTEN     x.x.x.x:443      0.0.0.0:*   SSL       002d9e38  LISTEN     x.x.x.x:8443     0.0.0.0:*DTLS      0018f7a8  LISTEN     10.0.0.250:443   0.0.0.0:*   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + ASA Software that is running on any platform other than Cisco Firepower 1000 Series   + FTD Software that is running on any platform other than Cisco Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, disabling use of TLS ciphers that rely on RSA for key exchange is a possible mitigation.  **Cisco ASA Software**  To specify the TLS ciphers to be used on a device that is running Cisco ASA Software, use the **ssl cipher**   *version* **custom** command in global configuration mode. Use a custom string to allow only cipher suites based on Diffie-Hellman key exchange (DHE). Use the  **show ssl ciphers**  **all** command to view the list of supported ciphers for each TLS version.  **Cisco FTD Software**  On devices that are running Cisco FTD Software and are managed through Cisco FMC Software, TLS ciphers can be specified through Cisco FMC Software under **Devices > Platform Settings > [Edit | New Policy] > SSL > [Edit | Add]**. Then select a **Custom** security level and add the desired ciphers.  Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) does not currently support the selection of specific SSL/TLS ciphers or cipher suites.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases At the time of publication, the release information in the following table(s) was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  The left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and which release included the fix for this vulnerability.  **Cisco ASA Software**       | Cisco ASA Software Release | First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability |   | --- | --- |   | Earlier than 9.131 | Not applicable |   | 9.13 | 9.13.1.13 |   | 9.14 | 9.14.1.30 |      1. Cisco ASA Software releases earlier than 9.13 do not support Cisco Firepower 1000 Series firewalls. **Cisco FTD Software**       | Cisco FTD Software Release | First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability |   | --- | --- |   | Earlier than 6.4.01 | Not applicable |   | 6.4.0 | 6.4.0.10 |   | 6.5.0 | 6.5.0.5 (future release) |   | 6.6.0 | 6.6.1 |      1. Cisco FTD Software releases earlier than 6.4.0 do not support Cisco Firepower 1000 Series firewalls. To upgrade to a fixed release of Cisco FTD Software, do one of the following:    + For devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), use the FMC interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy.   + For devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), use the FDM interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 5.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 5.3 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 5.3 |
