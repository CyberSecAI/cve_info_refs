Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of the issue:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) server component in Cisco Expressway and TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) allows media connections to be relayed through a firewall using proxy services. This functionality, when enabled, inadvertently exposes administrative interfaces to external networks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypassed Firewall Protections:** The TURN server, when enabled, bypasses firewall rules intended to restrict access to the Cisco Expressway web administrative interface.
*   **Lack of Proper Documentation:** The documentation for the TURN server feature did not initially clearly explain that enabling it could lead to the exposure of administrative ports to external networks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Administrative Ports:** Attackers can access administrative ports of the Cisco Expressway or VCS host from external networks, which are typically intended to be accessible only from internal networks or secure management networks.
*   **Potential Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with sufficient credentials to use the TURN services can send network requests to the web administrative interface, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data breaches

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** Attackers can exploit this issue from external networks.
*   **Through TURN Server:** The attacker must have the ability to send network requests via the TURN server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network access to the Cisco Expressway/VCS system's TURN server.
*   **TURN Credentials:** The attacker must possess valid credentials that are sufficient to utilize the TURN service to gain access to administrative ports.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This issue was initially categorized as a medium-severity vulnerability but was later reclassified as an informational issue, indicating that it is more of a configuration issue or a lack of documentation clarity than a true vulnerability.
*   There are no workarounds available to address this issue other than disabling the TURN server feature, which would prevent the issue from being exploited but would also remove the featureâ€™s intended functionality.
*   The issue is primarily a matter of documentation and user awareness: users need to understand that enabling the TURN server can expose administrative ports that would otherwise be protected by firewalls.
*   The CVSS score for this issue is 0.0, indicating no real impact as long as the TURN feature is not in use or access to the TURN server is restricted.
