**Description**

VMware Workstation and Fusion contain a use-after vulnerability in vmnetdhcp.VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Critical severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [9.3](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Known Attack Vectors**

Successful exploitation of this issue may lead to code execution on the host from the guest or may allow attackers to create a denial-of-service condition of the vmnetdhcp service running on the host machine.

##### **3b. Local Privilege escalation vulnerability in Cortado Thinprint (CVE-2020-3948)**

**Description**

Linux Guest VMs running on VMware Workstation and Fusion contain a local privilege escalation vulnerability due to improper file permissions in Cortado Thinprint. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Important severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [7.8](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing is enabled in the Guest VM. Virtual printing is not enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion.

**Known Attack Vectors**

Local attackers with non-administrative access to a Linux guest VM with virtual printing enabled may exploit this issue to elevate their privileges to root on the same guest VM.
