Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3504:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of CLI command parameters within the local management (local-mgmt) CLI of Cisco UCS Manager Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of CLI command parameters leads to a denial-of-service condition. Specifically, the vulnerability allows an attacker to cause internal system processes to fail to terminate properly, leading to a buildup of stuck processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause internal system processes (specifically `ucssh` processes) to fail to terminate properly.
- This results in a buildup of stuck processes, leading to:
    - Slowness in accessing the UCS Manager CLI and web UI.
    - Sustained attacks may cause a restart of internal UCS Manager processes, resulting in temporary loss of access to the UCS Manager CLI and web UI.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs local access to the affected device.
- The attacker needs to execute specific commands on the local-mgmt CLI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated with local access to the device.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute commands on the local-mgmt CLI.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects running vulnerable versions of Cisco UCS Manager Software.
- The advisory provides a command to check for stuck `ucssh` processes: `show processes | include ucssh`
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
- The fix is included in Cisco UCS Software Release 4.0(4i) for the affected devices. Version 4.1 is not vulnerable.
- The vulnerability was found internally by Art Kalmykov of Cisco.
- The CVSS score is 3.3, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L.
