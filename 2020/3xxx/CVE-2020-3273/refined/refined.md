Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3273:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incomplete input validation of 802.11 Generic Advertisement Service (GAS) frames processed by Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate input validation of 802.11 GAS frames.
- Lack of proper handling of crafted 802.11 GAS payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause the affected WLC to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted 802.11 GAS frame over the air to an access point (AP), which then relays it to the vulnerable WLC.
- Sending a malicious 802.11 GAS payload within a Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) packet to the WLC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote.
- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted 802.11 GAS frames over the air to an access point associated with a vulnerable WLC or have Layer 3 connectivity to the vulnerable WLC.
- The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco WLC devices that have at least one WLAN with the HotSpot2.0 feature enabled.
- There are no known workarounds.
- The Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers are not affected.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 8.6 (HIGH).
