- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow issue in Cortado ThinPrint component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An integer overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure, specifically memory leakage from the TPView process.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor with normal access to a virtual machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have normal access to a virtual machine where virtual printing is enabled. This feature is enabled by default on Horizon Client but not on Workstation.
