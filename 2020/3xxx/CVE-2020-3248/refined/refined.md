Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-3248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the REST API of Cisco UCS Director and UCS Director Express for Big Data. Specifically, this lack of proper validation occurs before the input is used in file operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks. This means they can potentially access files and directories outside of the intended scope.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The software fails to properly validate user-supplied input to the REST API, making directory traversal possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution with root privileges:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute code with root privileges on the affected system.
*   **Arbitrary File access:** Although not explicitly stated for this CVE in the advisory from Cisco, the ZDI advisory states that the attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.
*   **System takeover:** the ability to execute code as root could lead to system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted request to the REST API.
*   **REST API:** The vulnerability exists within the REST API of the affected software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated access:** The attacker needs to have valid authentication credentials for the system to exploit this vulnerability
*  **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send crafted requests to the REST API, implying network access to the vulnerable device

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco UCS Director and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data are affected.
*   **CVE-2020-3248** is one of several vulnerabilities addressed in the same Cisco Security Advisory.
*  The ZDI advisory states that authentication is *not required* for exploitation, although the Cisco advisory states that authentication is required. This may imply different attack vectors or that the ZDI advisory is not specific to only CVE-2020-3248
*   **CVSS Score:** 8.1 (Cisco), although the ZDI advisory lists a score of 9.8
