**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from inefficient Direct Memory Access (DMA) memory management during the SSL VPN connection negotiation phase.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inefficient DMA memory handling

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by exhausting the device's DMA memory, leading to a reload (crash) of the affected Cisco ASA or FTD device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- Attackers send a steady stream of crafted Datagram TLS (DTLS) traffic to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device
- The attacker does not require any authentication.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft DTLS packets.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects devices with Clientless SSL VPN or AnyConnect SSL VPN configured.
- There are no workarounds.
- The advisory was updated to reflect that a new vulnerability may affect recommended fixed releases for code trains 9.13 and 9.14.
- The advisory provides a command to check for a reduction in free DMA memory.
- The advisory lists specific affected and fixed software releases for both Cisco ASA and FTD software.
- The CVSS score is 8.6 (High).
