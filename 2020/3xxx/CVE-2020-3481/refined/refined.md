{
  "cve": "CVE-2020-3481",
  "description": "It was discovered that ClamAV incorrectly handled parsing EGG archives. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ClamAV to crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "0.102.0",
    "0.102.1",
    "0.102.2",
    "0.102.3"
  ],
  "root_cause": "Improper error handling in the EGG archive parsing module leading to a NULL pointer dereference.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "NULL pointer dereference",
    "Improper error handling"
  ],
  "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) due to a crash of the ClamAV service.",
  "attack_vector": "Remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted EGG archive to ClamAV for scanning.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit a malicious file for scanning by ClamAV, or have ClamAV scan the malicious file.",
  "mitigations": "The vulnerability is mitigated for those using the official ClamAV signature databases because the file type signatures in daily.cvd will not enable the EGG archive parser in affected versions."
