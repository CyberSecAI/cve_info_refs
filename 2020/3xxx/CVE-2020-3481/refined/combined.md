| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1858264#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2020-07-17 11:40:25 UTC  ``` Fixed a vulnerability in the EGG archive module in ClamAV 0.102.0 - 0.102.3 that could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Improper error handling could cause a crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. This vulnerability is mitigated for those using the official ClamAV signature databases because the file type signatures in daily.cvd will not enable the EGG archive parser in affected versions.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1858264#c1)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2020-07-17 11:41:51 UTC  ``` Created clamav tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1858266](show_bug.cgi?id=1858266 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-3481 clamav: improper error handling causing crash due to NULL pointer dereference [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1858265](show_bug.cgi?id=1858265 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-3481 clamav: improper error handling causing crash due to NULL pointer dereference [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1858264#c2)  Florencio Cano    2020-07-22 07:16:32 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3481> <https://blog.clamav.net/2020/07/clamav-01024-security-patch-released.html> <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3481># <https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav-devel/commit/8bb3716be9c7ab7c6a3a1889267b1072f48af87b>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1858264#c3)  Florencio Cano    2020-07-22 07:19:14 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  There is no mitigation for this issue, the flaw can only be resolved by applying updates.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1858264#c4)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-07-22 07:27:37 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

### ClamAV 0.102.4 security patch released

ClamAV 0.102.4 is out now. Users can head over to [clamav.net/downloads](https://www.clamav.net/downloads) to download the release materials.

ClamAV 0.102.4 is a bug patch release to address the following issues:
### [CVE-2020-3350](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3350)

Fixed a vulnerability a malicious user could exploit to replace a scan target's directory with a symlink to another path to trick clamscan, clamdscan, or clamonacc into removing or moving a different file (such as a critical system file). The issue would affect users that use the --move or --remove options for clamscan, clamdscan and clamonacc.

For more information about AV quarantine attacks using links, see [RACK911 Lab's report](https://www.rack911labs.com/research/exploiting-almost-every-antivirus-software).

### [CVE-2020-3327](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3327)

Fixed a vulnerability in the ARJ archive-parsing module in ClamAV 0.102.3 that could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Improper bounds checking resulted in an out-of-bounds read that could cause a crash. The previous fix for this CVE in version 0.102.3 was incomplete. This fix correctly resolves the issue.

### [CVE-2020-3481](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3481)

Fixed a vulnerability in the EGG archive module in ClamAV 0.102.0 - 0.102.3 that could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Improper error handling could cause a crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. This vulnerability is mitigated for those using the official ClamAV signature databases because the file type signatures in daily.cvd will not enable the EGG archive parser in affected versions.

We will be publishing a release candidate for version 0.103.0 in the next couple of weeks. Stay tuned!

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2314-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>               Emilio Pozuelo Monfort

Package        : clamav
Version        : 0.102.4+dfsg-0+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-3327 CVE-2020-3350 CVE-2020-3481

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the ClamAV antivirus toolkit:

CVE-2020-3327

    An out of bounds read in the ARJ archive-parsing module could cause
    denial of service. The fix in 0.102.3 was incomplete.

CVE-2020-3350

    A malicious user could trick clamscan, clamdscan or clamonacc into
    moving or removing a different file than intended when those are
    used with one of the --move or --remove options. This could be used
    to get rid of special system files.

CVE-2020-3481

    The EGG archive module was vulnerable to denial of service via NULL
    pointer dereference due to improper error handling. The official
    signature database avoided this problem because the signatures there
    avoided the use of the EGG archive parser.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
0.102.4+dfsg-0+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.

its security tracker page at:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1858261#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2020-07-17 11:36:03 UTC  ``` A vulnerability in the endpoint software of Cisco AMP for Endpoints and Clam AntiVirus could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause the running software to delete arbitrary files on the system. The vulnerability is due to a race condition that could occur when scanning malicious files. An attacker with local shell access could exploit this vulnerability by executing a script that could trigger the race condition. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files on the system that the attacker would not normally have privileges to delete, producing system instability or causing the endpoint software to stop working.  References: <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-famp-ZEpdXy>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1858261#c1)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2020-07-17 11:36:58 UTC  ``` Created clamav tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1858263](show_bug.cgi?id=1858263 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-3350 clamav: malicious user exploit to replace scan target's directory with symlink [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1858262](show_bug.cgi?id=1858262 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2020-3350 clamav: malicious user exploit to replace scan target's directory with symlink [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1858261#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-07-21 19:28:11 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-dd0c20d985
2020-07-28 15:00:49.911952
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : clamav
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 0.102.4
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <https://www.clamav.net/>
Summary : End-user tools for the Clam Antivirus scanner
Description :
Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose of this
software is the integration with mail servers (attachment scanning). The
package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command
line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via Internet. The programs
are based on a shared library distributed with the Clam AntiVirus package,
which you can use with your own software. The virus database is based on
the virus database from OpenAntiVirus, but contains additional signatures
(including signatures for popular polymorphic viruses, too) and is KEPT UP
TO DATE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

ClamAV 0.102.4 is a bug patch release to address the following issues:
CVE-2020-3350 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3350>
Fixed a vulnerability a malicious user could exploit to replace a scan target's
directory with a symlink to another path to trick clamscan, clamdscan, or
clamonacc into removing or moving a different file (such as a critical system
file). The issue would affect users that use the --move or --remove options for
clamscan, clamdscan and clamonacc. For more information about AV quarantine
attacks using links, see RACK911 Lab's report
[https://www.rack911labs.com/research/exploiting-almost-every-antivirus-
software](https://www.rack911labs.com/research/exploiting-almost-every-antivirus-%0Asoftware). CVE-2020-3327 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-
bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3327](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-%0Abin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3327) Fixed a vulnerability in the ARJ archive-
parsing module in ClamAV 0.102.3 that could cause a denial-of-service (DoS)
condition. Improper bounds checking resulted in an out-of-bounds read that could
cause a crash. The previous fix for this CVE in version 0.102.3 was incomplete.
This fix correctly resolves the issue. CVE-2020-3481
<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3481> Fixed a
vulnerability in the EGG archive module in ClamAV 0.102.0 - 0.102.3 that could
cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Improper error handling could cause a
crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. This vulnerability is mitigated for
those using the official ClamAV signature databases because the file type
signatures in daily.cvd will not enable the EGG archive parser in affected
versions.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-6584a641ae
2020-08-01 00:49:35.658947
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : clamav
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 0.102.4
Release : 1.fc32
URL : <https://www.clamav.net/>
Summary : End-user tools for the Clam Antivirus scanner
Description :
Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose of this
software is the integration with mail servers (attachment scanning). The
package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command
line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via Internet. The programs
are based on a shared library distributed with the Clam AntiVirus package,
which you can use with your own software. The virus database is based on
the virus database from OpenAntiVirus, but contains additional signatures
(including signatures for popular polymorphic viruses, too) and is KEPT UP
TO DATE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

ClamAV 0.102.4 is a bug patch release to address the following issues:
CVE-2020-3350 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3350>
Fixed a vulnerability a malicious user could exploit to replace a scan target's
directory with a symlink to another path to trick clamscan, clamdscan, or
clamonacc into removing or moving a different file (such as a critical system
file). The issue would affect users that use the --move or --remove options for
clamscan, clamdscan and clamonacc. For more information about AV quarantine
attacks using links, see RACK911 Lab's report
[https://www.rack911labs.com/research/exploiting-almost-every-antivirus-
software](https://www.rack911labs.com/research/exploiting-almost-every-antivirus-%0Asoftware). CVE-2020-3327 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-
bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3327](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-%0Abin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3327) Fixed a vulnerability in the ARJ archive-
parsing module in ClamAV 0.102.3 that could cause a denial-of-service (DoS)
condition. Improper bounds checking resulted in an out-of-bounds read that could
cause a crash. The previous fix for this CVE in version 0.102.3 was incomplete.
This fix correctly resolves the issue. CVE-2020-3481
<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3481> Fixed a
vulnerability in the EGG archive module in ClamAV 0.102.0 - 0.102.3 that could
cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Improper error handling could cause a
crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. This vulnerability is mitigated for
those using the official ClamAV signature databases because the file type
signatures in daily.cvd will not enable the EGG archive parser in affected
versions.
