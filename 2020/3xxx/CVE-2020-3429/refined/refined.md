Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-3429:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the incorrect packet processing during the WPA2 and WPA3 authentication handshake in Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software when configured for dot1x or pre-shared key (PSK) authentication key management (AKM) with 802.11r BSS Fast Transition (FT) enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect packet processing during WPA2/WPA3 authentication handshake with dot1x/PSK AKM and 802.11r FT enabled. This is a CWE-20: Improper Input Validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted authentication packet to an affected device.
- The attacker needs to be in an adjacent network location to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in an adjacent network location to the affected device.
- While the advisory summary states no authentication is required, the detailed description states that valid credentials for dot1x or PSK AKM to access the WLAN are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Cisco Catalyst 9000 Family, specifically Catalyst 9800 Embedded Wireless Controllers and Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers.
- The vulnerability exists only when 802.11r Fast Transition (FT) is enabled with either dot1x or PSK AKM configured.
- There are no workarounds that directly address the vulnerability. However, disabling the 802.11r Fast Transition (FT) feature mitigates the vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to fix this issue.

**CVSS Score:**
- Base Score: 7.4
- Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
