The provided content contains information about CVE-2020-3965.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation on a bit field value within the XHCI USB controller. The map size can be out of sync with the loop counter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the XHCI USB controller. Specifically, a guest can supply a size value of 0x40 with a bit field value of 0xffffffff. This causes the loop to copy 32 elements out of the mapped page, which is outside the bounds of the mapped region.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious actor with local access to a virtual machine can exploit this vulnerability to read privileged information contained in hypervisor memory from a virtual machine.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local access to a virtual machine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have local access to a virtual machine.
