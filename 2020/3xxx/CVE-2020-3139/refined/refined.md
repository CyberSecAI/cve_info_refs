Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a programming logic error in the configuration of specific IP table entries for the out-of-band (OOB) management interface of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC). This error results in IP ports being permitted when they should be dropped based on the configured deny rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **IP Table Rule Bypass:**  The primary weakness is that the configured deny rules for specific IP ports on the OOB management interface are not properly enforced.  Due to the programming logic error, traffic intended to be blocked is permitted.
- **Incorrect Configuration Programming:** The root cause is a logic flaw in how the deny rules for specific IP ports are programmed into the system's IP tables. The UI/CLI shows the correct configuration, but the underlying enforcement mechanism is flawed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing Access Controls:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass the intended IP table rules that should have blocked traffic to specific ports.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the attacker cannot control the device's configuration directly, bypassing access control could potentially enable other forms of attacks depending on the services listening on the accessible ports.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending traffic to the OOB management interface on the targeted device. The attacker doesn't require any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based, where the attacker sends traffic to the OOB management interface on the targeted device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the OOB management interface of the vulnerable Cisco APIC.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need any credentials to exploit the vulnerability. They can simply send traffic to the targeted interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The `acidiag run iptables-list` command shows that a port is configured to be denied, but the system is not programmed with that rule due to the underlying error.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco APIC releases prior to 4.2(3j).
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
