Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3508:

**Root Cause:**

*   Insufficient error handling when a Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Router with a 20-Gbps Embedded Services Processor (ESP) reaches platform limitations related to ARP entries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the IP Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) feature of Cisco IOS XE Software.
*   The software fails to properly handle errors when the device reaches its ARP cache limit, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit can cause the affected device to reload, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
*   The attacker can exhaust system resources by sending malicious ARP messages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is adjacent.
*   An attacker needs to be within the same network segment to send the malicious ARP messages to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.
*   The attacker does not need any authentication to send the malicious ARP messages.
*  The attacker must be able to send a malicious series of IP ARP messages.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers with a 20-Gbps ESP installed and running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   A workaround is available using the `arp entries interface-limit` command in global configuration mode to configure a per-interface ARP cache limit.
* The CVSS score is 7.4, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
* This vulnerability is tracked by Cisco Bug IDs CSCva53392 and CSCvu04413
