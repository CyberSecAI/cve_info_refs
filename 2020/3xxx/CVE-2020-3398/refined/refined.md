Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3398:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the incorrect parsing of a specific type of BGP MVPN (Multicast VPN) update message within the Cisco NX-OS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper parsing of BGP MVPN update messages
- A valid BGP MVPN update message is processed incorrectly by the NX-OS device, which could send a corrupted BGP update to the configured BGP peer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause the BGP peer connections to reset repeatedly.
- This can lead to BGP route instability, potentially impacting network traffic and resulting in a partial Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker sends a specially crafted BGP MVPN update message over an established TCP connection to a targeted device.
- The message must appear to come from a trusted BGP peer, requiring some knowledge of the network's BGP configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send TCP packets to the affected device on port 179 (the BGP port).
- The attacker must have some knowledge about the target device's BGP peers in order to spoof a trusted peer.
- The attacker must be able to craft a specific BGP MVPN update message that triggers the vulnerability.
- The targeted device must have BGP with MVPN configured and a peer configured.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 3000, 7000, and 9000 series switches in standalone NX-OS mode when feature ngmvpn is configured.
- There are no workarounds available.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
- The vulnerability is rated as High severity with a CVSS base score of 8.6.
- The vulnerability was found during internal testing by Cisco.
- The document explicitly states that the Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic from only explicitly configured peers.
