Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3168:

**Root Cause:**
- Improper resource allocation during failed CLI login attempts when Secure Login Enhancements are configured.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The Secure Login Enhancements feature, intended to block login attempts after multiple failures, can be abused.
-  The vulnerability exists in the Cisco Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM) when running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 5.2(1)SV3(4.1a) and has Secure Login Enhancements configured using login parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
- Affected VSM becomes inaccessible through the CLI.
- Requires a manual power cycle of the VSM to recover.
- CLI login process fails to authenticate any user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- Network access to the affected device is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send a high volume of failed login attempts to the affected device's CLI interface.
- No prior authentication is needed.

**Additional details:**
- The Secure Login Enhancements feature is enabled using commands like `login block-for 120 attempts 10 within 60`.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a high number of failed login attempts.
- Successful exploitation causes the CLI login process to fail, resulting in the device becoming inaccessible.
- There are no workarounds that address the vulnerability, although disabling Secure Login Enhancements and using ACLs on the management interface can mitigate the impact.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- Exploitation of this vulnerability can be identified by observing repeated “Authentication failed” log messages or using the “show login failures” CLI command. Successful exploitation will cause PAM related error messages related to initialization failure.
