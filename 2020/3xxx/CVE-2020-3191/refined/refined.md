Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper length validation of a field within an IPv6 DNS packet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation: The Cisco ASA and FTD software fail to correctly validate the length of a specific field in the IPv6 DNS packet. This allows for crafted packets to be sent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause the affected device (Cisco ASA or FTD) to unexpectedly reload. This results in a DoS condition, disrupting network services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
- Network: The attacker sends a crafted DNS query over IPv6 that traverses the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted IPv6 DNS packet to a vulnerable Cisco ASA or FTD device.
- The attacker does not need any authentication or special privileges. They can be an unauthenticated remote attacker.
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the network so that their crafted IPv6 DNS packets are routed through the affected device. The device must have IPv6 routes present.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is specific to DNS over IPv6 traffic only. DNS over IPv4 traffic is not affected.
- The advisory provides a CLI command `show ipv6 route summary` to help administrators determine if their device has IPv6 routes present that are required for exploitation.
- No workarounds are available to mitigate the vulnerability other than upgrading the affected software.
- Cisco has released free software updates to address the vulnerability, detailed in the advisory.

This vulnerability allows for a relatively simple attack that can lead to a complete denial of service, making it a significant security issue for organizations using affected Cisco devices.
