For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-osinj-rce-pwTkPCJv>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco Small Business Routers if they are running Firmware Release 1.0.03.19 or earlier:    + RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Router   + RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router   + RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router   + RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit POE VPN Router The web-based management interface for these devices is available through local LAN connections by default and cannot be disabled there. The interface can also be made available through the WAN interface by enabling the remote management feature. By default, the remote management feature is disabled on affected devices.  To determine whether the remote management feature is enabled for a device, open the web-based management interface through a local LAN connection and choose **Basic Settings > Remote Management**. If the **Enable** check box is checked, remote management is enabled for the device. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco products:    + RV160 VPN Router   + RV160W Wireless-AC VPN Router   + RV260 VPN Router  Details  * The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one vulnerability is not required to exploit the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.  **Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers Command Injection Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the underlying OS.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  CVE-ID: CVE-2020-3451Bug ID(s): [CSCvu40103](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu40103)Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 7.3CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L  **Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient boundary restrictions on user-supplied input to scripts in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests that contain overly large values to an affected device, causing a buffer overflow. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to temporarily degrade the performance of the interface process or execute arbitrary code on the underlying OS.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  CVE-ID: CVE-2020-3453Bug ID(s): [CSCvu49391](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu49391)Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 7.3CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Cisco fixed these vulnerabilities in Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers firmware releases 1.0.03.20 and later.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.  Source  * Cisco would like to thank 0x00string, working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), for reporting these vulnerabilities.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.3 |
| Environmental Parameters |

| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.8, [AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | RV340 |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Cisco RV340 routers. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of the fileparam parameter provided to the upload.cgi endpoint. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the www-data user. |
