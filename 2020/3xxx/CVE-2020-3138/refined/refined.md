**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient signature validation within the upgrade component of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient signature validation: The software does not properly verify the digital signature or integrity of the upgrade file, allowing for malicious modification.
- Code injection/Remote Code Execution: By providing a crafted upgrade file, an attacker could potentially upload and execute arbitrary code on the affected device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to:
  - Installation of malicious code on the affected device.
  - Remote code execution.
  - Full compromise of the device, with possible impacts on confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system and network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker must have local access to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated, local user with high privileges (PR:H) on the device.
- The attacker needs the ability to upload or provide the crafted upgrade file to the device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco NFVIS releases 3.11.1 and earlier.
- There are no workarounds that directly address the vulnerability besides manually verifying the upgrade file hashes.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
