Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3446:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the presence of default, static passwords for user accounts in Cisco Virtual Wide Area Application Services (vWAAS) with Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS)-bundled images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials** - The software uses default, static passwords, which are easily guessable or publicly known.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise**: Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to log into the NFVIS CLI with *administrator* privileges.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability Impact**: The attacker gains full access, which could lead to:
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   Modification of system configurations and data.
    *   Disruption of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to establish a connection to the NFVIS CLI, which can be achieved through:
    *   **Ethernet management port:**  Accessing the CPU's Ethernet management port on the ENCS 5400-W Series appliance if a routed IP is configured.
    *   **First port of the I350 PCIe Ethernet Adapter card:** Accessing the first port on the four-port I350 PCIe Ethernet Adapter card on the CSP 5000-W Series appliance if a routed IP is configured.
    *   **vWAAS software CLI:** Connecting to the vWAAS software CLI with valid user credentials, and then pivot to the NFVIS CLI.
    *   **Cisco Integrated Management Controller (CIMC):** Connecting to the CIMC interface with valid user credentials, and then pivot to the NFVIS CLI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network connectivity to the affected device's management interface or the ability to access it through other means like vWAAS CLI or CIMC.
*   **No Authentication Required (Initially):** The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access due to the default credentials. However, after gaining access to either vWAAS CLI or CIMC the attacker would need valid credentials to access NFVIS CLI.

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco ENCS 5400-W Series and CSP 5000-W Series appliances running Cisco vWAAS with NFVIS-bundled image releases 6.4.5, or 6.4.3d and earlier.
*   Standalone NFVIS running on Cisco ENCS 5000 Series and Cisco CSP 5000 Series devices are not affected.
*   Standalone vWAAS software or WAAS software running on Cisco Wide Area Virtualization Engine (WAVE) appliances are not affected.

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply the provided software updates to Cisco vWAAS with NFVIS-bundled image release 6.4.3e, 6.4.5a, or later releases.
*   Customers must perform a fresh install with the required version of the Cisco WAAS Unified Package for ENCS 5400-W and CSP 5000-W appliances, as direct upgrades are not supported for these releases.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through internal security testing by Cisco.
*   There are no known public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS base score for this vulnerability is 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
