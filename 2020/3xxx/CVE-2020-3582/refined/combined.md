| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.

| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.

The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web services interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information.  **Note:** These vulnerabilities affect only specific AnyConnect and WebVPN configurations. For more information, see the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-xss-multiple-FCB3vPZe>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, these vulnerabilities affected Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software with a vulnerable AnyConnect or WebVPN configuration.

See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Cisco ASA Software In the following table, the left column lists the Cisco ASA Software features that were vulnerable at the time of publication. The right column indicates the basic configuration for each feature from the **show running-config** CLI command. If a device is running a vulnerable release and is configured for one of these features, it is affected by these vulnerabilities.       | Cisco ASA Software Feature | Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | AnyConnect Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) Remote Access (with client services) | ``` crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port  ``` |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN | ``` webvpn enable  ``` |   | Clientless SSL VPN | ``` webvpn enable  ``` |      Cisco FTD Software In the following table, the left column lists the Cisco FTD Software features that were vulnerable at the time of publication. The right column indicates the basic configuration for each feature from the **show running-config** CLI command. If a device is running a vulnerable release and is configured for one of these features, it is affected by these vulnerabilities.       | Cisco FTD Software Feature | Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | AnyConnect Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) Remote Access (with client services)1,2 | ``` crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port  ``` |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN1,2 | ``` webvpn enable  ``` |      1. Remote Access VPN features are first supported in Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.2.2. Remote Access VPN features are enabled by using **Devices > VPN > Remote Access** in Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) or by using **Device > Remote Access VPN** in Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM).      Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases At the time of publication, the release information in the following table(s) was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  The left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerabilities described in this advisory and which release included the fix for these vulnerabilities.  **Note:** It was found that the fix for CVE-2020-3581 was incomplete and is now fixed and tracked by [CSCvw53796](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw53796). The First Fixed Release for These Vulnerabilities column has been updated to account for the complete fix.  **Cisco ASA Software**       | Cisco ASA Software Release | First Fixed Release for These Vulnerabilities |   | --- | --- |   | Earlier than 9.61 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 9.61 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 9.71 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 9.8 | 9.8.4.34 |   | 9.9 | 9.9.2.85 |   | 9.101 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 9.12 | 9.12.4.13 |   | 9.13 | 9.13.1.21 |   | 9.14 | 9.14.2.8 |   | 9.15 | 9.15.1.15 |       1. Cisco ASA Software releases 9.7 and earlier, as well as Release 9.10, have reached [end of software maintenance](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-listing.html).

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 6.1 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.1 |
| Environmental Parameters |
