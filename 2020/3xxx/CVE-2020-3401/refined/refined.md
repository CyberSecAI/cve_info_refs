Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of HTTP requests within the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the presence of a path traversal vulnerability. The software does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in HTTP requests, specifically concerning directory traversal character sequences (e.g., `../`). This allows an attacker to manipulate file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass access controls and read arbitrary files on the affected system. This could expose sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests.
- **HTTP Requests:**  The specific attack vector involves sending crafted HTTP requests containing directory traversal sequences to the affected system's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software. This means they would need valid credentials to log in before attempting to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the affected system.

**Additional details:**
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software releases 19.2.2 and earlier.
- **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Release 19.2.3.
- **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability besides upgrading to the fixed version.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 (Medium severity), with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
- The advisory notes that the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is tracked by Cisco Bug ID CSCvt74757 and CVE ID CVE-2020-3401.
