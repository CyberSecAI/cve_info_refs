Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3156:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the improper validation of endpoint data that is stored in logs and used by the web-based interface of the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). This arises from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled data that is then reflected in a web page.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary script code within the context of the affected web interface.
    *   The attacker may gain access to sensitive, browser-based information.
    *   Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized actions on behalf of a user or compromise the user's account.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network (AV:N).
    *   An attacker can send malicious endpoint data to the targeted system. This likely involves crafted input that is not properly handled before being stored in logs and displayed through the web interface.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need any privileges on the system (PR:N).
    *   User interaction is required (UI:R) - the victim has to view a log page in the web interface where the malicious code is rendered.
    *   The attack is not isolated to the direct target (S:C) - it could impact other users or systems through the web browser.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Release 2.6.0 patches 1, 2, and 3; and ISE 2.7.0 FCS.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.1, classified as medium severity.
*   **Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available to mitigate the vulnerability without patching.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   **Exploitation:** There were no public announcements or known malicious use of the vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
*   **Reporting:** The vulnerability was reported by Max Moser & Katharina Maennle of Modzero.
