| vsepflt.sys | 11.0.5.0 |
| vnetflt.sys | 11.0.0.0 (For Kernel-Mode Code Signing, Windows Vista and Windows 2008 only) |
| vnetWFP.sys | 11.0.5.0 |
| glgxi.sys | 2.3.0.0 |
| giappdef | 2.3.0.0 |
| **Security DLL** | |
| vmwsu.dll | 2.0.0.0 |

## Resolved Issues

* **Outbound IPv6 traffic for ICMP and UDP protocols could experience packet drops.**

  NSX Network Introspection Driver is used to retrieve the network context from the Guest VMs.
   From VMTools 11.0.0, support has been added for ICMP and UDP protocols. The driver now intercepts the UDP and ICMP traffic, collects the required context, and re-injects the packets back. There was a problem in the packet re-injection code for the ICMP and UDP IPv6 packets for outbound traffic. As a result, outbound IPv6 traffic for ICMP and UDP protocols could experience packet drops.

  Note: Network Introspection Driver is not installed by default and can be installed with VMware Tools ‘Complete’ installation for NSX IDFW and NSX Intelligent features only.

  This issue is fixed in this release.
* **"Permission Denied" errors when /tmp is mounted with "noexec" option in Linux guests.**

  In Linux guests, when /tmp is mounted with "noexec" option, any solution that depends on running a program or script stored under /tmp inside the guest using VMware Tools fails.

  In this version of VMware Tools, tools.conf can be used to override the environment variables for vmtoolsd instances as following:

  [setenvironment]
   # Setting TMPDIR for all vmtoolsd instance:
   TMPDIR=/path/to/common/tmpdir
   # Setting TMPDIR for vmsvc instance only:
   vmsvc.TMPDIR=/path/to/vmsvc/tmpdir
   # Setting TMPDIR for vmusr instance only:
   vmusr.TMPDIR=/path/to/vmusr/tmpdir

  Note: Environment settings are applied when vmtoolsd starts up. So, vmtoolsd needs restart for new settings to take effect.
* **DNS server is reported incorrectly as '127.0.0.53' when using systemd-resolved.**

  DNS server is reported incorrectly in GuestInfo as '127.0.0.53' , when the OS uses systemd-resolved.

  This issue is fixed in this release.
* **Changing the VM to a large display toplogy fails on Windows 7 and earlier, when Aero is disabled.**

  Users are unable to switch to a large display topology (example, 3 full screen monitors) on Windows 7 and earlier, when Aero is disabled.

  vmware.log has the following log message:

  2019-07-31T12:48:03.471+08:00| vcpu-0| I125: Guest: vm3d: Memory required for all screens exceeds maximum FB (required=160546816 max=134217728)

  This issue is fixed in this release.

## Known Issues

* **Automatic upgrade of VMware Tools fails to complete on a Windows Server 2008 SP2 Virtual Machine.**

  When VMware Tools is upgraded using any of the following approaches:

  + Enabling VM setting "Check and upgrade VMware Tools before each power on"
     OR
  + From host/vCenter UI/API for Windows Server 2008 SP2 VMs

  If the user session login is not interactive, the VMware Tools upgrader process keeps waiting indefinitely for the exit of the 'vcredist\_x86.exe' process. As a result, log data increases and vminst.log runs out of disk space.

  Workaround:

  Refer to [KB 76685](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/76685).
* **When users log in to a Windows Server OS remote desktop session, the VMware Tools user service process stops after startup.**

  When users log in to a Windows Server OS remote desktop session, the VMware Tools user service process stops after startup. For more details, refer [KB 74808](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/74808).

  Workaround:

  If the VMware Tools user process is not present on the system, it can be started manually using the Windows Run Command box or from a command prompt.

  To launch the VMware Tools process using the Windows run command box:

  1. Open the Windows Run dialog by pressing the Windows + R keys at the same time.
  2. Run this command to start the VMware Tools process: "C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Tools\vmtoolsd.exe" -n vmusr
* **AppDefense driver glxgi logs an error in the event viewer.**

  AppDefense driver glxgi logs an error in the event viewer similar to the following:

  "The glxgi service failed to start due to the following error: A device attached to the system is not functioning."

  The events are observed when Guest Integrity is disabled.

  Workaround:

  These events do not impact the system and are safe to ignore.
* **Event Viewer driver warnings generated by VMware Tools boot start drivers glxgi, pvscsi, vsepflt, and vsock.**

  When you have a secure boot VM with Microsoft Hyper-V and virtualization-based security enabled with Device Guard and Code Integrity policy set to enforced, then drivers, glxgi, pvscsi, vsepflt, and vsock might generate the event log warnings similar to the following.

  Log Name:      Microsoft-Windows-CodeIntegrity/Operational
   Source:        Microsoft-Windows-CodeIntegrity

  Operational Log:

  Warnings

  Event ID:      3083
   Level:         Warning

  Description:
   Code Integrity determined kernel module system32\DRIVERS\vsock.sys that did not meet the WHQL requirements is loaded into the system.
   Check with the publisher to see if a WHQL compliant kernel module is available.

  Workaround:

  These warnings are safe to ignore. The drivers load and operate in the normal manner.
* **VMware Tools package fails to complete the installation.**

  While installing VMware Tools by running the setup command, a dialog box appears which displays a progress bar. This dialog box displays the progress of the installation of the VC 2017 redistributable package which is used by VMware Tools. The VC 2017 redistributable package installation does not complete, preventing the launch of the general VMware Tools installation dialog box.

  The VMware Tools installation logs can be found in the temporary folder in the path similar to the following:

   %temp%\vminst.log and %temp%\vmmsi.log

  The issue is observed with Windows Vista Service Pack 2 operating system which has Microsoft Document Explorer 2008 package installed when VMware Tools installs the Microsoft VC 2017 redistributable package.

  Workaround:

  To install VMware Tools,

  1. Uninstall the Microsoft Document Explorer 2008 package from the Windows Vista Service Pack 2 operating system.
  2. Install or upgrade VMware Tools by running the setup again.
* **Installing or upgrading versions earlier than VMware Tools 10.3.0 to VMware Tools 11.0.0 might take longer and Windows OS might need a restart.**

  Installation process might appear to be in progress and displays a message similar to the following:
   ​ "Preparing 'VMware Tools' for installation..."

  During this process, the user might be prompted to restart the operating system.

  Workaround:

  For more information, see [KB 55798](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/55798).
* **Drag functionality fails to work in Ubuntu.**

  Drag functionality fails to work in Ubuntu 16.04.4 32-bit virtual machine installed using easy install. Also, failure of copy and paste functionality is observed in the same system.

  Note: This issue is applicable for VMware Tools running on Workstation and Fusion.

  Workaround:

  + Add the modprobe.blacklist=vmwgfx linux kernel boot option.
  + To gain access to larger resolutions, remove svga.guestBackedPrimaryAware = "TRUE" option from the VMX file.
* **Shared Folders mount is unavailable on Linux VM.**

  If the **Shared Folders** feature is enabled on a Linux VM while it is powered off, shared folders mount is not available on restart.

  Note: This issue is applicable for VMware Tools running on Workstation and Fusion.

  Workaround:

  If the VM is powered on, disable and enable the **Shared Folders** feature from the interface.
   For resolving the issue permanently, edit **/etc/fstab** and add an entry to mount the Shared Folders automatically on boot.
   For example, add the line:
   vmhgfs-fuse   /mnt/hgfs    fuse    defaults,allow\_other    0    0

#### Issue/Introduction

Symptoms:
CVE-2020-3941 has been determined to affect VMware Tools on Windows version 10.x.y. This vulnerability and its impact on VMware products are documented in [VMSA-2020-0002](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0002.html). Please review this advisory before continuing as there may be considerations outside the scope of this document.

The VMware Tools team has investigated CVE-2020-3941 and determined that the possibility of exploitation can be removed by performing the steps detailed in the Workaround section of this article.

#### Resolution

This issue is resolved in VMware Tools 11.0.0 and later, available at [VMware Downloads](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?downloadGroup=VMTOOLS1100&productId=742).

Workaround:
To remediate this issue, it is recommended to upgrade VMware Tools to 11.0.0 or later.
However, if upgrading is not possible, exploitation of this issue can be prevented by correcting the ACLs on C:\ProgramData\VMware\VMware CAF directory in the Windows guests running VMware Tools 10.x.y versions. In order to correct ACLs for this directory, remove all write access permissions for Standard User from the directory.

To correct ACLs for this directory:

1. Disable inheritance, remove all inherited permissions, grant “Full control” to local System account and Administrators group
2. Correct the ACL from the Windows UI via Properties of the directory
