Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to a specific REST API in Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability. This allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory structure.
- Insufficient input validation. The API does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for malicious path manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the affected system.
- This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker, utilizing the network.
- The attacker sends a crafted request to the vulnerable REST API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a low-privileged account on the affected Cisco DCNM system.
- The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable API.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco DCNM software releases earlier than 11.4(1).
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate the issue.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability in release 11.4(1) and later.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- There is no public knowledge of any malicious use of the vulnerability.
- The CVSS score is 5.3 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating a medium severity.
