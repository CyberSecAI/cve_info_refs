Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3346:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) web UI not properly validating user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. This means that the attacker's malicious script is injected into the web page and executed when a user interacts with the crafted link.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The web UI fails to adequately validate or sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the affected web UI.
*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** The attacker could potentially access sensitive browser-based information, such as cookies or session tokens.
*   **Data manipulation:** The attacker could modify the content of the page viewed by the victim.
*   **Redirection:** The attacker could redirect the victim to another malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The attacker does not need prior access to the system and can initiate the attack from a remote location.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires the victim to click on a crafted link, which contains the malicious script. This is a typical characteristic of reflected XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting Malicious Links:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious link containing the XSS payload.
*   **Persuading User to Click:** The attacker needs to convince a user of the affected web interface to click the crafted link. This could be done via email, social engineering, or other methods.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco Unified CM and Cisco Unified CM SME versions 10.5(2), 11.5(1), 12.0(1) and 12.5(1).
*   **Fixes:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability, but specific information is in the bug ID details [CSCvt01170](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt01170)
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.1, rated as MEDIUM severity, with a vector string CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.
* The provided document also mentions that Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
