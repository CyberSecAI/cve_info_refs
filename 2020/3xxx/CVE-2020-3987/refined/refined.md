- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the EMR STRETCHDIBITS parser of the Cortado ThinPrint component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor with normal access to a virtual machine can potentially cause a partial denial-of-service condition or leak memory from the TPView process running on the system where Workstation or Horizon Client for Windows is installed.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor with normal access to a virtual machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have normal user access to a virtual machine, and virtual printing must be enabled. Virtual printing is not enabled by default on Workstation, but is enabled by default on Horizon Client.
