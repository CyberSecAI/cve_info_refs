Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3550

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the `sfmgr` daemon of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is a directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22). The software fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input that includes file paths.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an authenticated, remote attacker to perform directory traversal and access directories outside the restricted path on an `sftunnel`-connected peer device. This could enable the attacker to read or write arbitrary files, leading to potential data breaches, system compromise or privilege escalation on the affected peer device.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker exploits this vulnerability by sending specific `sfmgr` commands containing relative path sequences (e.g., `../`) to traverse the file system.
    *   The attack can be carried out remotely.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated on a system that can connect via `sftunnel` to the vulnerable peer device.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted `sfmgr` commands.

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software
*   Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
*   Devices running FTD software are vulnerable only if registered to an FMC

**Unaffected Products:**

*   Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software
*  Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) Software

**Additional Information:**

*   There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released free software updates to address this issue.
*   The vulnerability was discovered through internal security testing.
*   The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.

**CVSS Score:**

*   Base Score: 8.1 (High)
*   CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

This indicates a high severity vulnerability due to the potential for significant impact and ease of exploitation.
