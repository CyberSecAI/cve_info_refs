- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ROMMON in Cisco IOS XE Software allows special parameters to be passed during the initial boot process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of boot-time parameters in ROMMON leading to privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate from a *Priv15* user to the *root* user, enabling arbitrary command execution with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must be able to send parameters to the device during the initial boot-up sequence.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local attacker with *Priv15* access to the device is required. The attacker must have the ability to interact with the device during its initial boot process to send malicious parameters.
