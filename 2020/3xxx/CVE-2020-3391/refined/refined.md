Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Insecure storage of unencrypted credentials on affected Cisco DNA Center devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Credentials stored in clear text, making them easily accessible.
- Information Disclosure due to lack of encryption for sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could view network device configurations and obtain credentials they shouldn't have access to.
- These credentials could be used to discover and manage network devices.
- Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access and control over network devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker.
- Requires an authenticated session to the affected Cisco DNA Center.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the affected Cisco DNA Center.
- The attacker must have the ability to view network device configurations within the system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco DNA Center releases earlier than 1.2.10.
- There are no workarounds available; the only solution is to upgrade to version 1.2.10 or later.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- No public announcements or known malicious use of this vulnerability have been reported.
