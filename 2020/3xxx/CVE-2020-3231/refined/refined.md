Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3231:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists because broadcast traffic received on an 802.1X-enabled port is mishandled by Cisco IOS software on Catalyst 2960-L Series and CDB-8P switches.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of broadcast traffic on 802.1X-enabled ports.
- 802.1x authentication bypass.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can send and receive broadcast traffic on the 802.1X-enabled port before being authenticated.
- Could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the network through broadcast based protocols.

**Attack vectors:**
- Adjacent attacker sending broadcast traffic on a vulnerable switch port.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same local network segment as the vulnerable switch, i.e., be adjacent to the affected switch.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Catalyst 2960-L Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst CDB-8P Switches running vulnerable versions of Cisco IOS Software with 802.1X port-based authentication configured.
