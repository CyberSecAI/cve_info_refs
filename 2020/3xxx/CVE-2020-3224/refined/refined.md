Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3224:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation of specific HTTP requests in the web-based user interface (web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection:  The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary IOS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Configuration Alteration:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to alter the device configuration.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation can lead to a denial of service condition on the affected device.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The injected commands will execute with a higher privilege level.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Network-Based:** The attacker sends specially crafted HTTP requests to a vulnerable web UI endpoint.
- Requires an authenticated user, albeit one with read-only privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to reach the web UI of the affected Cisco IOS XE Software device over the network.
- The attacker needs to have valid credentials for accessing the web UI. Although only read-only privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The device must have the web UI enabled. This can be verified using `show running-config | include ip http server|secure|active`

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted HTTP requests to specific web UI endpoints on the affected device.
- The advisory also provides information on how to determine if the HTTP server feature is enabled on a Cisco device.
- It specifies that the vulnerability is not exploitable over HTTP if the configuration also contains `ip http active-session-modules none` and not exploitable over HTTPS if the configuration also contains `ip http secure-active-session-modules none`.
- No workarounds are available but disabling the HTTP Server feature can be used as a mitigation.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- The provided CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`, which confirms the high severity of the vulnerability.
