##### **1. Impacted Products**

VMware vRealize Log Insight

##### **2. Introduction**

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and Open Redirect vulnerabilities in vRealize Log Insight were privately reported to the VMware Security Response Center. Updates are available to remediate these vulnerabilities in vRealize Log Insight.

##### **3a. Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in vRealize Log Insight due to improper Input validation (CVE-2020-3953)**

**Description**

vRealize Log Insight does not properly validate user input, resulting in XSS vulnerabilities. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Important severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [8.4](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Known Attack Vectors**

A malicious actor with permissions equivalent to the predefined 'user' role may be able to add a malicious payload via the Log Insight UI which would be executed when the victim (another user or administrator) views this data in the UI (Stored XSS). Successful exploitation of this issue may result in a compromise of the victim's workstation.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2020-3953 apply the updates listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' below.

**Workarounds**

None.

**Additional Documentation**

None.

**Notes**

None.

##### **3b. Open Redirect vulnerability in vRealize Log Insight due to improper Input validation (CVE-2020-3954)**

**Description**

vRealize Log Insight does not properly validate user input, resulting in an Open Redirect vulnerability. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Moderate severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [6.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).

**Known Attack Vectors**

A malicious actor may be able to perform a phishing attack by sending a seemingly trusted URL for a vRLI deployment to a victim. Upon opening this URL the victim will be redirected to a location of the attacker's choosing. Successful exploitation of this issue may result in a compromise of the victim's workstation.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2020-3954 apply the updates listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' below.

**Workarounds**

None.

**Additional Documentation**

None.

**Notes**

None.
