"text": "These vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software:\r\n\r\nCisco 809 and 829 Industrial ISRs\r\nCGR1000\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nNote: Cisco 800 Series Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices are designed on a hypervisor architecture, where Cisco IOS Software, a Guest Operating System (Guest OS), and a Virtual Device Server (VDS) run as separate virtual machines (VMs). Cisco IOS Software and Guest OS need to access some shared devices. Examples are embedded multimedia card (eMMC) flash memory, USB ports, and the console. VDS coordinates access to the shared devices and provides communication channels between VMs over emulated Ethernet interfaces.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS Software and VDS perform inter-VM signaling and control operations by establishing a UDP channel on UDP port 9700. Signaling packets are not restricted���they are not processed only when they are sent to internal, local communications between VMs. Instead, an affected system will accept and process signaling packets from any interface of an affected device. The impacts of successful exploitation are described in the Details [\"#details\"] section of this advisory."

"text": "Two vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker or an authenticated local attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system or cause an affected device to crash and reload.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities reside either in the area of code that manages inter-VM signaling or in one of the diagnostic test CLI commands of Cisco IOS Software for the affected products.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability.\r\n Vulnerability Details\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS Software for Cisco Industrial Routers Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the area of code that manages inter-VM signaling of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system or cause an affected system to crash and reload.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain values in packets that are destined for UDP port 9700 of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely execute code in the context of the Cisco IOS Software VM that is running on an affected system or cause an affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by using malicious UDP packets over either IPv4 or IPv6. The malicious packets must be destined to and processed by an affected device; traffic transiting a device will not trigger the vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvr12083 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr12083\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2020-3198\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Critical\r\nCVSS Base Score: 9.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nMitigation for CVE-2020-3198\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCustomers can reduce the attack surface by restricting inbound traffic destined for UDP port 9700 of an affected device by implementing an access control list (ACL) or infrastructure access control list (iACL). This may be a suitable mitigation until affected devices can be upgraded. Information about access lists is in Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices. [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html\"] Information about iACLs is in Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/43920-iacl.html\"].\r\n\r\nCisco IOS Software for Cisco Industrial Routers Test CLI Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in one of the diagnostic test CLI commands of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The attacker must have valid user credentials at privilege level 15.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because, under specific circumstances, the affected software permits modification of the device's run-time memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and issuing a specific diagnostic test command at the CLI. A successful exploit could trigger a logic error in the code that was designed to restrict run-time memory modifications. The attacker could take advantage of this logic error to overwrite system memory locations and execute arbitrary code on an affected device.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvr46885 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr46885\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2020-3258\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 5.7\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"

"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n Cisco IOS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco IOS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (���First Fixed���). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS Software release���for example, 15.1(4)M2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search."

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-iot-rce-xYRSeMNH>  This advisory is part of the June 3, 2020, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 23 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 25 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: June 2020 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-73388).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software:    + Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial ISRs   + CGR1000 For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Note:** Cisco 800 Series Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices are designed on a hypervisor architecture, where Cisco IOS Software, a Guest Operating System (Guest OS), and a Virtual Device Server (VDS) run as separate virtual machines (VMs). Cisco IOS Software and Guest OS need to access some shared devices. Examples are embedded multimedia card (eMMC) flash memory, USB ports, and the console. VDS coordinates access to the shared devices and provides communication channels between VMs over emulated Ethernet interfaces.  Cisco IOS Software and VDS perform inter-VM signaling and control operations by establishing a UDP channel on UDP port 9700. Signaling packets are not restricted-they are not processed only when they are sent to internal, local communications between VMs. Instead, an affected system will accept and process signaling packets from any interface of an affected device. The impacts of successful exploitation are described in the [Details](#details) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco products:    + 800 Series ISRs   + 807 Industrial ISRs   + IOS XE Software   + IOS XR Software   + NX-OS Software  Details  * Two vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker or an authenticated local attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system or cause an affected device to crash and reload.  These vulnerabilities reside either in the area of code that manages inter-VM signaling or in one of the diagnostic test CLI commands of Cisco IOS Software for the affected products.  The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. Vulnerability Details Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.  **Cisco IOS Software for Cisco Industrial Routers Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the area of code that manages inter-VM signaling of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system or cause an affected system to crash and reload. The vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain values in packets that are destined for UDP port 9700 of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely execute code in the context of the Cisco IOS Software VM that is running on an affected system or cause an affected device to reload.  This vulnerability can be exploited by using malicious UDP packets over either IPv4 or IPv6. The malicious packets must be destined to and processed by an affected device; traffic transiting a device will not trigger the vulnerability.  Bug ID(s): [CSCvr12083](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr12083)CVE ID: CVE-2020-3198Security Impact Rating (SIR): CriticalCVSS Base Score: 9.8CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  *Mitigation for CVE-2020-3198*  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Customers can reduce the attack surface by restricting inbound traffic destined for UDP port 9700 of an affected device by implementing an access control list (ACL) or infrastructure access control list (iACL). This may be a suitable mitigation until affected devices can be upgraded. Information about access lists is in [Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html) Information about iACLs is in [Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/43920-iacl.html).  **Cisco IOS Software for Cisco Industrial Routers Test CLI Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in one of the diagnostic test CLI commands of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The attacker must have valid user credentials at privilege level 15.  The vulnerability exists because, under specific circumstances, the affected software permits modification of the device's run-time memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and issuing a specific diagnostic test command at the CLI. A successful exploit could trigger a logic error in the code that was designed to restrict run-time memory modifications. The attacker could take advantage of this logic error to overwrite system memory locations and execute arbitrary code on an affected device.Bug ID(s): [CSCvr46885](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr46885)CVE ID: CVE-2020-3258Security Impact Rating (SIR): MediumCVSS Base Score: 5.7CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  Cisco IOS Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco IOS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.  Customers can use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2**:       By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR).

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 9.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.
