Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-3769:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is that Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is vulnerable to SSRF. This means the application can be tricked into making requests to internal or external resources on behalf of the attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to sensitive information disclosure. This implies that an attacker could potentially gain access to data or resources that should not be publicly accessible through the AEM server.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through manipulating the application to send crafted requests. An attacker would need to manipulate the AEM instance into making requests to attacker-controlled or unintended destinations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable AEM instance and control the destination or parameters of server-side requests made by the AEM instance. It is not explicitly stated whether this requires prior authentication, but the nature of SSRF typically means that the attacker is using the AEM server as a proxy which is why such attacks can bypass network firewalls or security configurations.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects AEM versions 6.5 and below.
*   Adobe has released updates to address this issue.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important".
*   The content references specific AEM versions and fix packs that address this vulnerability:
