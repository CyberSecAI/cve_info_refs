Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3267

**Root Cause:** Insufficient authorization enforcement in the API subsystem of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Authorization:** The system fails to properly validate the authorization of API requests, allowing an authenticated user to perform actions they should not be permitted to do.
*   **API Vulnerability:** Specific API calls can be crafted with malicious input to exploit the authorization flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can change the availability state of agents, potentially disrupting contact center operations and preventing agents from receiving calls.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker with valid agent credentials can manipulate other agent states beyond their intended access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **API Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by making a specific API call with crafted input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid agent credentials on the affected system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the affected Cisco Unified CCX system to make the API requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Unified CCX software releases earlier than Release 12.5(1).
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability. Release 12.5(1) and later contains the fix.
*   There are no workarounds available for this vulnerability.
