| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS Software for Cisco Industrial Routers Virtual Device Server Inter-VM Channel Command Injection Vulnerability Critical   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-ios-iot-udp-vds-inj-f2D5Jzrt  First Published: 2020 June 3 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvq66443](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvq66443)     CVE-2020-3205     CWE-20       CVSS Score: [Base 8.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2020-3205     CWE-20       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-iot-udp-vds-inj-f2D5Jzrt/csaf/cisco-sa-ios-iot-udp-vds-inj-f2D5Jzrt.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the implementation of the inter-VM channel of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) and Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers (CGR1000) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Virtual Device Server (VDS) of an affected device.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of signaling packets that are destined to VDS. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the Linux shell of VDS with the privileges of the *root* user. Because the device is designed on a hypervisor architecture, exploitation of a vulnerability that affects the inter-VM channel may lead to a complete system compromise.  For more information about this vulnerability, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-iot-udp-vds-inj-f2D5Jzrt>  This advisory is part of the June 3, 2020, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 23 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 25 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: June 2020 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-73388).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software:    + Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial ISRs   + CGR1000 For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + 800 Series ISRs   + 807 Industrial ISRs   + IOS XE Software   + IOS XR Software   + NX-OS Software  Details  * Cisco 800 Series Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices are designed on a hypervisor architecture, where Cisco IOS Software, a Guest Operating System (Guest OS), and VDS run as separate virtual machines (VMs). Cisco IOS Software and Guest OS need to access some shared devices. Examples are embedded multimedia card (eMMC) flash memory, USB ports, and the console. VDS coordinates access to the shared devices and provides communication channels between VMs over emulated Ethernet interfaces.  Cisco IOS Software and VDS perform inter-VM signaling and control operations over a UDP channel on UDP port 9700. The attacker could gain full control of the VDS and compromise the system completely because signaling packets are not restricted-they are not processed only when they are sent to internal, local communications between VMs. Instead, an affected system will accept and process signaling packets from any interface of an affected device. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain full control of VDS, which could lead to a complete system compromise, including compromise of the Cisco IOS Software VM and the Guest OS VM.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Customers can reduce the attack surface by restricting inbound traffic destined for UDP port 9700 of an affected device by implementing an access control list (ACL) or infrastructure access control list (iACL). This may be a suitable mitigation until affected devices can be upgraded. Information about access lists is in [Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html) Information about iACLs is in [Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/43920-iacl.html).  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  Cisco IOS Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco IOS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.  Customers can use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2**:       By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search.    Fixed Releases for All VDS-Related Vulnerabilities in This Bundle of Advisories This release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication contains multiple advisories for vulnerabilities that affect VDS. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution for these vulnerabilities, administrators are advised to upgrade affected devices to a fixed software release that addresses all VDS-related advisories in this bundled publication:    + [cisco-sa-ios-iot-udp-vds-inj-f2D5Jzrt](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-iot-udp-vds-inj-f2D5Jzrt)   + [cisco-sa-ios-iot-vds-cmd-inj-VfJtqGhE](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-iot-vds-cmd-inj-VfJtqGhE)   + [cisco-sa-ios-iot-vds-cred-uPMp9zbY](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-iot-vds-cred-uPMp9zbY)   + [cisco-sa-ios-ir800-img-verif-wHhLYHjK](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-ir800-img-verif-wHhLYHjK)  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.8 |
