Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of arguments passed to a specific CLI command within Cisco FXOS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: Malicious input included as an argument of the affected CLI command is not properly sanitized or validated, leading to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Command Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system.
- Root Privileges: The executed commands run with root privileges, granting the attacker complete control over the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker must have local access to the affected device.
- CLI Access: The attacker needs to interact with the CLI interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Administrator: The attacker must possess valid administrator credentials to access and interact with the CLI.
- Local Access: The attacker must have local access to the device.

**Summary:**
This is a command injection vulnerability in the Cisco FXOS Software CLI. A local attacker with administrator privileges can inject malicious commands via a specific CLI command due to insufficient input validation. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying Linux system.
