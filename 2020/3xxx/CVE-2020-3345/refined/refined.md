Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3345:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to improper checks on parameter values within certain web pages of Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco Webex Meetings Server. This lack of proper input validation allows for HTML injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary HTML code into affected web page parameters. This is a type of input validation vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Web Page Modification:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to modify the content of a web page within the user's browser.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** The attacker can alter the web page to redirect users to potentially malicious websites, leading to phishing or malware distribution.
*   **Client-Side Attacks:**  The injected HTML can be used to further conduct client-side attacks, such as JavaScript execution, potentially leading to more severe compromises (e.g., session hijacking, data theft).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Links:** The attack vector is through crafted links that, when clicked by a user, pass the malicious HTML code into the vulnerable web page parameters.
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker can be remote and does not require prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user needs to be persuaded to click on the crafted link for the exploit to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be located remotely.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not require prior access or authentication to the Webex system.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must be able to convince a user to click on a malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Webex Meetings releases earlier than 40.6.0 and Cisco Webex Meetings Server releases earlier than 4.0 MR3.
*   There are no workarounds available.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this issue (versions 40.6.0 and later for Webex Meetings, 4.0 MR3 and later for Webex Meetings Server).
*   The vulnerability is classified as medium severity with a CVSS base score of 4.3.
*   The CVSS vector string is: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
*   Multiple researchers are credited with reporting the vulnerability.
