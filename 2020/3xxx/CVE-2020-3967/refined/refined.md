Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-3967:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow present in the USB 2.0 controller (EHCI) component of VMware products. The root cause is a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a heap-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** Specifically, the vulnerability occurs because the EHCI component doesn't correctly check the size of data provided by a guest virtual machine before copying it to a heap-allocated buffer. This allows writing data beyond the allocated buffer's bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit can lead to an attacker escalating their privileges from the guest OS to the hypervisor.
- **Code Execution:**  By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite adjacent memory and achieve arbitrary code execution within the hypervisor's context. This effectively allows the attacker to gain control of the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to a virtual machine to exploit this vulnerability.
- **High-Privileged Code Execution (Initial):** According to the ZDI advisory, the attacker must already have the ability to execute high-privileged code within the guest operating system in order to leverage the heap overflow. The VMware advisory indicates that additional conditions beyond the attacker's control need to be present for exploitation to be possible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must have the ability to execute code within a virtual machine.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the virtual machine's USB subsystem to trigger the vulnerable code in the EHCI controller.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion products.
- VMware has provided patches to address this vulnerability.
- A workaround involves removing the USB controller from the virtual machine.

**CVSS Score:**
- The CVSS v3 base score is 8.1, with the vector string being AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H. This reflects a local attack, high complexity, no required privileges or user interaction, a changed scope, and high impacts to confidentiality, integrity and availability.

The information from the ZDI advisory provides more specifics on the initial requirement of needing to execute high-privileged code in the guest to then leverage the heap overflow for privilege escalation to the hypervisor.
