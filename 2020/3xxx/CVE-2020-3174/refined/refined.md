Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3174:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper validation of received gratuitous ARP (GARP) requests within the anycast gateway feature of Cisco NX-OS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The software fails to properly validate the content of received GARP packets. This lack of validation allows for the injection of malicious data.
*   **ARP Table Corruption:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject invalid or malicious ARP entries into the device's ARP table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Traffic Disruption:** By corrupting the ARP table with incorrect entries (particularly non-local IP addresses), an attacker can redirect or disrupt network traffic.
*   **Potential Man-in-the-Middle:** While not explicitly stated, corrupting the ARP table could allow an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Network:** The attacker must be on the same local subnet as the vulnerable device.
*   **Malicious GARP Packets:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending malicious GARP packets to the targeted Cisco device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Adjacent Network Access:** The attacker must have access to the local subnet where the vulnerable Cisco device is located.
*   **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs the capability to craft and send malicious GARP packets.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 3000, 7000, and 9000 Series switches running vulnerable versions of NX-OS Software with the anycast gateway feature enabled.
*   No workarounds are available.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   Administrators can check for signs of compromise by using the `show ip arp detail` command and looking for non-local IP addresses in the ARP table.
