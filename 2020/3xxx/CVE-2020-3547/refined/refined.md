Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3547:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an insecure method used to mask certain passwords within the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure password masking: The web interface does not properly protect password data, making it accessible via inspecting the HTML code.
- Information Disclosure: Passwords configured in the web interface can be revealed through the insecure masking method.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could obtain some of the passwords configured within the Cisco SMA and WSA web-based management interface.
- This could lead to further unauthorized access or compromise of the affected systems, depending on the privileges associated with the revealed passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, via the network, through the web-based management interface.
- The vulnerability is exploited by examining the raw HTML code received from the interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated, with at least low-level privileges to access the web-based management interface.
- Remote access to the vulnerable system is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) and Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), both physical and virtual.
- Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) is confirmed to be not vulnerable.
