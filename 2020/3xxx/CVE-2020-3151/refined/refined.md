Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient security mechanisms in the restricted shell implementation of Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient security in restricted shell:** The restricted shell does not properly prevent command execution that should be blocked.
*   **Bypass of CLI restrictions:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass intended limitations within the CLI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escaping restricted shell:** Successful exploitation enables the attacker to escape the restricted CLI.
*   **Unauthorized command execution:** After escaping the shell, the attacker can execute commands normally unavailable to them.
*   **Non-root user privileges:** The attacker gains the privileges of a non-root user to execute these unauthorized commands.
*   **Confidentiality Impact (High), Integrity Impact (Low):** An attacker can gain access to sensitive data (High Confidentiality impact), and to a lesser degree make changes to the system (Low Integrity impact). Availability is not affected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Crafted Commands:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted commands to the CLI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Credentials:** The attacker must have valid administrative credentials to access the CLI.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**
CVE-2020-3151 is a medium severity vulnerability due to insufficient security measures in the restricted shell of Cisco CMX that enables a locally authenticated attacker to bypass the restricted shell and execute unauthorized commands with non-root privileges through crafted commands.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco CMX releases 10.6.0, 10.6.1, and 10.6.2 are affected.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability (refer to the bug ID CSCvr98342 for details).
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.1 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N. This translates to: Local attack vector, Low complexity, High privileges required, no user interaction, Unchanged scope, High confidentiality impact, Low integrity impact, and no availability impact.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-287, which deals with improper authentication.
