Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3166:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is due to **insufficient input validation** in the Cisco FXOS Software CLI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Arbitrary File Read/Write:** The primary weakness is the ability to read and write arbitrary files on the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful exploit could allow an attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the underlying OS. This could lead to:
    *   **Confidentiality breach:** Reading sensitive files could expose confidential data.
    *  **Integrity breach:** Writing malicious files could corrupt the system or introduce backdoors.
    *  **Availability impact:** Writing to critical files could cause system instability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local access:** The vulnerability can only be exploited by a local attacker.
*   **CLI command:** The attacker needs to use a specific CLI command with crafted arguments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the CLI.
*   **Local access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable FXOS software is running.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Firepower appliances running vulnerable versions of Cisco FXOS software.
*   No workarounds are available to mitigate the vulnerability, upgrading to a fixed release is the only solution.

**CVSS Score:**
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 4.2, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L. This indicates that it is a medium severity vulnerability, with local attack vector, low attack complexity, and high privileges required.
