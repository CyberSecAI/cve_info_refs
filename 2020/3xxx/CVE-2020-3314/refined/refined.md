Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3314:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from **insufficient input validation of specific file attributes** during the file scan process of the Cisco AMP for Endpoints Mac Connector Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The software fails to properly validate file attributes, leading to a crash when encountering a crafted file.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to crash the AMP scan engine, leading to a restart of the connector, and potentially repeated crashes, resulting in a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Service Crash:** A successful exploit causes the Cisco AMP for Endpoints service to crash.
- **Missed Detection & Logging:** The crash results in the service missing the detection and logging of potentially malicious files.
- **Denial of Service:** Continued attempts to scan the crafted file could lead to a denial of service condition of the Cisco AMP for Endpoints service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted File:** An attacker needs to provide a crafted file to a user of an affected system.
- **User Interaction:** The user must interact with the crafted file, likely by having the AMP software scan it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Crafted File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a file with specific attributes that trigger the vulnerability.
- **File Delivery:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the crafted file to a user of a vulnerable system. This could be via email, a website, or any other method that allows a user to interact with the file on their machine.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need to have any special privileges on the target system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction Required:** The user must initiate the scan of the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Cisco AMP for Endpoints Mac Connector Software releases earlier than Release 1.12.3.738.
- There are no workarounds available.
- The vulnerability was discovered through internal security testing.
- There is no public announcement or malicious use of this vulnerability known by Cisco.
- Cisco has released a software update to address the issue.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.1 which indicates a medium severity.
