  {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2020-3963",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The paravirtualized NVRAM device (PVNVRAM) stores a raw pointer to the last returned variable during find-next operations. In the write operation (opcode 0xD3), when updating or deleting an existing variable, this pointer is not cleared, leading to a dangling pointer.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-after-free (UAF)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor with local access to a virtual machine may be able to read privileged information contained in hypervisor memory from a virtual machine.",
    "Attack vectors": "The UAF is triggered from the guest OS using find-next operation after performing write operation on NVRAM variables.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires local access to the virtual machine."
  }
