You can remove a USB controller from the virtual machine if you do not want to connect to USB devices.

## Prerequisites

Note: The
ESXi host supports hot-removal of a USB controller. You can remove a USB controller from a virtual machine when both the
ESXi host and the guest operating system of the virtual machine support the hot-removal functionality.

To make sure that the guest operating system of the virtual machine supports the hot-removal functionality, refer to the vendors documentation.

* Verify that the USB controller is not in use.
* Verify that all USB devices are disconnected from the virtual machine.
* Required privilege: Virtual Machine.Configuration.Add or Remove Device

## Procedure

1. Navigate to and select a data center, folder, cluster, resource pool, host, or vApp, click the VMs tab and click Virtual Machines. Alternatively, you can navigate to and select directly the virtual machine.
2. Right-click a virtual machine and click Edit Settings.
3. On the Virtual Hardware tab, move the pointer over the USB controller and click the Remove icon.
4. Click OK to confirm the deletion and close the dialog box.

## Results

The controller is no longer connected to the virtual machine, but remains available to add at a later time.

# VMware ESXi: Multiple vulnerabilities [CVE-2020-3963, CVE-2020-3964, CVE-2020-3965, CVE-2020-3960]

---

*From*: Cfir Cohen via Fulldisclosure <fulldisclosure () seclists org>

```
Overview
=======
We identified several security issues in the ESIx virtual machine
monitor (VMM): a use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in PVNVRAM, a
missing return value check in EHCI USB controller leading to private
heap information disclosure, and several OOB reads.

All issues have been fixed by the vendor. Links to the patches are
provided below.

ESXi PVNVRAM Use After Free [CVE-2020-3963]
======================================
The paravirtualized NVRAM device supports read / write / find-next
operations on variables stored in its variables store.

The find-next operation (opcode 0xD2) allows guest firmware to
enumerate all variables in the store by querying for the next variable
in the store. PVNVRAM stores a raw pointer to the last returned
variable. In most places that update the variable store, this pointer
is properly cleared, however, in the write operation (opcode 0xD3),
there’s a flow that updates / deletes an existing variable, where this
last_search_value pointer is not cleared.

This leads to a situation where the dangling pointer is used in
subsequent find-next operations. We were able to trigger this UAF from
the guest, and confirmed (using gdb) that the dangling pointer is
indeed used after free.

<https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0015.html>

ESXi EHCI qTD data leak [CVE-2020-3964]
=================================
The EHCI USB controller processes queue element transfer descriptors
(qTD), as described in section 3.5 of the EHCI specification. We found
that the implementation in this case processes guest-controlled qTDs.

Each descriptor has up to 5 buffer pointers that together hold the USB
request block (URB):

+---------Queue Element Transfer Descriptor Block    +
|                Next qTD pointer            | 0 | T |
|        Alternate Next qTD Pointer          | 0 | T |
| Total Bytes to Transfer | C_Page | Cerr |  Status  |
| Buffer Pointer (page 0)          |  Current Offset |
| Buffer Pointer (page 1)          |     Reserved    |
| Buffer Pointer (page 2)          |     Reserved    |
| Buffer Pointer (page 3)          |     Reserved    |
| Buffer Pointer (page 4)          |     Reserved    |
+----------------------------------------------------+

The function EhciReadTDBuffer() (name identified from log string)
reads the URB contents into a heap allocated buffer. Unfortunately,
the return value of ReadBytes is not checked. A guest can cause this
function to fail by passing a GPA value of zero (or, in the 64bit
addressing case, a non-canonical address >= 0x8000’0000'0000). This
leads to a case where an attached USB device processes a URB with
uninitialized heap data.

We successfully exploited this to leak VMM heap data by sending a SCSI
WRITE command to a USB mass storage device.

Writes to a USB mass storage device are encoded in two qTDs: the first
holds the SCSI WRITE header, and the second holds the data to be
written.

For example, the following operations in the guest:

$ perl -e "print 'a'x2000;" > aaaa
$ sudo dd if=aaaa of=/dev/sdb1 bs=512 count=8

Result in the following qTDs:

#
# First qTD of size 0x1f:
#  "USBC" signature is the CBW packet header set by
#  usb_stor_Bulk_transport() in drivers/usb/storage/transport.c.
#
#  0x2A is SCSI WRITE (10) command in the CDB buffer.
#  0x08 is the transfer length in sectors (8 * 0x200 = 0x1000).
#
Thread 1 hit Breakpoint 1, xxxx in ?? ()
EhciReadTDBuffer, buffer pointer 1 = 34a89000, size = 1f

#

Thread 1 hit Breakpoint 2, xxxx in ?? ()

0x65e1730:  0x61    0x61    0x61    0x61    0x61    0x61    0x61    0x61
0x65e1738:  0x61    0x61    0x61    0x61    0x61    0x61    0x61    0x61
0x65e1740:  0x61    0x61    0x61    0x61    0x61    0x61    0x61    0x61

By failing ReadBytes() in the second qTD, we write previous heap data
to the disk. We verified VUsb_NewUrb() mallocs the URB buffer, and
doesn’t memset the data buffer to zeros. We confirmed that by reading
back the disk contents, the hypervisor was leaking uninitialized heap
data.

<https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0015.html>

ESXi XHCI OOB read access [CVE-2020-3965]
====================================
XHCI USB controller reads the DCBs from the guest by mapping a guest
page and iterating over values in it based on a bit field value.

There was insufficient validation on the bit field value: the map size
may be out of sync with the loop counter. A guest can supply a size
value of 0x40, with a bit field value of 0xffffffff. This causes the
loop to copy 32 elements out of the mapped page, which is outside the
bounds of the mapped region

<https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0015.html>

ESXi NVME OOB read access [CVE-2020-3960]
==========================================
The NVME controller does not properly handle namespace 0 in the
nvme_admin_identify handler. NSID of 0 minus one underflows and leads
to an OOB read access.

<https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0012.html>

Credits
===========
These vulnerabilities were discovered and reported to VMware by Cfir
Cohen of the Google Cloud security team.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
