Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3563

**Description:**
A vulnerability in the packet processing functionality of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to inefficient memory management within the Cisco FTD software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Inefficient memory management during the processing of TCP packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to exhaust system memory, causing the device to reload unexpectedly.
- This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, making the device temporarily unavailable.
- No manual intervention is required for the device to recover after reloading.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability over the network.
- The attacker sends a large number of TCP packets to a specific port on the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need authentication.
- The attacker requires the ability to send network traffic to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to send a large number of TCP packets to a specific port.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco FTD Software.
- Cisco ASA Software and Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software are not affected.
- No workarounds exist for this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing by Cisco.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 8.6 (High).
