Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied UNIX symbolic links within the processing of tar files by the `LargeFileUploadServlet` endpoint in Cisco UCS Director and UCS Director Express for Big Data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Symlink Following:** The system does not properly validate symbolic links within uploaded tar files before using them in file operations.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The lack of proper validation allows an attacker to manipulate file paths, leading to directory traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write/Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to write or execute arbitrary files on the system.
*   **Remote Code Execution:**  Specifically, the attacker can achieve remote code execution in the context of the tomcat service.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker could gain root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the network.
*  **REST API Endpoint:** The vulnerable endpoint is the `LargeFileUploadServlet` within the REST API of Cisco UCS Director and UCS Director Express for Big Data.
*  **Malicious Tar Files:** The attacker crafts a malicious tar file containing a symbolic link pointing to a location outside the intended upload directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote to the target system.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the REST API to exploit the vulnerability in the `LargeFileUploadServlet` endpoint.

**Additional details:**

*   The ZDI advisory mentions that authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. However, the Cisco advisory specifies that the attacker needs to be authenticated. This discrepancy is not clarified in the provided content.
*   Cisco assigns a CVSS base score of 8.1 to this vulnerability with vector string of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H, whereas ZDI assigns it 9.8 with vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   Proof-of-concept exploit code is publicly available.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in Cisco UCS Director Release 6.7.4.0 and UCS Director Express for Big Data Release 3.7.4.0.
