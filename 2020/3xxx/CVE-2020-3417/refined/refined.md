The provided content is related to CVE-2020-3417.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Incorrect validations by boot scripts when specific ROM monitor (ROMMON) variables are set.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The boot scripts do not properly validate ROMMON variables, allowing an attacker to manipulate them.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of persistent code on the underlying operating system (OS) at boot time.
- Breaking the chain of trust.
- The attacker could gain control of the device by executing arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the device, either through a root shell or physical access.
- Exploiting the vulnerability involves installing code to a specific directory in the underlying OS and setting a specific ROMMON variable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated access to the root shell of the device or physical access to the device.
- Ability to install code to a specific directory and set ROMMON variables.
