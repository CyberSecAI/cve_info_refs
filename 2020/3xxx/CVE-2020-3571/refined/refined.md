Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3571:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation when processing ICMP packets. Specifically, the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software on Cisco Firepower 4110 appliances doesn't properly validate incoming ICMP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incomplete input validation of ICMP packets.
- Susceptibility to memory exhaustion due to processing a high volume of crafted ICMP packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected device.
- Successful exploitation can lead to memory exhaustion, resulting in an unexpected device reload.
- The device automatically recovers after the reload without manual intervention.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a high number of crafted ICMP or ICMPv6 packets to the affected device.
- The attack vector is network based.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is required.
- No user interaction is required.
