- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability in iTunes allowed for arbitrary file overwriting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The code contained a flaw that enabled a malicious application to overwrite arbitrary files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious application could potentially overwrite any files, leading to data loss, system instability, or potentially arbitrary code execution if executable files are targeted.
- **Attack vectors**: This vulnerability is exploitable by a malicious application running on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious application on the targeted macOS system.
