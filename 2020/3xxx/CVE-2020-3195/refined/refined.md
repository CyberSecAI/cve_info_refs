Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3195

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by the incorrect processing of certain Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) packets within Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of crafted OSPF packets.
- Memory leak due to continuous consumption of memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to continuous memory consumption on the affected device.
- This can eventually cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker can send a series of specially crafted OSPF packets to the vulnerable device.
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing these crafted OSPF packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA and FTD software that supports OSPF routing with Link-Local Signaling (LLS) block processing enabled (enabled by default).
- There are no known workarounds available.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- This vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
