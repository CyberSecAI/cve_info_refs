# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-dd0c20d985
2020-07-28 15:00:49.911952
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : clamav
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 0.102.4
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <https://www.clamav.net/>
Summary : End-user tools for the Clam Antivirus scanner
Description :
Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose of this
software is the integration with mail servers (attachment scanning). The
package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command
line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via Internet. The programs
are based on a shared library distributed with the Clam AntiVirus package,
which you can use with your own software. The virus database is based on
the virus database from OpenAntiVirus, but contains additional signatures
(including signatures for popular polymorphic viruses, too) and is KEPT UP
TO DATE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

ClamAV 0.102.4 is a bug patch release to address the following issues:
CVE-2020-3350 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3350>
Fixed a vulnerability a malicious user could exploit to replace a scan target's
directory with a symlink to another path to trick clamscan, clamdscan, or
clamonacc into removing or moving a different file (such as a critical system
file). The issue would affect users that use the --move or --remove options for
clamscan, clamdscan and clamonacc. For more information about AV quarantine
attacks using links, see RACK911 Lab's report
[https://www.rack911labs.com/research/exploiting-almost-every-antivirus-
software](https://www.rack911labs.com/research/exploiting-almost-every-antivirus-%0Asoftware). CVE-2020-3327 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-
bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3327](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-%0Abin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3327) Fixed a vulnerability in the ARJ archive-
parsing module in ClamAV 0.102.3 that could cause a denial-of-service (DoS)
condition. Improper bounds checking resulted in an out-of-bounds read that could
cause a crash. The previous fix for this CVE in version 0.102.3 was incomplete.
This fix correctly resolves the issue. CVE-2020-3481
<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3481> Fixed a
vulnerability in the EGG archive module in ClamAV 0.102.0 - 0.102.3 that could
cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Improper error handling could cause a
crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. This vulnerability is mitigated for
those using the official ClamAV signature databases because the file type
signatures in daily.cvd will not enable the EGG archive parser in affected
versions.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1858261#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2020-07-17 11:36:03 UTC  ``` A vulnerability in the endpoint software of Cisco AMP for Endpoints and Clam AntiVirus could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause the running software to delete arbitrary files on the system. The vulnerability is due to a race condition that could occur when scanning malicious files. An attacker with local shell access could exploit this vulnerability by executing a script that could trigger the race condition. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files on the system that the attacker would not normally have privileges to delete, producing system instability or causing the endpoint software to stop working.

Package        : clamav
Version        : 0.102.4+dfsg-0+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-3327 CVE-2020-3350 CVE-2020-3481

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the ClamAV antivirus toolkit:

CVE-2020-3327

    An out of bounds read in the ARJ archive-parsing module could cause
    denial of service. The fix in 0.102.3 was incomplete.

CVE-2020-3350

    A malicious user could trick clamscan, clamdscan or clamonacc into
    moving or removing a different file than intended when those are
    used with one of the --move or --remove options. This could be used
    to get rid of special system files.

CVE-2020-3481

    The EGG archive module was vulnerable to denial of service via NULL
    pointer dereference due to improper error handling. The official
    signature database avoided this problem because the signatures there
    avoided the use of the EGG archive parser.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
0.102.4+dfsg-0+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.

its security tracker page at:

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-6584a641ae
2020-08-01 00:49:35.658947
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : clamav
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 0.102.4
Release : 1.fc32
URL : <https://www.clamav.net/>
Summary : End-user tools for the Clam Antivirus scanner
Description :
Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose of this
software is the integration with mail servers (attachment scanning). The
package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command
line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via Internet. The programs
are based on a shared library distributed with the Clam AntiVirus package,
which you can use with your own software. The virus database is based on
the virus database from OpenAntiVirus, but contains additional signatures
(including signatures for popular polymorphic viruses, too) and is KEPT UP
TO DATE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

ClamAV 0.102.4 is a bug patch release to address the following issues:
CVE-2020-3350 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3350>
Fixed a vulnerability a malicious user could exploit to replace a scan target's
directory with a symlink to another path to trick clamscan, clamdscan, or
clamonacc into removing or moving a different file (such as a critical system
file). The issue would affect users that use the --move or --remove options for
clamscan, clamdscan and clamonacc. For more information about AV quarantine
attacks using links, see RACK911 Lab's report
[https://www.rack911labs.com/research/exploiting-almost-every-antivirus-
software](https://www.rack911labs.com/research/exploiting-almost-every-antivirus-%0Asoftware). CVE-2020-3327 [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-
bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3327](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-%0Abin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3327) Fixed a vulnerability in the ARJ archive-
parsing module in ClamAV 0.102.3 that could cause a denial-of-service (DoS)
condition. Improper bounds checking resulted in an out-of-bounds read that could
cause a crash. The previous fix for this CVE in version 0.102.3 was incomplete.
This fix correctly resolves the issue. CVE-2020-3481
<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3481> Fixed a
vulnerability in the EGG archive module in ClamAV 0.102.0 - 0.102.3 that could
cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Improper error handling could cause a
crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. This vulnerability is mitigated for
those using the official ClamAV signature databases because the file type
signatures in daily.cvd will not enable the EGG archive parser in affected
versions.

The vulnerability is due to a race condition that could occur when scanning malicious files. An attacker with local shell access could exploit this vulnerability by executing a script that could trigger the race condition. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files on the system that the attacker would not normally have privileges to delete, producing system instability or causing the endpoint software to stop working.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-famp-ZEpdXy>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following products prior to the first fixed release:    + Cisco AMP for Endpoints (MacOS and Linux)   + ClamAV This vulnerability cannot be exploited on endpoints that are using Audit Policy Mode.  See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Impact on Cisco AMP for Endpoints (Windows) Cisco bug ID CSCvt98752 has been raised to investigate the full impact on the Windows Connector of the proof-of-concept exploit code for this vulnerability. The methods described in the RACK911 publication (described in [Source](#source)) cannot be used to force the Windows Connector to quarantine files that are loaded into a process or as a process. However, they can impact supporting files that are necessary for the continued operation of the Connector. The team is investigating potential solutions to address this issue. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Email Security Appliances (ESA)   + Web Security Appliances (WSA)   + Immunet  Details  * Cisco AMP for Endpoints contains a feature known as guardrails to prevent accidentally blocking or quarantining legitimate applications and operating system components. This vulnerability involves a tight race condition in which the guardrails feature could be bypassed.  Although Cisco ESA and Cisco WSA are not affected, they can be used to integrate with third-party antivirus engines. Those engines should be upgraded to a fixed version of software by the corresponding antivirus provider.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases At the time of publication, this vulnerability was fixed in the following versions (and later):    + Cisco AMP for Endpoints - Linux version 1.12.4   + Cisco AMP for Endpoints - MacOS version 1.12.4   + ClamAV version 0.103 and 0.102.4 See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 5.5 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 5.5 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 5.5 |
