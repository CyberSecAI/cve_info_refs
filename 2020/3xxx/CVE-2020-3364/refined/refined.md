Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3364

**Root Cause:** A logic error in Cisco IOS XR Software prevents Access Control Lists (ACLs) from working correctly when applied to the standby route processor management interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **ACL Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of configured ACLs on the standby route processor management Gigabit Ethernet interface. Due to a logic error, the ACLs are ineffective on this interface.
*   **Improper Access Control:** The software fails to enforce the intended access restrictions, allowing unauthorized access to the standby route processor management interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass the configured ACL and reach the configured IP addresses on the standby route processor management interface.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful exploitation could enable an attacker to perform further malicious activities on the device. While the vulnerability only allows modification of the target, not confidentiality or availability, the provided mitigations show that the vulnerability can allow access to management plane features like SSH and telnet. This can potentially lead to a full takeover of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **Standby Route Processor Management Interface:** The attack vector is specifically through the standby route processor's Gigabit Ethernet Management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device's standby route processor management interface.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials to exploit this vulnerability, as it bypasses ACLs which are meant to control access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects both IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs.
*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco IOS XR Software when running on devices with dual route processors and when an ACL is configured on the standby route processor management interface.
*   There are no workarounds that directly address the root cause of this vulnerability, however, mitigations are provided
*   Cisco is not aware of public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
