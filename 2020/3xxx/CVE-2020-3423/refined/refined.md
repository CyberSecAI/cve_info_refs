Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-3423:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on Lua function calls within the user-supplied Lua scripts, specifically in the implementation of the Lua interpreter integrated into Cisco IOS XE Software. This lack of restrictions allows an attacker to bypass the scripting sandbox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** When a malicious Lua script is processed, it can trigger an exploitable buffer overflow condition.
- **Insufficient Restriction on Lua Function Calls:** The Lua interpreter's implementation doesn't properly restrict the function calls allowed within the scripting sandbox.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying Linux OS of the affected device.
- **Root Privileges:** The arbitrary code execution occurs with *root* privileges, granting the attacker full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the affected Cisco device.
- **Malicious Lua Script:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by submitting a specially crafted Lua script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Credentials:** The attacker needs to have valid administrative credentials on the affected Cisco IOS XE device.
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device to submit the malicious Lua script.
