| VMware Cloud Foundation 3.10 | 26 MAY 2020 | Build 16223257  VMware Cloud Foundation 3.10.0.1 | 02 JUL 2020 | Build 16419449  Check for additions and updates to these release notes. |

## What's New

The VMware Cloud Foundation (VFC) 3.10 release includes the following:

* **ESXi Cluster-Level and Parallel Upgrades**: Enables you to update the ESXi software on multiple clusters in the management domain or a workload domain in parallel. Parallel upgrades reduce the overall time required to upgrade your environment.
* **NSX-T Data Center Cluster-Level and Parallel Upgrades**: Enables you to upgrade all Edge clusters in parallel, and then all host clusters in parallel. Parallel upgrades reduce the overall time required to upgrade your environment. You can also select specific clusters to upgrade. The ability to select clusters allows for multiple upgrade windows and does not require all clusters to be available at a given time.
* **Skip Level Upgrades**: Enables you to upgrade to VMware Cloud Foundation 3.10 from version 3.5 and later.
* **Option to turn off Application Virtual Networks (AVNs) during Bring-up**: AVNs deploy vRealize Suite components on NSX overlay networks, and it is recommended you use this option during bring-up. If you turn off AVN during bring-up, vRealize Suite components are deployed to a VLAN-backed distributed port group.
* **Option to deploy vRealize Suite 2019 products**: Instead of the legacy vRealize Suite product versions included in the Cloud Foundation 3.10 Bill of Materials, you can deploy vRealize Suite 2019 products following prescriptive guidance.
* **BOM Updates for the 3.10 Release**: Updated Bill of Materials with new product versions.

## VMware Cloud Foundation Bill of Materials (BOM)

The Cloud Foundation software product is comprised of the following software Bill-of-Materials (BOM). The components in the BOM are interoperable and compatible.

**VMware Response to Apache Log4j Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**: VMware Cloud Foundation is impacted by CVE-2021-44228, and CVE-2021-45046 as described in [VMSA-2021-0028](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0028.html). To remediate these issues, see [Workaround instructions to address CVE-2021-44228 & CVE-2021-45046 in VMware Cloud Foundation (KB 87095)](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87095).

Note:

* vRealize Log Insight Content Packs are deployed during the workload domain creation.
* VMware Solution Exchange and the vRealize Log Insight in-product marketplace store only the latest versions of the content packs for vRealize Log Insight. The Bill of Materials table contains the latest versions of the packs that were available at the time VMware Cloud Foundation is released. When you deploy the Cloud Foundation components, it is possible that the version of a content pack within the in-product marketplace for vRealize Log Insight is newer than the one used for this release.
* To remediate [VMSA-2020-0007](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0007.html) (CVE-2020-3953 and CVE-2020-3954) for vRealize Log Insight 4.8, you must apply the vRealize Log Insight 4.8 security patch. For information on the security patch, see [KB article 79168](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/79168). ​
* For this release, you can install the vRealize Suite 2019 products instead of those listed in the BOM. These include vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager 8.1, vRealize Log Insight 8.1.1, vRealize Operations 8.1, and vRealize Automation 8.1 along with Workspace ONE Access. For prescriptive guidance on deploying and configuring these products with Cloud Foundation 3.10, see [Deployment of VMware vRealize Suite 2019 on VMware Cloud Foundation 3.10](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Validated-Design/services/deployment-of-vrealize-suite-2019-on-vmware-cloud-foundation-310/GUID-B3CC7D32-82C6-4AFA-8FBA-DDD88928D642.html).

### Bring-up Known Issues

* **The Cloud Foundation Builder VM remains locked after more than 15 minutes.**

  The VMware Imaging Appliance (VIA) locks out the user after three unsuccessful login attempts. Normally, the lockout is reset after fifteen minutes but the underlying Cloud Foundation Builder VM does not automatically reset.

  Workaround: Using SSH, log in as admin to the Cloud Foundation Builder VM, then switch to the `root` user. Unlock the account by resetting the password of the admin user with the following command.

  `pam_tally2 --user=<user> --reset`
* **The bring-up process fails at task stop TLS 1.0 on the vRealize Log Insight nodes**

  The bring-up fails at the stop TLS 1.0 on the vRealize Log Insight nodes with the following error `Connect to 10.0.0.17:9543 [/10.0.0.17] failed: Connection refused (Connection refused)`. This issue has been observed in the slow environments after restarting a vRealize Log Insight node. The node does not start correctly and its API is not reachable.

  Workaround: Use the following procedure to work around this issue.

  1. Restart the failed bring-up execution in the Cloud Foundation Builder VM and open the bring-up logs.

     This will retry the failed the bring-up task which might still fail on the initial attempt. The log shows an unsuccessful connection to the vRealize Log Insight node.
  2. While bring-up is still running, use SSH to log in to the vRealize Log Insight node that is shown as failed in the bring-up log.
  3. Run the following command to determine the connection issue.

     `loginsight-node-2:~ # service loginsight status`

     It should confirm that the daemon is not running.
  4. Execute the following command:

     `loginsight-node-2:~ # mv /storage/core/loginsight/cidata/cassandra/data/system ~/cassandra_keyspace_files`
  5. Reboot the vRealize Log Insight node.
  6. Confirm that it is running.

     `loginsight-node-2:~ # uptime`

     `18:25pm up 0:02, 1 user, load average: 3.16, 1.07, 0.39`

     `loginsight-node-2:~ # service loginsight status`

     `Log Insight is running.`

  In a few minutes, the bring-up process should successfully establish a connection to the vRealize Log Insight node and proceed.
* **Cloud Foundation Builder VM deployment fails with the "[Admin/Root] password does not meet standards" message**

  When configuring the Cloud Foundation Builder admin and root passwords, the format restrictions are not validated. As a result, you can create a password that does not meet the requirements and the Cloud Foundation Builder VM deployment will fail.

  Workaround: When configuring the Cloud Foundation Builder, ensure that the password meets the following restrictions:

  + Minimum eight characters long
  + Must include at least one uppercase letter
  + Must include at least one lowercase letter
  + Must include at least one digit
  + Must include at least one special character

### Upgrade Known Issues

* **Lifecycle Management displays fatal error**

  When the user password in the `/opt/vmware/vcf/lcm/lcm-app/conf/application.properties` file contains a backslash (\), Lifecycle Manager does not start and displays the fatal error `Password authentication failed for user lcm`.

  Workaround: Follow the steps below to resolve the error:

  1. SSH to the SDDC Manager VM.
  2. Type `su` to switch to root user.
  3. Open the `/opt/vmware/vcf/lcm/lcm-app/conf/application.properties` file, remove all backslashes (\) from the `lcm.datasource.password` field, and save the file.
  4. Run the command `systemctl restart lcm-db`.
* **NSX Data Center for vSphere upgrade fails with the message "Host Prep remediation failed"**

  After addressing the issue, the NSX Data Center for vSphere bundle no longer appears as an available update.

  Workaround: To complete the upgrade, manually enable the anti-affinity rules.

  1. Log in to the management vCenter Server using the vSphere Client.
  2. Click **Menu > Hosts and Clusters** and select the cluster on which host prep remediation failed (for example SDDC-Cluster1).
  3. Click **Configure > Configuration > VM/Host Rules**.
  4. Select **NSX Controller Anti-Affinity Rule** and click **Edit**.
  5. Select **Enable rule** and click **OK**.

  This completes the NSX Data Center for vSphere upgrade.
* **When there is no associated workload domain to vRealize Automation, the VRA VM NODES CONSISTENCY CHECK upgrade precheck fails**

  This upgrade precheck compares the content in the logical inventory on the SDDC Manager and the content in the vRealize Lifecycle Manager environment. When there is no associated workload domain, the vRealize Lifecycle Manager environment does not contain information about the `iaasagent1.rainpole.local` and `iaasagent2.rainpole.local` nodes. Therefore the check fails.

  Workaround: None. You can safely ignore a failed `VRA VM NODES CONSISTENCY CHECK` during the upgrade precheck. The upgrade will succeed even with this error.
* **Error upgrading vRealize Automation**

  Under certain circumstances, upgrading vRealize Automation may fail with a message similar to:

  ```
  An automated upgrade has failed. Manual intervention is required.
  vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager Pre-upgrade checks for vRealize Automation have failed:
  vRealize Automation Validations : iaasms1.rainpole.local : RebootPending : Check if reboot is pending : Reboot the machine.
  vRealize Automation Validations : iaasms2.rainpole.local : RebootPending : Check if reboot is pending : Reboot the machine.
  Please retry the upgrade once the upgrade is available again.
  ```

  1. Log-in into the first VM listed in the error message using RDP or the VMware Remote Console.
  2. Reboot the VM.
  3. Wait 5 minutes after the login screen of the VM appears.
  4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the next VM listed in the error message.
  5. Once you have restarted all the VMs listed in the error message, retry the vRealize Automation upgrade.
* **The vRealize Automation upgrade reports the "Precheck Execution Failure : Make sure the latest version of VMware Tools is installed" message**

  The vRealize Automation IaaS VMs must have the same version of VMware Tools as the ESXi hosts on which the VMs reside.

  Workaround: Upgrade VMware Tools on the vRealize Automation IaaS VMs.

### vRealize Suite Known Issues

* **vRealize Log Insight installation gets stuck due to incorrect MTU configuration**

  During deployment, Edge Service Gateways send frames with the MTU specified in the **Universal Distributed Logical Router - MTU Size** field in the deployment parameters file to the Top of Rack switches. If this MTU size is not configured correctly in your infrastructure, the vRealize Log Insight deployment may hang on an installation task after the `Apply vRealize Log Insight License` task.

  If any of these tasks remain incomplete for more than 30 minutes. follow the workaround below.

  1. Fix the routing between the Edge-vTEP network and ESXi-vTEP network
  2. SSH to the Cloud Builder VM.
  3. Switch to root:

     + `sudo -i`
  1. Restart the bring-up service:

  **systemctl restart vcf-bringup**

  Wait five minutes to get all services online.

  Retry the bring-up process.
* **The password update for vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager may run infinitely or may fail when the password contains special character "%"**

  Password management uses the vRealize Lifecycle Manager API to update the password of vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager. When there is special character "%" in either of SSH or API or Administrator credential types of the vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager users, then the vRealize Lifecycle Manager API hangs and doesn't respond to password management. There is a timeout of 5 mins and password management marks the operation as failed.

  Workaround:Retry the password update operation without the special character "%". Ensure that the passwords for all other vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager accounts don't contain the "%" special character.
* **vRealize Operations Manager: VMware Security Advisory VMSA-2021-0018**

  [VMSA-2021-0018](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0018.html) describes security vulnerabilities that affect VMware Cloud Foundation.

  Workaround: See [KB 85452](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/85452) for information about applying vRealize Operations Security Patches that resolve the issues.

### Networking Known Issues

* **NSX Manager is not visible in the vSphere Web Client.**

  In addition to NSX Manager not being visible in the vSphere Web Client, the following error message displays in the NSX Home screen: "No NSX Managers available. Verify current user has role assigned on NSX Manager." This issue occurs when vCenter Server is not correctly configured for the account that is logged in.

  Workaround: To resolve this issue, follow the procedure detailed in Knowledge Base article 2080740 ["No NSX Managers available" error in the vSphere Web Client](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2080740).

### SDDC Manager Known Issues

* **SDDC Manager cannot manage the passwords for the NSX Edges and UDLR/DLR deployed to support application virtual networking**

  These passwords are not managed through the SDDC Manager Dashboard.

  Workaround: Refer to the NSX Data Center for vSphere documentation for information about how to update these passwords.
* **APIs for managing SDDC cannot be executed from the SDDC Manager Dashboard**

  You cannot use the API Explorer in the SDDC Manager Dashboard to execute the APIs for managing SDDC (`/v1/sddc`).

  Workaround: None. These APIs can only be executed using the Cloud Builder as the host.
* **Unable to delete VI workload domain enabled for vRealize Operations Manager from SDDC Manager.**

  Attempts to delete the vCenter adapter also fail, and return an SSL error.

  Workaround: Use the following procedure to resolve this issue.

  1. Create a vCenter adapter instance in vRealize Operations Manager, as described in [Configure a vCenter Adapter Instance in vRealize Operations Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Operations-Manager/7.5/com.vmware.vcom.config.doc/GUID-19DAD6AF-7262-4655-B69F-6C665E33B52F.html). This step is required because the existing adapter was deleted by the failed workload domain deletion.
  2. Follow the procedure described in [Knowledge Base article 56946](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/56946).
  3. Restart the failed VI workload domain deletion workflow from the SDDC Manager interface.

### Workload Domain Known Issues

* **Deleting an NSX-T workload domain or cluster containing a dead host fails at transport node deletion step**

  During a delete NSX-T workflow involving a dead host, VMware Cloud Foundation attempts to update the corresponding transport node with uninstall mappings. This task fails because of the dead host, and the delete workflow fails.

  Workaround: Contact VMware Support.
* **Workload domain operations fail if cluster upgrade is in progress**

  Workload domain operations cannot be performed if one or more clusters are being upgraded. The UI does not block such oeprations during an upgrade.

  Workaround: Do not perform any operations on the workload domain when a cluster upgrade is in progress.
* **Cluster is deleted even if VMs are up and running on the cluster**

  When you delete a cluster, it gets deleted even if there are VMs running on the cluster. This includes critical VMs such as Edge VMs, which may prevent you from accessing your environment after the cluster gets deleted.

  Workaround: Migrate the VMs to a different cluster before deleting the cluster.
* **VI workload domain creation or expansion operations fail**

  If there is a mismatch between the letter case (upper or lower) of an ESXi host's FQDN and the FQDN used when the host was commissioned, then workload domain creation and expansion may fail.

  Workaround: ESXi hosts should have lower case FQDNs and should be commissioned using lower case FQDNs.
* **Creating an NSX-T workload domain fails on the task "Add management domain vCenter as compute manager"**

  This can happen if a previous attempt to create an NSX-T workload domain failed and Cloud Foundation was unable to clean up after the failed task.

  Workaround: Manually remove the NSX-T Data Center extension from the management vCenter Server and try to create the NSX-T workload domain again. See [Remove NSX-T Data Center Extension from vCenter Server](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/2.5/administration/GUID-E6E2F017-1106-48C5-ABCA-3D3E9130A863.html).
* **Operations on NSX-T workload domains fails if their host FQDNs include uppercase letters**

  If the FQDNs of ESXi hosts in an NSX-T workload domain include uppercase letters, then the following operations may fail for the workload domain:

  + Add a host
  + Remove a host
  + Add a cluster
  + Remove a cluster
  + Delete the workload domain

  Workaround: See [KB 76553](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/76553).
* **Add cluster operation fails**

  Adding a cluster to a workload domain with 50 or more VMware ESXi nodes may fail.

  Workaround: Contact VMware Support for help.
* **The certificate rotate operation on the second NSX-T domain fails**

  Certificate rotation works on the first NSX-T workload domain in your environment, but fails on all subsequent NSX-T workload domains.

  Workaround: None
* **vSAN partition and critical alerts are generated when the witness MTU is not set to 9000**

  If the MTU of the witness switch in the witness appliance is not set to 9000, the vSAN stretch cluster partition may occur.

  Workaround: Set the MTU of the witness switch in the witness appliance to 9000 MTU.
* **If the witness ESXi version does not match with the host ESXi version in the cluster, vSAN cluster partition may occur**

  vSAN stretch cluster workflow does not check the ESXi version of the witness host. If the witness ESXi version does not match the host version in the cluster, then vSAN cluster partition may happen.

  Workaround:

  1. Upgrade the witness host manually with the matching ESXi version using the vCenter VUM functionality.
  2. Replace or deploy the witness appliance matching with the ESXi version.
* **Deploying partner services on an NSX-T workload domain displays an error**

  Deploying partner services on an NSX-T workload domain such as McAfee or Trend displays the “Configure NSX at cluster level to deploy Service VM” error.

  Workaround: Attach the Transport node profile to the cluster and try deploying the partner service. After the service is deployed, detach the transport node profile from the cluster.
* **A vCenter Server on which certificates have been rotated is not accessible from a Horizon workload domain**

  VMware Cloud Foundation does not support the certificate rotation on the Horizon workload domains.

  Workaround: See KB article [70956](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/70956).
* **NSX Manager for VI workload domain is not displayed in vCenter**

  Although NFS-based VI workload domains are created successfully, the NSX Manager VM is not registered in vCenter Server and is not displayed in vCenter.

  Workaround: To resolve this issue, use the following procedure:

  1. Log in to NSX Manager (http://<nsxmanager IP>).
  2. Navigate to **Manage > NSX Management Service**.
  3. Un-register the lookup service and vCenter, then re-register.
  4. Close the browser and log in to vCenter.
* **Adding host fails when host is on a different VLAN**

  A host add operation can sometimes fail if the host is on a different VLAN.

  Workaround:

  1. Before adding the host, add a new portgroup to the VDS for that cluster.
  2. Tag the new portgroup with the VLAN ID of the host to be added.
  3. Add the Host. This workflow fails at the "Migrate host vmknics to dvs" operation.
  4. Locate the failed host in vCenter, and migrate the vmk0 of the host to the new portgroup you created in step 1. For more information, see [Migrate VMkernel Adapters to a vSphere Distributed Switch](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.networking.doc/GUID-0DE237B8-1938-4DE9-90EC-718E345B56A0.html) in the vSphere product documentation.
  5. Retry the Add Host operation.

  **NOTE**: If you later remove this host in the future, you must manually remove the portgroup as well if it is not being used by any other host.

### Security Operations Known Issues

* **Addition of members from PKS UAA to Harbor library fails when the certificate verification is enabled**

  This issue occurs when Harbor does not honor the certificate chain under **System Settings** > **Registry Root Certificate**.

  Workaround:

  1. SSH into the SDDC Manager VM as the `vcf` user.
  2. Run the following command. Make sure to update the password of the **admin** user and the Harbor URL: `curl -k -H'Content-type: application/json' -u admin:"< >" -XPUT https://harbor.vrack.vsphere.local/api/configurations -d '{"uaa_verify_cert":"false"}'`

  Harbor is in the UAA authentication mode and it uses members from PKS UAA.

  To create a user in UAA:

  1. Connect through SSH to Ops Manager appliance
  2. Run the following:

  `uaac target https://pks.vrack.vsphere.local:8443 --skip-ssl-validation`

  `uaac token client get admin`

  `uaac user add <<user-name> > --emails <<email> >`

### Multi-Instance Management Known Issues

* **Multi-Instance Management Dashboard operation fails**

  After a controller joins or leaves a federation, Kafka is restarted on all controllers in the federation. It can take up to 15 minutes for the federation to stabilize. Any operations performed on the dashboard during this time may fail.

  Workaround: Re-try the operation.
* **The federation creation progress is not displayed**

  While federation creation is in progress, the SDDC manager UI displays the progress on the multi-site page. If you navigate into any other screen and come back to the multi-site screen, the progress messages are not displayed. An empty map with no VMware Cloud Foundation instances is displayed until the federation creation process completes.

  Workaround: None
* **Federation creation information not displayed if you leave the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard**

  Federation creation progress is displayed on the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard. If you navigate to another screen and then return to the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard, progress messages are not displayed. Instead, an empty map with no Cloud Foundation instances are displayed until the federation is created.

  Workaround: Stay on the Multi-Instance Dashboard till the task is complete. If you have navigated away, wait for around 20 minutes and then return to the dashboard by which time the operation should have completed.

### API Known Issues

* **Unversionsed APIs are not Supported**

  Unversioned APIs in Cloud Foundation have been deprecated.

  Use Cloud Foundation public APIs.
