Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2020-3962:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the SVGA (Super VGA) device within VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion. This occurs when the software attempts to access memory that has already been freed, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security breaches.
- The specific flaw lies within handling the `SVGA DXInvalidateContext` command. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object before performing operations on it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability.
- Lack of proper validation of object existence before operation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the hypervisor. This means an attacker with local access to a virtual machine could potentially gain control over the underlying host system.
- Code execution on the hypervisor: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on the hypervisor. This level of access is highly sensitive and can lead to further malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to a virtual machine is required.
- The virtual machine must have 3D graphics enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to a virtual machine running on a vulnerable VMware product.
- The attacker must be able to execute high-privileged code on the guest system.
- The attacker must be able to send malicious `SVGA DXInvalidateContext` commands.

**Additional notes:**
- 3D graphics are not enabled by default on ESXi, but are enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" with a CVSSv3 base score of 9.3
- The vulnerability was reported by Corentin Bayet (@OnlyTheDuck) and Bruno Pujos (@BrunoPujos) from Synacktiv (@Synacktiv) working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
