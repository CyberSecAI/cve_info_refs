Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3187:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation of the HTTP URL in the web services interface of Cisco ASA and FTD software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw. By sending a crafted HTTP request with directory traversal character sequences (e.g., `../`), an attacker can navigate the file system beyond the intended web services directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized File Access:** An attacker can use the vulnerability to read arbitrary files within the web services file system.
- **File Deletion:** Attackers can also delete arbitrary files within the web services file system.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information**: The attacker can view files that may contain WebVPN configurations, bookmarks, web cookies, partial web content, and HTTP URLs.
- **Note:** The attacker can only access and modify files within the web services file system. They cannot access ASA or FTD system files or the underlying OS files. Deleted files are restored upon device reload.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attack can be carried out remotely by an unauthenticated attacker, over a network connection.
- **Crafted HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP requests that include directory traversal sequences within the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a network connection to the targeted system and the ability to send HTTP requests.
- The attacker does not require any authentication to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker must be able to reach a system with the vulnerable AnyConnect or WebVPN feature enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features.
- There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability does not affect Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.
- The vulnerability was reported by Mikhail Klyuchnikov of Positive Technologies.
