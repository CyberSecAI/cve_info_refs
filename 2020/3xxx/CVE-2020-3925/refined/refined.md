Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3925:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure use of the `LoadLibraryA` function within the ServiSign DLL file. Specifically, the function lacks proper filtering or restrictions on the path parameter used to load DLL files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted DLL Loading:** The `LoadLibraryA` function is called without validating or sanitizing the provided path, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary path to a DLL file.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The function doesn't implement proper access controls, meaning an attacker can potentially load a DLL from any location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By providing a path to a malicious DLL, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's system, as the malicious DLL will be loaded and executed.
- The provided information also mentions that an attacker can achieve this via cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads embedded in phishing websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Phishing Websites:** The primary attack vector is through phishing websites containing malicious Javascript code that injects parameters to trigger the vulnerable function.
- **XSS Payloads:** The attack relies on the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages that users visit while having the vulnerable ServiSign software installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Inject Javascript:** An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious Javascript code into web pages. This may involve compromising legitimate websites or creating phishing websites that users are tricked into visiting.
- **Target System with Vulnerable ServiSign:** The target system must have the vulnerable version of the ServiSign software installed.

**Additional Information:**

- The document specifies that the affected software is "ServiSign for Windows ver. <= 1.0.19.0617".
- The document also indicates that this vulnerability was discovered by CHT Security.
- This vulnerability is directly linked to Remote Code Execution (RCE) by loading arbitrary DLL's.
