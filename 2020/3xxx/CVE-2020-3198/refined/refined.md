Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2020-3198:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain values in packets destined for UDP port 9700.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to improper handling of inter-VM signaling packets on UDP port 9700. Specifically, the software fails to perform adequate bounds checking on values within these packets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- The attacker can cause an affected system to crash and reload.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malicious UDP packets over IPv4 or IPv6 to an affected device.
- The malicious packets must be destined to and processed by the affected device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected device. No authentication is required.

**Additional details:**
- The affected devices are Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) and Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers (CGR1000) running vulnerable versions of Cisco IOS Software.
- The inter-VM signaling occurs via a UDP channel on port 9700. Signaling packets are not restricted and are processed even when not from internal, local VMs.
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. A mitigation is provided by implementing an ACL or iACL to restrict inbound traffic destined for UDP port 9700.
- This vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 9.8 and a "Critical" Security Impact Rating (SIR).
