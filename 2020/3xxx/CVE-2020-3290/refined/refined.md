Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-3290:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient boundary restrictions on user-supplied input to scripts within the web-based management interface of affected Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Overflow:** Sending crafted requests with overly large values to the web-based management interface can cause a stack overflow. This occurs because the application does not properly validate or restrict the size of the input, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Device Crash:** A successful exploit can cause the affected device to crash.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system of the router.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the web-based management interface.
*   **Network:** The attack vector is network based, an attacker must be able to send crafted http requests to the vulnerable device's web management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs to have valid administrative credentials to log into the web-based management interface of the affected router.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the management interface, which could be via the local LAN or through remote management if enabled.

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco Small Business RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers
*   Cisco Small Business RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers
*   Cisco Small Business RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Routers
*   Cisco Small Business RV042 Dual WAN VPN Routers
*   Cisco Small Business RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers
*   Cisco Small Business RV082 Dual WAN VPN Routers

**Vulnerable Firmware Versions:**

*   RV016, RV042, RV042G, and RV082: Firmware versions 4.2.3.10 and earlier
*   RV320 and RV325: Firmware versions 1.5.1.05 and earlier

**Additional Information**
*   The advisory indicates that proof-of-concept exploit code exists for these vulnerabilities.
*   Cisco released software updates to address the vulnerabilities.
