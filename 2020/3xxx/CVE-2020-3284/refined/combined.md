| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.1 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.1 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.1 |

The PXE boot loader is part of the BIOS and runs over the management interface of hardware platforms that are running Cisco IOS XR Software only.  The vulnerability exists because internal commands that are issued when the PXE network boot process is loading a software image are not properly verified. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by compromising the PXE boot server and replacing a valid software image with a malicious one. Alternatively, the attacker could impersonate the PXE boot server and send a PXE boot reply with a malicious file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute unsigned code on the affected device.  **Note:** To fix this vulnerability, both the Cisco IOS XR Software and the BIOS must be upgraded. The BIOS code is included in Cisco IOS XR Software but might require additional installation steps. For further information, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxr-pxe-unsign-code-exec-qAa78fD2>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software and the following conditions are met:    + The product ID (PID) of the device matches one of the PIDs listed in the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.   + The device is running a vulnerable BIOS version.   + The device uses PXE for network boot. For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine the Product ID To check the PID of a device, use the **show inventory raw** CLI command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that has the PID NC55-RP:  ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:router# show inventory raw.   .   .   ```   ```   NAME: "0/RP0", DESCR: "NCS 5500 Route Processor"PID: NC55-RP           , VID: V01, SN: SAL1926HRW5   ```   ```   NAME: "0/1/* - cpu", DESCR: "cpu"PID: , VID: V00, SN: SAD093000JRNAME: "0/1/* - cpu - 1.6V_P0", DESCR: "Voltage Sensor"PID: , VID: N/A, SN:.   .   .   ```  If the PID is listed in one of the tables in the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory, then the device may be vulnerable if it is running a vulnerable BIOS version and is using PXE for network boot. Determine the BIOS Version To determine which BIOS version is running on a device, use the **show fpd package** CLI command. The following example shows the output for a device that has the PID *A9K-RSP880-LT-TR* and is running BIOS version 17.16:       | RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router# **show fpd package**Wed Nov 4 21:55:45.713 UTC | | | | | | |   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |   | ======================= | ================================================ Field Programmable Device Package================================================ | | | | | |   |  |  | | | | | |   | Card Type | FPD Description | Type | Subtype | SWVersion | Min ReqSW Vers | Min ReqHW Vers |   | ======================= | ========================== | ==== | ======= | =========== | ======== | ========= |   | ASR-9910-BPID2 | Can Bus Ctrl (CBC) BP2Can Bus Ctrl (CBC) BP2 | bplc | cbccbc | 7.1057.105 | 0.000.00 | 0.10.1 |   | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | | | | |   | ... | | | | | | |   | **A9K-RSP880-LT-TR** | Can Bus Ctrl (CBC) RSP4MB CPUCtrl DBCtrlDBCtrlDBCtrlFsbl LinuxFW**ROMMONB** RSP4L | lclclclclclclclc | cbcfpga2fpga3fpga4fpga5fsbllnxfwrommon | 50.01 0.13 0.05 0.04 0.04 1.103 1.103**17.16** | 0.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.00 | 0.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.0 |   | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | | | | |   | ... | | | | | | |       To determine which BIOS version is running on a Network Convergence System 5500 Series Router, use the **show hw-module fpd Bootloader** CLI command.

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + 8000 Series Routers   + Carrier Routing System (CRS-X)   + IOS Software   + IOS XE Software   + IOS XR 32-bit Software   + IOS XR White box (IOSXRWBD)   + IOS XRv 9000 Router   + Network Convergence System (NCS) 6000 Series Routers   + NX-OS Software   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS B-Series Blade Servers   + UCS C-Series M3 Rack Servers - Standalone   + UCS C-Series M4 Rack Servers - Standalone   + UCS C-Series M5 Rack Servers - Managed   + UCS C-Series M5 Rack Servers - Standalone  Details  * PXE is included in the network card of the management interface of routers that are running Cisco IOS XR Software and is part of the device BIOS. PXE is used to re-image the system and boot the router in case of boot failure or in the absence of a valid, bootable partition. PXE acts as a bootloader and provides the flexibility to choose the image that the system will boot based on the PID, the serial number, or the management interface MAC address. PXE downloads an ISO image, which is specified as part of the PXE reply from a PXE boot server, installs the ISO contents onto the device, and then transfers control to the installed software image.  PXE must be defined in the DHCP server configuration file. For additional information, see [Boot using iPXE](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/ncs5500/system-setup/60x/b-ncs5500-system-setup-guide-60x/b-system-setup-ncs5k_chapter_0111.html#concept_F52D0A35637E4583972405EA4164C229) and [Boot the Router Using iPXE](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr9000/software/asr9k-r6-5/system-setup/configuration/guide/b-system-setup-cg-asr9000-65x/b-system-setup-cg-asr9000_chapter_010.html#id_89365).  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases In the following tables, the left column lists the PIDs of Cisco products that may be affected by this vulnerability. The center column lists the first release of Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column lists the first version of the BIOS that includes the fix for this vulnerability.  PIDs that are not shown in these tables are not known to be affected by this vulnerability. BIOS versions earlier than the first fixed version are affected by this vulnerability.  A fixed BIOS image must be installed on the device in order to fix this vulnerability. The BIOS image is not provided in a standalone package but is embedded in Cisco IOS XR Software. In some cases, the BIOS may not automatically update when Cisco IOS XR Software is upgraded. To check the BIOS version, use the **show fpd package** or **show hw-module fpd Bootloader** command, as shown in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section. If the BIOS has not been upgraded to a fixed version, as listed below, see [Upgrading Field-Programmable Device](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/ncs5500/sysman/66x/b-system-management-cg-ncs5500-66x/b-system-management-cg-ncs5500-66x_chapter_01101.html) and use the **upgrade hw-module location** command to upgrade the BIOS.  **ASR 9000 Series Route Switch Processor**       | Cisco ASR 9000 Series PIDs1 | First Fixed Release of Cisco IOS XR Software for This Vulnerability | First Fixed BIOS Version for This Vulnerability |   | --- | --- | --- |   | A9K-RSP880-SEA9K-RSP880-TR | 6.5.2 | 10.65 |   | A99-RP2-SEA99-RP2-TR | 6.5.2 | 14.35 |   | A99-RSP-SEA99-RSP-TR | 6.5.2 | 16.14 |   | A9K-RSP880-LT-SEA9K-RSP880-LT-TR | 6.5.2 | 17.34 |   | ASR-9901-RP | 6.5.2 | 22.20 |   | A99-RP3-SEA99-RP3-TR | 6.5.2 | 30.23 |   | A9K-RSP5-SEA9K-RSP5-TR | 6.5.2 | 31.20 |      1.
