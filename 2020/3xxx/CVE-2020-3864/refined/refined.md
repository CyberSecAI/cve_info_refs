The provided documents contain information about CVE-2020-3864.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic issue in WebKit Page Loading.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A DOM object context may not have had a unique security origin. This is due to a logic flaw in the way security origins are handled in the WebKit Page Loading component.

**Impact of exploitation:** A malicious website could potentially gain access to resources or data that should be protected by the same-origin policy by misrepresenting its security origin. This is a universal cross-site scripting vulnerability that can lead to unauthorized access or modification of data.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by processing maliciously crafted web content. Specifically, the attacker would need to create or control a web page that triggers this incorrect security origin handling.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website that can be visited by a vulnerable user. The user must load this malicious web page in a WebKit-based application.
