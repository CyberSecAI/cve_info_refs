- While the NX-API service is affected, the Cisco NX-OS device itself remains available and continues to pass network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP or HTTPS request to the external NX-API to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device's NX-API interface.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The NX-API feature is disabled by default in Cisco NX-OS.
- The vulnerability affects MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches and Nexus 7000 Series Switches running specific versions of Cisco NX-OS software.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds.
