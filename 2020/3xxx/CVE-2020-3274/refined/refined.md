The provided content relates to CVE-2020-3274.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers does not properly validate user-supplied input to scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper input validation in the web-based management interface. This allows for command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with *root* privileges on the underlying operating system.

**Attack vectors:**
An authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges can send malicious requests to the affected device through the web-based management interface. The web-based management interface is accessible via the local LAN connection, or through the remote management feature if enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrative privileges to log in to the web-based management interface. The attacker can be remote if remote management is enabled on the affected device, or on the local network otherwise.
