Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-3280:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of user-supplied content within the Java Remote Management Interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The software improperly handles serialized Java objects, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code through a crafted object.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated, remote attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.
- **Root Privileges:** The attacker can execute code as the *root* user, gaining complete control over the system.
- **Full compromise:** The vulnerability allows for full compromise of the affected system with full control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attacker sends a malicious serialized Java object to a specific listener on the affected system over the network.
- **Remote:** The attacker can be located anywhere on the network, and does not require local access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated access:** The attacker does not need any prior credentials.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the affected system on the network to send the malicious payload.
- **Ability to craft malicious serialized Java object:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious payload that the application will deserialize.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Unified CCX software.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
- The CVSS score is 9.8 (Critical), highlighting the severity of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation).
- There are Snort rules available for detection.
