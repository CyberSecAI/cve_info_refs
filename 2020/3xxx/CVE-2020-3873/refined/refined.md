- **Root cause:** The issue lies in the handling of mail previews when the "Load remote content in messages‚Äù setting is turned off. The setting does not apply to all mail previews.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Inconsistent setting propagation for remote content loading in mail previews.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Disregarding user setting to disable remote content loading. Mail previews may load remote content even when the user has disabled this setting in mail preferences. This could lead to privacy issues or expose the user to malicious content.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send an email that will load remote content in the preview pane, regardless of the user setting.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send an email to the targeted user.
