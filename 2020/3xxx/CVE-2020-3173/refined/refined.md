- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation of command arguments in the local management (local-mgmt) CLI of Cisco UCS Manager Software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability (CWE-78).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system (OS) with the privileges of the currently logged-in user. On Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects, the injected commands are executed with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through the local management CLI by including crafted arguments to specific commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An authenticated, local attacker is required to exploit the vulnerability.
