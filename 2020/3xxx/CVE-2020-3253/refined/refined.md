**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the affected device.
*   **Support tunnel manipulation:** The attacker must enable the support tunnel, set a key, and derive the tunnel password to gain access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the local system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Local presence:** The attacker must have local access to the device to enable the support tunnel.
