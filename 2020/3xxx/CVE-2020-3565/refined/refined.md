Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3565:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from how TCP Intercept is invoked in Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software. Specifically, when the embryonic connection limit is reached, TCP Intercept is triggered, which can cause the underlying detection engine to process packets incorrectly. This leads to a bypass of Access Control Policies and Service Policies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect handling of packets by the detection engine when TCP Intercept is activated due to exceeding embryonic connection limits.
- Improper invocation of TCP Intercept leading to policy bypass.
- Vulnerable to crafted stream of traffic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Bypassing of configured Access Control Policies, including Geolocation, and Service Policies.
- Potential to forward traffic that should be dropped.
- Potential to drop traffic that should be forwarded.
- Allows attackers to match on an incorrect policy.
- Allows traffic to bypass intended security measures.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker sends a crafted stream of traffic to an affected system.
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending traffic that triggers the TCP Intercept mechanism when embryonic connection limits are reached.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated, remote attacker.
- Ability to send network traffic to the vulnerable system.
- Knowledge to craft a traffic stream to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present when TCP Intercept is configured.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading to the fixed software releases.
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.

This content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description. It specifies the conditions under which the vulnerability can be exploited and provides information about the affected product, how to determine if TCP intercept is configured, fixed software, and a lack of available workarounds.
