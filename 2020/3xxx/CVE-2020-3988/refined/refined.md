- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the JPEG2000 parser within the Cortado ThinPrint component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor with normal access to a virtual machine may be able to exploit this issue to create a partial denial-of-service condition or to leak memory from TPView process running on the system where Workstation or Horizon Client for Windows is installed.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor with normal access to a virtual machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires normal access to a virtual machine. Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing has been enabled. This feature is not enabled by default on Workstation, but it is enabled by default on Horizon Client.
