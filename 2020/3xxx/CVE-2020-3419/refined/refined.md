**Root Cause:** Improper handling of authentication tokens by vulnerable Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco Webex Meetings Server sites.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the way the Webex system processes authentication tokens. It allows for a bypass of the participant list visibility feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can join a Webex session without appearing on the participant list.

*   Attackers send crafted requests to a vulnerable Webex site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be unauthenticated (`PR:N`).
*   The attacker needs to have access to the meeting, including the join link and password.
*   User interaction is required (`UI:R`).

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affected Cisco Webex Meetings sites before November 17, 2020, and specific versions of Cisco Webex Meetings Server.
*   There are no workarounds available.
*   Cisco has released fixes for this vulnerability in their cloud-based Webex Meetings platform and patches for the on-premises Webex Meetings Server software.
*   The CVSS score is 6.5, indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is also referred to as the "Ghost Join Vulnerability".
