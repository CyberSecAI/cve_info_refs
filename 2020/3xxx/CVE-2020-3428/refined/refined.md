Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3428

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect parsing of HTTP packets by the WLAN Local Profiling feature during HTTP-based endpoint device classifications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of HTTP packets leads to a denial-of-service condition. Specifically, a crafted HTTP packet can trigger a device reboot.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit causes the affected device to reboot, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP packet to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be adjacent to the targeted device on the network.
- No authentication is required for the exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The WLAN Local Profiling feature, which contains the vulnerability, is disabled by default.
- Only HTTP-based profiling is vulnerable, other profiling methods are not impacted by this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Cisco Catalyst 9000 Family, including:
  - Catalyst 9800 Embedded Wireless Controller for Catalyst 9300, 9400, and 9500 Series Switches
  - Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers

The following are the affected software versions:
- 16.10.1
- 16.10.1s
- 16.10.1e
- 16.11.1
- 16.11.1a
- 16.11.1b
- 16.11.2
- 16.11.1c
- 16.12.1
- 16.12.1s
- 16.12.1t

The document provides instructions for checking if the WLAN Local Profiling feature is enabled. The following elements must be configured:
```
device classifier
wireless profile policy (name)
http-tlv-caching
```
There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
