##### **1. Impacted Products**

* VMware ESXi
* VMware Workstation Pro / Player (Workstation)
* VMware Fusion Pro / Fusion (Fusion)
* VMware Remote Console for Mac (VMRC for Mac)
* VMware Horizon Client for Mac

##### **2. Introduction**

Multiple security vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi, Workstation, Fusion, VMRC for Mac and Horizon Client for Mac were privately reported to VMware. Patches and workarounds are available to remediate or workaround these vulnerabilities in affected VMware products

##### **3a. Service opener - Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) issue (CVE-2020-3957)**

**Description**

VMware Fusion, VMRC for Mac and Horizon Client for Mac contain a local privilege escalation vulnerability due to a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) issue in the service opener. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Important severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [7.3](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L).

**Known Attack Vectors**

Successful exploitation of this issue may allow attackers with normal user privileges to escalate their privileges to root on the system where Fusion, VMRC for Mac or Horizon Client for Mac is installed.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2020-3957 apply the patches listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' found below.

**Workarounds**

None.

**Additional Documentation**

None.

**Acknowledgements**

VMware would like to thank Rich Mirch of TeamARES from Critical Start Inc. and Jeffball of GRIMM for independently reporting this issue to us.

##### **3b. Denial-of-service vulnerability in Shader functionality (CVE-2020-3958)**

**Description**

VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion contain a denial-of-service vulnerability in the shader functionality. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Moderate severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [4.0](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Known Attack Vectors**

Exploitation of this issue require an attacker to have access to a virtual machine with 3D graphics enabled. It is not enabled by default on ESXi and is enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion.

Successful exploitation of this issue may allow attackers with non-administrative access to a virtual machine to crash the virtual machine's vmx process leading to a denial of service condition.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2020-3958 apply the patches listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' found below.
