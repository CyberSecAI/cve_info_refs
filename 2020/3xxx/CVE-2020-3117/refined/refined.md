Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user input within the API Framework of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) and Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   HTTP Header Injection: The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject crafted HTTP headers into the web server's response.
*   Insufficient Input Validation: The core issue is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied input before it's used to construct HTTP responses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into legitimate HTTP responses.
*   This could potentially lead to various attacks, including:
    *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) if the injected headers can manipulate the response content.
    *   Session hijacking through cookie manipulation.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote Attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   User Interaction:  The attacker must persuade a user to access a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs and must rely on social engineering or other methods to get users to access the malicious URL

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco WSA releases 12.0.1-268 and 11.8.0-382, and in Cisco SMA releases earlier than 13.0.0-187.
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this issue; upgrading to a fixed release is the recommended solution.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
*   Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS score is 4.7 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
