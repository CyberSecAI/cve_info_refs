| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 5.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 5.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 5.8 |

The vulnerability is due to improper handling of packets by the IPsec packet processor. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious ICMP error messages to an affected device that get punted to the IPsec packet processor. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deplete IPsec memory, resulting in all future IPsec packets to an affected device being dropped by the device. Manual intervention is required to recover from this situation.  Cisco has released software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxr-ipsec-dos-q8UPX6m>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco IOS XR Software release prior to 6.4.3, 6.6.3, 7.0.2 and 7.1.1, respectively, that have the IPsec process **ipsec\_mp** or **ipsec\_pp** running. Both IPsec processes are running in Cisco IOS XR Software by default.  See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Determine the Status of the IPsec Processes Administrators can determine whether IPsec processes are running on a device by using the **show processes | include ipsec** command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of this command on a device on which both IPsec processes are running:  ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#show processes | include ipsecThu Feb 27 13:42:05.618 UTC222    5460    0K  20   Sleeping     ipsec_mp         0 222    6055    0K  20   Sleeping     ipsec_mp         0 222    6247    0K  20   Sleeping     ipsec_mp         0 222    6258    0K  20   Sleeping     ipsec_mp         0 222    6502    0K  20   Sleeping     ipsec_mp         0 312    5461    0K  20   Sleeping     ipsec_pp         0 312    6044    0K  20   Sleeping     ipsec_pp         0 312    6220    0K  20   Sleeping     ipsec_pp         0 312    6375    0K  20   Sleeping     ipsec_pp         0 312    6824    0K  20   Sleeping     ipsec_pp         0    ```  If the command does not return any output, the IPsec processes are not running and the device is not vulnerable. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software.  Indicators of Compromise  * When this vulnerability has been exploited successfully, syslog logging will show messages like the following with a depletion level of 100 percent or close to 100 percent:  ```   %PKT_INFRA-PAKWATCH-2-DEPLETION_CATASTROPHIC : Depletion level 100 percent for resource PAK FSV %PKT_INFRA-PAKWATCH-6-USER_INFO : Top 5 users of PAK FSV: %PKT_INFRA-PAKWATCH-6-INFO_HEAD : PROCESS NAME                     PID        COUNT      %PKT_INFRA-PAKWATCH-6-INFO_BODY : pkg/bin/ipsec_pp                 540912     9984       %PKT_INFRA-PAKWATCH-6-INFO_BODY : pkg/bin/udp                      540892     16         %PKT_INFRA-PAKWATCH-6-USER_INFO2 : Only 2 users found using PAK FSV.   ```  Manual intervention is required to recover from this failure condition by restarting the IPsec processes as shown in the following example:  ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#process restart ipsec_mpFri Feb 21 14:48:58.121 UTCRP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#process restart ipsec_ppFri Feb 21 14:49:00.973 UTC   ```  Workarounds  * To prevent exploitability of this vulnerability, administrators can apply access-control lists (ACLs) that deny ICMP unreachable packets to an affected device.  Customers that do not use any IPsec features can also disable the IPsec processes as shown in the following example:  ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#process shutdown ipsec_mpFri Feb 21 14:56:03.870 UTCProcess Shutdown of a process could leave the System in an Inconsistent State.

[confirm]RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#   ```  **Note:** Shutting down the IPsec processes is not persistent across reloads and would need to be re-applied after every system reload.
