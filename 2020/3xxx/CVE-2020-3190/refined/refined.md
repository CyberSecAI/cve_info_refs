Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3190:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of packets by the IPsec packet processor in Cisco IOS XR Software. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by the receipt of malicious ICMP error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Improper handling of ICMP error messages by the IPsec packet processor.
- The IPsec packet processor fails to properly handle malformed or unexpected ICMP error messages.
-  Memory exhaustion vulnerability in the IPsec packet processor

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The attacker can cause the IPsec memory to be depleted, which results in all future IPsec packets being dropped by the affected device.
- Manual intervention (restarting the IPsec processes) is required to recover from this state.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is remote and network based.
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker sends malicious ICMP error messages to the target device. These messages are punted to the IPsec packet processor, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker does not need any authentication credentials.
-  The attacker needs to be able to send malicious ICMP error messages to the affected device.

**Additional Details:**

- Affected software includes Cisco IOS XR Software releases prior to 6.4.3, 6.6.3, 7.0.2, and 7.1.1 that have either the `ipsec_mp` or `ipsec_pp` processes running.
- The vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software.
- Syslog messages will show a high depletion level for the PAK FSV resource during a successful exploit.
-  Workarounds include using ACLs to deny ICMP unreachable packets to the affected device or disabling IPsec processes if they aren't needed. However, disabling the IPsec processes is not persistent across reloads.
- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
