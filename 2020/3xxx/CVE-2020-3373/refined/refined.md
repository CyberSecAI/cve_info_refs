Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3373

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper error handling during IP fragment reassembly in Cisco ASA and FTD software. Specifically, when certain failures occur during the reassembly process, the software fails to handle these errors correctly, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper error handling during IP fragment reassembly
- Memory leak vulnerability due to the above issue

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause a continuous consumption of memory on the affected device.
- This memory leak can eventually prevent traffic from being processed, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The affected device might require a manual reboot to recover from the DoS condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability
- Sending crafted, fragmented IP traffic to a targeted device

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the targeted device.
- No authentication is required.

**Affected Products:**

The following Cisco products are affected by this vulnerability:

- Cisco FTD Software Release 6.6.0.1
- Cisco ASA Software releases:
    - 9.8.4.22
    - 9.8.4.25
    - 9.12.4.2
    - 9.12.4.3
    - 9.13.1.12
    - 9.14.1.15

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
- There are no workarounds available.
- A device may be compromised if the 'show blocks' command indicates a leak of larger-size memory blocks (2,048 or above).
- The provided output of the command shows a leak of memory blocks with size 9344.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- This advisory is part of the October 2020 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.
