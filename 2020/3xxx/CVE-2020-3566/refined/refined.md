Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-3566:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) packets within the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of IGMP packets.
- Memory exhaustion due to excessive resource consumption by the IGMP process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Immediate crash of the IGMP process.
- Memory exhaustion leading to instability in other processes running on the device, including interior and exterior routing protocols.
- Potential instability and impact on other device functions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending crafted IGMP traffic to an affected device.
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted IGMP traffic to the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects any Cisco device running Cisco IOS XR Software with multicast routing enabled and receiving DVMRP traffic.
- The vulnerability can cause either an immediate crash of the IGMP process or a gradual memory exhaustion.
- A rate limiter can help mitigate the memory exhaustion case, but an access control list (ACL) is necessary to prevent both memory exhaustion and the immediate crash.
- The provided CVSS score is 8.6 with the vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
- Cisco has released software updates to address these vulnerabilities.
