Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-3939:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to the presence of reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in several parameters of the stock selection system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Reflected XSS vulnerabilities exist in the application. This means the application does not properly sanitize user inputs before displaying them back to the user in a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   If an attacker successfully exploits this vulnerability, they can control scripts that are executed in the victim's browser.
*   This could allow the attacker to leak sensitive information from the victim's browser. This can include session cookies, personal data, or even redirect the user to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through user interaction. An attacker could craft a malicious URL containing the exploit payload. When a victim clicks on this manipulated link or is otherwise redirected to this malicious URL, the malicious script will be executed in their browser, potentially leading to a data breach or compromise.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to create malicious URLs and entice a user to click them. This may involve social engineering, sending phishing emails, or injecting the malicious link into a website the victim is likely to visit.
*   The attacker does not require direct access to the server. They manipulate input parameters via crafted links.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerabilities were found by CHT Security Red Team during their testing.
*   The report states that multiple parameters of the application are affected by the XSS vulnerability.
*   The known affected software versions are those before 20191223.
