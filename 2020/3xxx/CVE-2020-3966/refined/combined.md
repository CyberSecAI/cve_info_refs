You can remove a USB controller from the virtual machine if you do not want to connect to USB devices.

## Prerequisites

Note: The
ESXi host supports hot-removal of a USB controller. You can remove a USB controller from a virtual machine when both the
ESXi host and the guest operating system of the virtual machine support the hot-removal functionality.

To make sure that the guest operating system of the virtual machine supports the hot-removal functionality, refer to the vendors documentation.

* Verify that the USB controller is not in use.
* Verify that all USB devices are disconnected from the virtual machine.
* Required Privilege: Virtual Machine.Configuration.Add or Remove Device

## Procedure

1. Navigate to a data center, folder, cluster, resource pool, host, or vApp, click the VMs tab and click Virtual Machines.
2. Right-click a virtual machine and click Edit Settings.
3. On the Virtual Hardware tab, move the pointer over the USB controller and click the Remove icon.
4. Click OK to confirm the deletion and close the dialog box.

## Results

The controller is no longer connected to the virtual machine, but remains available to add at a later time.

**Parent topic:**
[USB Configuration from a Client Computer to a Virtual Machine](GUID-800DA713-FB5F-49AF-9045-F21915AB79C8.html "You can add multiple USB devices to a virtual machine when the physical devices connect to a client computer on which the vSphere Client is running. The vSphere Client must be logged in to an instance of vCenter Server that manages the ESXi host where the virtual machines reside. USB passthrough technology supports adding multiple USB devices, such as security dongles, mass storage devices, and smartcard readers to virtual machines.")

You can remove a USB controller from the virtual machine if you do not want to connect to USB devices.

## Prerequisites

Note: The
ESXi host supports hot-removal of a USB controller. You can remove a USB controller from a virtual machine when both the
ESXi host and the guest operating system of the virtual machine support the hot-removal functionality.

To make sure that the guest operating system of the virtual machine supports the hot-removal functionality, refer to the vendors documentation.

* Verify that the USB controller is not in use.
* Verify that all USB devices are disconnected from the virtual machine.
* Required privilege: Virtual Machine.Configuration.Add or Remove Device

## Procedure

1. Navigate to and select a data center, folder, cluster, resource pool, host, or vApp, click the VMs tab and click Virtual Machines. Alternatively, you can navigate to and select directly the virtual machine.

VMware vSphere is VMware's virtualization platform, which transforms data centers into aggregated computing infrastructures that include CPU, storage, and networking resources. vSphere manages these infrastructures as a unified operating environment, and provides you with the tools to administer the data centers that participate in that environment.

![A diagram of VMware vSphere illustrating the relationship between ESXi hosts, vCenter Server, virtual machines, and vSphere Client](images/GUID-7982B384-EAE8-411F-80B1-467F92755AC0-high.png)

The two core components of vSphere are ESXi and vCenter Server. ESXi is the virtualization platform where you create and run virtual machines and virtual appliances. vCenter Server is the service through which you manage multiple hosts connected in a network and pool host resources.

Want to know what is in the current release of vSphere? Look at the latest vSphere release notes.

## Learn About Some of Our Features

You can [only deploy or upgrade to vCenter Server](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vcenter-installation/GUID-78933728-7F02-43AF-ABD8-0BDCE10418A6.html) using an appliance. The vCenter Server appliance contains all the Platform Services Controller services from earlier releases, preserving all previous functionality, [including authentication, certificate management](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-authentication/GUID-A306AF53-4D49-40E9-8652-24EEC608C8D3.html), and licensing.

vSphere 8.0 introduces [vSphere Distributed Services Engine](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-esxi-installation/GUID-EC3CE886-63A9-4FF0-B79F-111BCB61038F.html) that provides the ability to offload some of the infrastructure functions from a server CPU to a data processing unit (DPU). A DPU device features multiple embedded CPU cores, memory, and a trimmed version of an ESXi hypervisor that runs on the server. DPUs are pre-configured devices that you can use for network acceleration. You [manage the life cycle of the software and firmware that runs on a DPU device](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-lifecycle-manager/GUID-41E34087-A6D0-4B60-A355-5FAC73DCFCF5.html) by using vSphere Lifecycle Manager images workflows.

Use vSphere Lifecycle Manager as a [centralized and simplified lifecycle management mechanism](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-lifecycle-manager/GUID-74295A37-E8BB-4EB9-BFBA-47B78F0C570D.html) for VMware ESXi hosts. With vSphere Lifecycle Manager you can [manage ESXi hosts by using images and baselines](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-lifecycle-manager/GUID-9A20C2DA-F45F-4C9B-9D17-A89BCB62E6EF.html) at the cluster level. You can also [convert a cluster that uses baselines into a cluster that uses vSphere Lifecycle Manager images](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-lifecycle-manager/GUID-B54663AB-B1D1-4E87-8B8C-76FF2998A477.html). In vSphere 8.0 you can start using [vSphere Configuration Profiles](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-lifecycle-manager/GUID-F54C875A-E9EE-44E9-81BB-2E157B1C462A.html) to manage the configuration of the hosts in a cluster collectively. You first set up a desired configuration at the cluster level and then, in a single operation, you can apply the configuration to all hosts in the cluster.

Learn how to use [vSphere with Tanzu](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-with-tanzu-concepts-planning/GUID-70CAF0BB-1722-4526-9CE7-D5C92C15D7D0.html) to transform vSphere into a platform for running Kubernetes workloads natively on the hypervisor layer. With this functionality, you can [enable a vSphere cluster to run Kubernetes workloads by configuring it then as a Supervisor](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-with-tanzu-installation-configuration/GUID-B09BFD99-DF1F-4831-BBA5-BAA78580AB47.html). DevOps engineers and application developers can then run containerized applications on [vSphere Namespaces](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-with-tanzu-services-workloads/GUID-1544C9FE-0B23-434E-B823-C59EFC2F7309.html) by deploying [vSphere Pod](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-with-tanzu-services-workloads/GUID-8574A735-C02D-48BA-A266-FBA7803F7C3A.html), VMs, and upstream Kubernetes clusters through [Tanzu Kubernetes Grid with vSphere](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-with-tanzu-tkg/GUID-9F7CB8D2-DEBD-44ED-9C30-26C49FA0DEC5.html). You can deploy a [Supervisor on vSphere Zones](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-with-tanzu-concepts-planning/GUID-3E4E6039-BD24-4C40-8575-5AA0EECBBBEC.html) to provide [high-availability to your workloads at cluster level](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-with-tanzu-concepts-planning/GUID-376EE3F0-D881-4FF5-9CD3-41341F840035.html) as one vSphere Zone maps to one vSphere cluster. Workloads that you run on a Supervisor deployed on zones are distributed on the vSphere clusters that are part of the zones and are protected against cluster-level failure. To keep your vSphere with Tanzu environment up to date, backup and restore, and troubleshoot, learn how to [maintain vSphere with Tanzu](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-with-tanzu-maintenance/GUID-DDE883B2-E69E-426E-B3E8-6562A583733F.html).

You can [view available vCenter Server updates and upgrades](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vcenter-upgrade/GUID-CDA2C1C8-7286-4978-B344-987BCD91121A.html) and produce interoperability reports about VMware products associated with vCenter Server using Update Planner. You can also [generate pre-update reports](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vcenter-upgrade/GUID-CDA2C1C8-7286-4978-B344-987BCD91121A.html#GUID-E3097303-3F41-42B7-BCD3-E06B1D231328) that let you make sure your system meets the minimum software and hardware requirements for a successful upgrade of vCenter Server. The report provides information about problems that might prevent the completion of a software upgrade, and actions you can take to remedy those problems.

You can use centralized license management to manage licenses for ESXi hosts, vCenter Server, vSAN clusters, and other VMware solutions. Learn how to use the VMware vSphere Client to [manage licenses in your vCenter Server environment](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vcenter-esxi-management/GUID-487AACBF-4E49-43E0-A852-FC23734C0774.html).

Learn how to configure networking for vSphere, including how to [create vSphere distributed switches](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-networking/GUID-375B45C7-684C-4C51-BA3C-70E48DFABF04.html) and [vSphere standard switches](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-networking/GUID-E198C88A-F82C-4FF3-96C9-E3DF0056AD0C.html), monitor networks to [analyze the traffic between virtual machines (VMs) and hosts](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-networking/GUID-6DB73F20-C99A-43D4-9EE0-3277974EF8BF.html), and [manage network resources](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-networking/GUID-D1597704-154D-421F-A618-512B3EA2FFA2.html). vSphere networking is one of the most critical components in your environment, as it is how your ESXi hosts and VMs communicate.

You can [learn about vSphere storage](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-storage/GUID-F602EB17-8D24-400A-9B05-196CEA66464F.html) to help you plan a storage strategy for your virtual data center. You can also learn how to configure and use the [virtualized and software-defined storage technologies](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-storage/GUID-8AE88758-20C1-4873-99C7-181EF9ACFA70.html) that ESXi and vCenter Server provide. vSphere supports several storage technologies for both traditional and software-defined storage environments.

Learn how to secure your environment using [vSphere security features and best practices](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-security/GUID-9E10799B-0F6E-47D5-A59B-983E271EC8C0.html) to safeguard your environment from attack. vSphere provides comprehensive, built-in security, delivering secure applications, infrastructure, data, and access.

You can provide business continuity using [vCenter High Availability](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-availability/GUID-4A626993-A829-495C-9659-F64BA8B560BD.html) (vCenter HA) and [vSphere Fault Tolerance](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-availability/GUID-D9D12472-4BB5-47C9-8AD8-F2EC570B9210.html) (FT). vCenter HA provides failover protection against hardware and operating system outages within your virtualized IT environment. If there is a host failure, Fault Tolerance provides continuous protection for a VM.

You can use resource pools, clusters, [vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-resource-management/GUID-8ACF3502-5314-469F-8CC9-4A9BD5925BC2.html) (DRS), [vSphere Distributed Power Management](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-resource-management/GUID-5E5E349A-4644-4C9C-B434-1C0243EBDC80.html) (DPM), and [vSphere Storage I/O Control](../VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-resource-management/GUID-7686FEC3-1FAC-4DA7-B698-B808C44E5E96.html) to manage and allocate resources for ESXi hosts and vCenter Server.

You can remove a USB controller from the virtual machine if you do not want to connect to USB devices.

## Prerequisites

Note: The
ESXi host supports hot-removal of a USB controller. You can remove a USB controller from a virtual machine when both the
ESXi host and the guest operating system of the virtual machine support the hot-removal functionality.

To make sure that the guest operating system of the virtual machine supports the hot-removal functionality, refer to the vendors documentation.

* Verify that the USB controller is not in use.
* Verify that all USB devices are disconnected from the virtual machine.
* Required Privilege: Virtual Machine.Configuration.Add or Remove Device

## Procedure

1. Navigate to a data center, folder, cluster, resource pool, host, or vApp, click the VMs tab and click Virtual Machines.
2. Right-click a virtual machine and click Edit Settings.
3. On the Virtual Hardware tab, move the pointer over the USB controller and click the Remove icon.
4. Click OK to confirm the deletion and close the dialog box.

## Results

The controller is no longer connected to the virtual machine, but remains available to add at a later time.

**Parent topic:**
[USB Configuration from a Client Computer to a Virtual Machine](GUID-800DA713-FB5F-49AF-9045-F21915AB79C8.html "You can add multiple USB devices to a virtual machine when the physical devices are connected to the client computer on which you run the vSphere Client. The vSphere Client must be logged in to a vCenter Server instance that manages the ESXi host where the virtual machine resides. USB passthrough technology supports adding multiple USB devices, such as security dongles, mass storage devices, and smartcard readers to virtual machines.")
