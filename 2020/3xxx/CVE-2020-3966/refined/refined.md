Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-3966:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-overflow that occurs due to a race condition in the USB 2.0 controller (EHCI) within VMware products.
*   The issue arises from a lack of proper locking mechanisms when performing operations on an object within the EHCI component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** Concurrent access to shared resources without proper synchronization leads to a race condition.
*   **Heap-Overflow:** The race condition leads to a heap overflow, potentially corrupting memory.
*   **Lack of proper locking:** The vulnerability results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can execute arbitrary code on the hypervisor, potentially gaining complete control over the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker with access to a virtual machine can escalate privileges to execute code in the context of the hypervisor.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to a virtual machine running on the affected VMware product.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access to a virtual machine:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a virtual machine that is using the vulnerable EHCI controller.
*   **High-privileged code execution on guest system:** The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Specific Timing (race condition):** Exploiting the race condition might require precise timing, adding complexity to the attack.
*   **Additional conditions** beyond the attacker's control must be present for exploitation to be possible

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Important" severity by VMware, with a CVSSv3 base score of 8.1.
*   A workaround is available that involves removing the USB controller from the virtual machine.
*   Patches are available from VMware to remediate the vulnerability.
*  The vulnerability was reported to VMware by Reno Robert of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
* The Zero Day Initiative advisory notes that the attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.
