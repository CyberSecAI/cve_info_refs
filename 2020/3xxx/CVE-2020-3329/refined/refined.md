Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3329:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an incorrect allocation of the enable/disable action button within the role-based access control code. This leads to a situation where read-only users can improperly modify user roles to disable accounts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper role-based access control.
- Incorrect allocation of privileges, specifically with the enable/disable action.
- Read-only users have the ability to disable accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can disable user accounts, including administrative accounts.
- This could lead to a denial-of-service condition by locking out legitimate users.
- This could disrupt normal operations and cause data loss.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack over a network.
- The attacker needs to authenticate on the vulnerable system as a read-only user to perform the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the affected system.
- The attacker must have valid read-only user credentials to log in to the system.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability in Cisco IMC Supervisor, Cisco UCS Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data allows a read-only authenticated attacker to disable user accounts by exploiting an incorrect allocation of privileges within the role-based access control system. This leads to a medium impact vulnerability as described in the CVSS score.
