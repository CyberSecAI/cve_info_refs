Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability exists because the Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) software allows authenticated users to access resources intended for administrators only.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** The primary weakness is the improper access control mechanism within the DCNM's web-based management interface.  It fails to restrict access to administrative functionalities based on user roles.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass authorization, gaining access to sensitive device information.
- A successful exploit allows the attacker to perform actions as if they had administrative privileges, including:
    - Adding
    - Deleting
    - Editing network configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker must be able to reach the affected device via the network.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web-based management interface of DCNM.
- **Crafted URL:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by submitting a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the DCNM software to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability besides upgrading to a fixed software version.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco DCNM Software releases earlier than Release 11.4(1).
- Fixed versions are 11.4(1) and later.
