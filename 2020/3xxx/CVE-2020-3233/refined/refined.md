- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web interface or access sensitive browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker with valid Local Manager credentials can inject malicious code into a system settings tab.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have valid Local Manager credentials.
