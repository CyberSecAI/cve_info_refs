Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation of HTTP requests processed by the web interface of Cisco ASA and FTD software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The software fails to adequately validate HTTP request data, making it susceptible to crafted inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to an unexpected device reload, rendering the affected device unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker who does not need to authenticate.
*   **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves sending a malicious HTTP request to the affected device's web interface.
*  The vulnerability affects both IPv4 and IPv6 HTTP traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web interface of the Cisco ASA or FTD device.
*   No prior authentication or special privileges are required.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software when specific HTTP features are enabled. These features include Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), Cisco Security Manager, REST API (on ASA), and HTTP service (on FTD).
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability, but there are no workarounds.
*   This vulnerability is part of the October 2020 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication
*   There is a related SSL/TLS Denial of Service vulnerability also affecting ASA software.
*   The CVSS score is 8.6, indicating a high severity issue.
