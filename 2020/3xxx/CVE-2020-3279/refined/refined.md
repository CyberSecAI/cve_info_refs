Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3279:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The web-based management interface of the affected Cisco Small Business routers does not properly validate user-supplied input to scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the affected device.
*   **Root Privileges:** The executed commands have root privileges, giving the attacker full control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Management Interface:** The vulnerabilities are exploited through the web-based management interface of the routers.
*   **Malicious HTTP Requests:** Attackers send malicious requests to the affected device to trigger the command injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs administrative privileges sufficient to log in to the web-based management interface.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web management interface which can be local LAN access or remote if remote management is enabled on the device.
*   **Authenticated:** The attacker must be authenticated on the web-based management interface.

**Summary of CVE-2020-3279:**
This CVE refers to a command injection vulnerability in the web-based management interface of certain Cisco Small Business RV series routers. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation, which can allow an authenticated attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system by sending specially crafted HTTP requests.

The content also specifies that proof-of-concept exploit code is available and no workarounds exist, thus the only remediation is to update to the fixed software versions.
The affected products and firmware versions are:

*   RV016 Multi-WAN VPN: 4.2.3.10 and earlier
