Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3811:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `qmail-verify` handles mail address verification. Specifically, it fails to initialize its configuration correctly, leading to a bypass.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Mail Address Verification Bypass:** `qmail-verify` does not call the `control_init()` function, causing it to use a hardcoded default domain "envnoathost". Because of this, it accepts any unqualified mail address (without a domain) as valid by default because its default domain "envnoathost" is not one of qmail's local domains, and is therefore unverifiable. This bypass allows an attacker to potentially send emails to addresses that should normally be rejected, such as specially crafted local addresses designed to execute commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of intended mail address restrictions**:  An attacker can bypass the intended restrictions on mail addresses enforced by `qmail-verify`. This allows specially crafted local addresses to bypass filtering and be accepted by the mail system

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `qmail-verify` service. An attacker would need to send a mail to a specially crafted email address to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send an email to a vulnerable server that uses the `qmail-verify` program in conjunction with `qmail`.
