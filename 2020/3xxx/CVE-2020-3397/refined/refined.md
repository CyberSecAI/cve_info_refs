Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incomplete input validation of a specific type of BGP MVPN update message within the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Multicast VPN (MVPN) implementation of Cisco NX-OS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incomplete Input Validation:** The software fails to properly validate a specific type of BGP MVPN update message. This lack of validation allows a specially crafted message to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **CWE-20:** The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-20, which refers to "Improper Input Validation."

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause the affected device to unexpectedly reload.
*   **System Restart:** The exploit triggers multiple restarts of BGP-related routing applications, eventually leading to a system-level restart.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
*   **Network:** The attacker sends the crafted BGP MVPN update message over an established TCP connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Trusted BGP Peer Spoofing:** The attacker must send the crafted message over an established TCP connection, making it appear as if it's coming from a trusted BGP peer.
*   **Knowledge of BGP Peers:** The attacker needs to have prior knowledge of the BGP peers in the targeted system's trusted network to successfully spoof the source of the malicious BGP update message.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:**
    *   Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches
    *   Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode
*   **Vulnerable Conditions:**
    *   `feature ngmvpn` must be configured.
    *   At least one BGP neighbor (peer) must be configured.
    *   The BGP connection must be configured for MPVN under the BGP neighbor.
*   **BGP Port:** BGP packets are processed on TCP port 179 (IPv4 and IPv6).
*   **Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability besides patching.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a base CVSS score of 8.6, categorized as HIGH severity.
