Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3702:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `ath9k` driver, which is responsible for handling Atheros IEEE 802.11n family chipsets. This driver flaw allows for information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure**: The core issue is a flaw in the `ath9k` driver that leads to the disclosure of sensitive information. Specifically, this occurs when the Access Point is configured to operate using the WPA2 or the WPA/WPA2 mixed-mode security standards on the 2.4 GHz band.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Exposure**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially intercept and read transmitted data that should be encrypted, thus exposing sensitive information.
*   **Temporary unencrypted transmission:** Wi-Fi traffic may be temporarily transmitted without encryption.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network proximity**: The attacker needs to be within the Wi-Fi range of a vulnerable access point.
*   **Traffic Interception**: The attacker can listen to wireless communication and intercept the unencrypted Wi-Fi traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Proximity**: The attacker must be within the wireless range of the affected AP.
*   **Passive Monitoring**: No special capabilities are needed other than the ability to capture wireless traffic using a suitable receiver. No active interaction with the vulnerable system is required.

**Additional details from the Arista advisory:**

*   **Specific conditions for vulnerability:**
    *   APs using WPA2 or WPA/WPA2 mixed-mode encryption.
    *   Wi-Fi traffic is bridged using the 2.4GHz radio.
    *   The specific AP model is listed as vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Disabling the 2.4GHz band on the affected AP.
    *   Using application-layer encryption (e.g. TLS).
*  **Affected platforms:**
    * Arista Wireless Access Point platforms: AV2, C-75/C75-E, O-90/O90E, W-68

**Note:** The Debian Security Advisories (DSA and DLA) also mention CVE-2020-3702 as a vulnerability in the Linux kernel which affects the `ath9k` driver.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description by outlining the specific conditions required for the vulnerability to be exploited and by giving a specific example of how this attack could occur in the Arista Wireless Access Points. It also provides workarounds and resolutions.
