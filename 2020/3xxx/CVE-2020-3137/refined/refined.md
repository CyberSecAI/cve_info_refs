Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3137

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the web-based management interface of Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) not properly validating user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) due to improper input validation in the web-based management interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary script code within the context of the affected interface.
*   The attacker may gain access to sensitive, browser-based information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:** The attacker does not need to have an account or be on the same network as the affected device.
*   **User Interaction:** Requires persuading a user to click on a malicious link that triggers the XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious link containing the XSS payload.
*   The attacker must be able to deliver the crafted link to a user of the web-based management interface.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting issue in the web management interface of Cisco ESA devices. An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a vulnerable page by crafting a malicious URL and tricking a legitimate user into visiting it. The injected code can then be used to perform various malicious actions such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or defacing the management interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco ESA releases 13.0 and earlier.
*   No workarounds are available.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS score is 6.1 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
