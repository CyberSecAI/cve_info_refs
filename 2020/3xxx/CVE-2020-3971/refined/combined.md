##### **3j. Heap overflow vulnerability in vmxnet3 (CVE-2020-3971)**

**Description**

VMware ESXi, Fusion and Workstation contain a heap overflow vulnerability in the vmxnet3 virtual network adapter. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the Moderate severity range with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [5.9](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).

**Known Attack Vectors**

A malicious actor with local access to a virtual machine with a vmxnet3 network adapter present may be able to read privileged information contained in hypervisor memory from a virtual machine. Additional conditions beyond the attacker's control need to be present for exploitation to be possible.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2020-3971 apply the patches listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' found below.

**Workarounds**

None.

**Additional Documentation**

None.

**Acknowledgements**

VMware would like to thank Tianwen Tang(VictorV) of Qihoo 360Vulcan Team for reporting this issue to us.

You can remove a USB controller from the virtual machine if you do not want to connect to USB devices.

## Prerequisites

Note: The
ESXi host supports hot-removal of a USB controller. You can remove a USB controller from a virtual machine when both the
ESXi host and the guest operating system of the virtual machine support the hot-removal functionality.

To make sure that the guest operating system of the virtual machine supports the hot-removal functionality, refer to the vendors documentation.

* Verify that the USB controller is not in use.
* Verify that all USB devices are disconnected from the virtual machine.
* Required Privilege: Virtual Machine.Configuration.Add or Remove Device

## Procedure

1. Navigate to a data center, folder, cluster, resource pool, host, or vApp, click the VMs tab and click Virtual Machines.
2. Right-click a virtual machine and click Edit Settings.
3. On the Virtual Hardware tab, move the pointer over the USB controller and click the Remove icon.
4. Click OK to confirm the deletion and close the dialog box.

## Results

The controller is no longer connected to the virtual machine, but remains available to add at a later time.

**Parent topic:**
[USB Configuration from a Client Computer to a Virtual Machine](GUID-800DA713-FB5F-49AF-9045-F21915AB79C8.html "You can add multiple USB devices to a virtual machine when the physical devices connect to a client computer on which the vSphere Client is running. The vSphere Client must be logged in to an instance of vCenter Server that manages the ESXi host where the virtual machines reside. USB passthrough technology supports adding multiple USB devices, such as security dongles, mass storage devices, and smartcard readers to virtual machines.")
