The provided content is related to CVE-2020-3479.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) update messages that contain crafted Ethernet VPN (EVPN) attributes within the Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) implementation for the Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN) EVPN address family.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of malformed EVPN attributes in BGP update messages.
- Lack of proper validation or sanitization of the crafted EVPN attributes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit can cause the affected device to crash, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending BGP update messages with specific, malformed EVPN attributes to an affected device.
- The malicious BGP update message must originate from a configured, valid BGP peer or be injected into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a valid BGP peer of the affected device or have the ability to inject crafted BGP updates via a valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device.
