Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3499:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the **improper handling of system resource values** by the licensing service within Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Resource Handling:** The core issue is that the software does not manage system resources properly, which can be exploited.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerability exists in the licensing service, and it appears that the system does not properly validate or handle the incoming requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the affected system to become unresponsive.
*   **Management Disruption:** The DoS condition prevents the management of dependent devices. The FMC is a central management platform, so a DoS attack effectively disrupts the entire security infrastructure it controls.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Network-Based:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **Malicious Requests:** Exploitation involves sending specially crafted malicious requests to the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated, Remote Access:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges to send the malicious requests and trigger the vulnerability. They can be located anywhere on the network.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco FMC Software running on any Cisco device that uses connected licensing.
*   **Unaffected Products:** Cisco ASA and FTD Software are not affected by this specific vulnerability.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability, making patching the primary remediation.
*   **Fix:** Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 8.6, indicating a high severity.
*   **Internal Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing by Cisco.
