Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by improper input validation of parameters within an HTTP request to the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Open Redirect: The core issue is an open redirect vulnerability (CWE-601). This means the application can be manipulated to redirect users to an arbitrary URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can redirect users to malicious web pages.
- This can be used in phishing attacks, where users are tricked into visiting malicious sites disguised as legitimate ones.
- The attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information or install malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out remotely over the network.
- It involves intercepting an HTTP request from a user interacting with the Cisco FMC web interface.
- By modifying the intercepted request, an attacker can control the redirection URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability, it is unauthenticated.
- The attacker needs the capability to intercept HTTP requests from a user of the vulnerable system.
- No special privileges are required to perform the attack.
