The content is related to CVE-2020-3442.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The DuoConnect client, when configured with an insecure "http://" relay URL, sends authentication tokens over an unencrypted HTTP connection to the Duo Network Gateway (DNG).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (authentication tokens).
- Insecure configuration option allowing the use of HTTP instead of HTTPS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who can monitor network traffic can capture authentication tokens.
- These captured tokens can be used to bypass DNG authentication.
- This provides unauthorized network-level access to SSH servers protected by the DNG.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network sniffing on the same network as the vulnerable DuoConnect client and DNG instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to monitor network traffic.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability after the authentication token is captured.
