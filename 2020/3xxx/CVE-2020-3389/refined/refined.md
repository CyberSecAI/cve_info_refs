Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3389:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists because sensitive information, specifically the password configured during installation, is stored in clear text on the affected Cisco Hyperflex HX-Series Software device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The core issue is the storage of the installation password without any encryption or obfuscation. This directly violates fundamental security practices.
- **Lack of Access Control:** While the attacker needs local access, the vulnerability suggests that once access is obtained, there aren't sufficient controls to prevent navigation to the directory containing the sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to retrieve the installation password in clear text.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** The revealed password could be used for further attacks, potentially granting broader system access or compromising other services relying on the same credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be able to authenticate to the system. The provided text says "authenticated, local attacker". This suggests a legitimate user account, which may indicate an insider threat or a compromised account, is required.
- **File System Access:** The attacker must be able to navigate the file system to the directory storing the sensitive information.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-3389 describes a vulnerability in Cisco Hyperflex HX-Series Software where the installation password is stored in clear text. An attacker with local authenticated access can exploit this to retrieve the password, potentially leading to further system compromise. The vulnerability is due to insecure storage of sensitive information and insufficient access control to protect that information. The provided information is more descriptive than the placeholder CVE description, which was provided as part of the prompt.
