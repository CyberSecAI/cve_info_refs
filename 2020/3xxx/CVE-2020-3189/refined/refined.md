Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3189:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the VPN System Logging functionality of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.
- System memory is not properly released (memory leak) when a VPN System Logging event is generated during the creation or deletion of a VPN session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The core issue is a memory leak caused by failure to free allocated memory after logging a VPN session event. This can deplete system resources over time.
- **Unauthenticated Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
- **Default Configuration:** VPN System Logging is enabled by default, making vulnerable systems susceptible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to system memory depletion.
- **System Instability:** The memory exhaustion causes unexpected system behaviors.
- **Device Crashes:** In severe cases, the device may crash due to memory depletion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network connection.
- **Repeated VPN Connection Manipulation:** The attacker repeatedly creates or deletes VPN tunnel connections to trigger the logging events that lead to the memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate network connections to the vulnerable Cisco FTD device.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **VPN Tunnel Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be capable of creating and deleting VPN tunnels to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects specific Cisco FTD Software releases: 6.2.3.12, 6.2.3.13, 6.2.3.14, and 6.2.3.15.
- A workaround is available by disabling the VPN System Logging feature.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability, with specific fixed versions listed.
- The vulnerability was discovered during a Cisco TAC support case.
