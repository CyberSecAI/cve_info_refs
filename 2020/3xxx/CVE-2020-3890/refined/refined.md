- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an issue in how Messages handles deletion of message groups, which can lead to them being suggested for autocompletion even after deletion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A logic flaw exists in message group deletion, causing deleted groups to still be accessible by the autocomplete function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A user could potentially view information about message groups that they had previously deleted.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a user interacting with the messaging application's autocompletion function after deleting message groups.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user of the device.
