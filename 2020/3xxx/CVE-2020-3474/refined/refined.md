Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis of CVE-2020-3474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web management framework of Cisco IOS XE Software. Specifically, crafted HTTP packets can trigger the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The software fails to properly validate the data within incoming HTTP packets. This lack of validation allows attackers to send malicious requests that can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the web management software to hang or crash, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition. This requires a restart of the device to regain functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Remote, authenticated attacker.
*   The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated with read-only privileges to the targeted device.
*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP packets to the affected device.
