Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3223:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient file scope limiting in the web-based user interface (web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The web UI does not properly restrict access to files on the device's filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can read arbitrary files from the underlying operating system's filesystem of the affected device. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, user credentials, or other confidential data stored on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely via the web UI.
*   **File Reference Creation:** The attacker needs to create a specific file reference on the filesystem and then access it through the web UI. The specific method of creating the file reference is not provided but is necessary for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have administrative privileges on the affected Cisco IOS XE device. This means the attacker must be able to log in to the device using valid admin credentials.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the device's web UI remotely over the network.
*   **User Interaction:** Although the CVSS score includes User Interaction as "Required," the description says the attacker needs to create a specific file reference and then access it through the Web UI, this may or may not involve user interaction on the target device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present only when the web UI is enabled on the Cisco IOS XE Software device.
*   The advisory provides a method to determine if the HTTP server is enabled through the CLI using the command `show running-config | include ip http server|secure|active`.
*   If `ip http active-session-modules none` is configured alongside `ip http server`, the vulnerability is not exploitable over HTTP. Similarly, `ip http secure-active-session-modules none` mitigates the vulnerability over HTTPS.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
*   There are no workarounds for this vulnerability; a software update is required to fix the issue.
*   The provided CVSS score is 4.5, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
