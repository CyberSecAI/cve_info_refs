Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability exists due to the web-based management interface of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director not properly validating user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The web interface is susceptible to directory traversal attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to read files on the underlying operating system with root privileges. This could potentially expose sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending crafted HTTP requests.
- **HTTP Request:** The attack involves crafting a malicious HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences (e.g., "../").

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Privileges:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges on the affected system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Authenticated:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the web-based management interface.

**Summary of CVE-2020-3490:**

The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in the web-based management interface of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director. It allows an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to read files on the system, potentially with root access, due to improper input validation. The vulnerability can be exploited using crafted HTTP requests containing directory traversal sequences.
