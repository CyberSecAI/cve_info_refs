**Attack Vectors:**
- The document does not specify how the out-of-bounds write occurs (e.g., file parsing, network interaction), but it's within Adobe Framemaker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger the out-of-bounds write condition within the vulnerable version of Adobe Framemaker. It's likely an attacker would need to get a specially crafted document into the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The document lists CVE-2020-3736 alongside several other CVEs, all related to vulnerabilities in Adobe Framemaker that lead to arbitrary code execution.
- The bulletin indicates that Adobe Framemaker versions 2019.0.4 and below are affected and that users should upgrade to version 2019.0.5.
