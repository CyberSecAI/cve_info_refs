Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3230

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of crafted IKEv2 *SA-Init* packets within the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) implementation of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core issue lies in the software's failure to correctly process specifically crafted IKEv2 *SA-Init* packets. This allows an attacker to exploit a weakness in the IKEv2 negotiation process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. By sending a stream of these crafted packets, an attacker can cause the affected device to reach its maximum incoming negotiation limits. Consequently, the device becomes unable to establish new IKEv2 security associations, effectively blocking legitimate VPN connections. The device will become unresponsive and require a power cycle to restore service

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The attack is network-based, meaning the attacker can be remote.
-   The attacker targets IKEv2 communications on specific UDP ports: 500, 848, 4500, and 4848, using either IPv4 or IPv6.
-   The attacker sends specially crafted IKEv2 *SA-Init* packets to the affected Cisco device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker must have network connectivity to the target device.
-   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
-   The attacker must be able to send UDP packets to the affected device on the vulnerable ports.
-   The attacker needs the capability to generate and send crafted IKEv2 *SA-Init* packets.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects devices configured with IKEv2 features.
*   Devices configured with only IKEv1 are not affected.
*   There are no workarounds.
*   If the device reaches the maximum negotiation limit, a power cycle is required to recover the device.
*   The advisory provides details on how to determine if a device is configured to process IKEv2 traffic.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability and provides a tool to check a device's vulnerability.
*   Cisco IOS XR Software and Cisco NX-OS Software are not affected by the vulnerability.
