Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-3416:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerabilities stem from incorrect validations by boot scripts during the bootup process of Cisco IOS XE Software on Cisco ASR 900 Series Aggregation Services Routers with a Route Switch Processor 3 (RSP3). These incorrect validations occur when specific ROM monitor (ROMMON) variables are set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Validation:** The boot scripts do not properly validate the ROMMON variables, allowing for manipulation. This is a weakness related to CWE-749.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  By manipulating ROMMON variables, an attacker can execute arbitrary code during bootup.
*   **Chain of Trust Break:** The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to break the chain of trust by injecting code at the boot level.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Persistent Code Execution:** An attacker can execute persistent code at bootup, meaning the malicious code will run every time the device restarts.
*   **Root Privileges:**  A successful exploit allows the attacker to gain *root* privileges on the underlying operating system (OS).
*   **Full System Compromise:** With root privileges, an attacker can potentially take full control of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the device.
*   **File Copy:** The attacker needs to copy a specific file to the local file system of the device.
*   **ROMMON Variable Manipulation:** The attacker needs to define specific ROMMON variables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:**  The attacker must be an authenticated user with high privileges. This implies that the attacker is either:
    *   Has access to the root shell on the device, or
    *   Has physical access to the device.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge to copy specific files and set specific ROMMON variables.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco ASR 900 Series Aggregation Services Routers with an RSP3 installed running a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a base CVSS score of 6.7, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Fixed Software:**  Cisco has released software updates that address the vulnerabilities.
*   **Discovery:** The vulnerabilities were discovered during internal security testing by Victor Kamensky of Cisco and X.B. of the Cisco Advanced Security Initiatives Group (ASIG).
