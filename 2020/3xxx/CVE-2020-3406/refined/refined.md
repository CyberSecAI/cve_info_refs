**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where the lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious script code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the web interface.
*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive browser-based information from the victim user.
