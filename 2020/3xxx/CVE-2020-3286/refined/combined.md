The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient boundary restrictions on user-supplied input to scripts in the web-based management interface. An attacker with administrative privileges that are sufficient to log in to the web-based management interface could exploit each vulnerability by sending crafted requests that contain overly large values to an affected device, causing a stack overflow. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to crash or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with *root* privileges on the underlying operating system.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-routers-stack-vUxHmnNz>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco Small Business routers and firmware releases:    + RV016 Multi-WAN VPN: 4.2.3.10 and earlier   + RV042 Dual WAN VPN: 4.2.3.10 and earlier   + RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN: 4.2.3.10 and earlier   + RV082 Dual WAN VPN: 4.2.3.10 and earlier   + RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN: 1.5.1.05 and earlier   + RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN: 1.5.1.05 and earlier The web-based management interface for these devices is available through a local LAN connection or through the remote management feature. By default, the remote management feature is disabled for the affected devices.  To determine whether the remote management feature is enabled for a device, open the web-based management interface through a local LAN connection and then choose **Basic Settings > Remote Management**. If the **Enable** check box is checked, remote management is enabled for the device. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Cisco fixed these vulnerabilities in Cisco RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers Firmware Release 1.5.1.11.  Cisco fixed these vulnerabilities in Cisco RV016, RV042, and RV082 Routers Firmware Release 4.2.3.14.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is aware that proof-of-concept exploit code is available for the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.  The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.  Source  * Cisco would like to thank Kai Cheng for reporting these vulnerabilities.
