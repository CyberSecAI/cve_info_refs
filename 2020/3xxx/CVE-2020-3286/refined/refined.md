- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient boundary restrictions on user-supplied input to scripts in the web-based management interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the device to crash or execute arbitrary code with *root* privileges on the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges can send crafted requests containing overly large values to the affected device through the web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrative privileges and be able to access the web-based management interface of the affected device. This can be done through a local LAN connection or through the remote management feature.
