Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3308:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper verification of digital signatures for patch images in Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Signature Bypass:** The system fails to properly validate the digital signatures of software patch images before installation. This allows an attacker to bypass signature checks by using an unsigned software patch.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Software Installation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to install and boot a malicious software patch image on the affected device. This could potentially grant the attacker complete control over the device, leading to various malicious activities such as data theft, denial of service, or further network compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Software Patch Loading:** The attack involves crafting an unsigned software patch and loading it onto the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level credentials on the affected device to install the crafted patch.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco FTD Software releases earlier than Release 6.2.2.1.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability besides upgrading to the fixed software version.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
- Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FMC Software are not affected by this vulnerability.
