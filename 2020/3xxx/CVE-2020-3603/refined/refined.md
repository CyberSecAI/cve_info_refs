Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3603:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of certain elements within a Webex recording stored in the Advanced Recording Format (ARF). This lack of validation can lead to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The primary weakness is the ability to write data outside the boundaries of an allocated buffer, caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within ARF files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious ARF file: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a user a malicious ARF file, either through a link or as an email attachment.
- User interaction: The user must be persuaded to open the malicious ARF file with the affected Cisco Webex software on their local system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify ARF files to include the malicious data that triggers the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious ARF file to the victim and entice them to open it with a vulnerable version of Cisco Webex Network Recording Player.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects both Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Windows and Cisco Webex Player for Windows.
- This vulnerability is related to the parsing of ARF files and the insufficient validation of user-supplied data.
- The vulnerability is rated as HIGH with a CVSS base score of 7.8.
- The vulnerability was reported by Francis Provencher (PRL) working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability, and there are no available workarounds.
- The affected products include Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco Webex Meetings Server with versions prior to the first fixed releases.
- The provided CVSS vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
