"text": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Windows and Cisco Webex Player for Windows could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of certain elements of a Webex recording that is stored in the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-nbr-NOS6FQ24 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-nbr-NOS6FQ24\"]"

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.8 |

The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of certain elements of a Webex recording that is stored in the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-nbr-NOS6FQ24>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products    These vulnerabilities affect the following releases of Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Windows and Cisco Webex Player for Windows, which are available from Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco Webex Meetings Server:    + Cisco Webex Meetings: All Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player releases earlier than the first fixed release   + Cisco Webex Meetings Server: All Webex Network Recording Player releases earlier than the first fixed release To determine which release of Cisco Webex Network Recording Player or Cisco Webex Player is installed on a system, open the player and choose **Help** > **About**.

Details  * Cisco Webex Meetings is a hosted, multimedia conferencing solution that is managed and maintained by Cisco Webex. Cisco Webex Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers host, manage, and maintain in their private clouds.  Cisco Webex Meetings services can be configured to allow users to store meeting recordings online and download those recordings as ARF files. These services can also be configured to allow users to record meetings directly on their local computers as WRF files.  Cisco Webex Network Recording Player is the application that is used to play back ARF files. It is available from Cisco Webex Meetings sites and Cisco Webex Meetings Server. The player can be installed manually from a user’s Cisco Webex website download page in Classic view, or from the Cisco Webex [Video Recording](https://www.webex.com/video-recording.html "Cisco Webex Video Recording download") page.  Cisco Webex Player is the application that is used to play back WRF files. It is available from Cisco Webex Meetings sites. It is not available from Cisco Webex Meetings Server.

Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table:       | Cisco Webex Platform | First Fixed Release |   | --- | --- |   | Webex Meetings 40.6.x sites | 40.6.11 |   | Webex Meetings sites | 40.8.0 |   | Webex Meetings Server 3.x | 3.0MR3 SP4 |   | Webex Meetings Server 4.x | 4.0MR3 SP3 |       **Note:** Bug ID CSCvu59610 (CVE-2020-3604) affects only Cisco Webex Meetings 40.6.x and 40.7.x sites and earlier.
