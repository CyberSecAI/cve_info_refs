Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper input sanitization in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software. Specifically, a crafted file upload to the web UI bypasses proper sanitization allowing for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The core issue is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the system. This is possible due to the lack of adequate input sanitization when handling uploaded files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the affected device.
- **Root Privileges:** These commands are executed with root privileges, giving the attacker complete control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- **Web UI:** The attack vector is the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software. An attacker uploads a specially crafted file through the web UI interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the device's web UI.
- **HTTP Server Feature Enabled:** The device must have the HTTP Server feature enabled (either `ip http server` or `ip http secure-server`). Note that `ip http active-session-modules none` or `ip http secure-active-session-modules none` in the configuration mitigates the issue over HTTP and HTTPS respectively.
- **File Upload:** The attacker needs to be able to upload a malicious file to the web UI.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects devices running Cisco IOS XE Software with the HTTP Server feature enabled.
- There are no workarounds to fully address the vulnerability. However, disabling the HTTP Server feature mitigates the attack vector.
- The issue was found during internal security testing.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2020-3212 and assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 7.2.
