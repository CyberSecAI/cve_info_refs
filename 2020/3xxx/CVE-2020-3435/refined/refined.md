Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3435:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the interprocess communication (IPC) channel of the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate the data received through the IPC channel, allowing an attacker to send crafted messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to modify VPN profile files on the affected Windows system. This could potentially enable the attacker to redirect connections, intercept traffic, or cause other security-related issues by controlling the VPN profile.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the Windows system.
- **Crafted IPC Message:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted IPC message to the AnyConnect process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target Windows system.
- **Valid Credentials:** The attacker requires valid user credentials on the Windows system. This implies that they have already gained some level of access to the machine.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows releases 4.9.00086 and earlier.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.5, classified as "Medium" severity.
