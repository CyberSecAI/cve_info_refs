Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3451:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient user input validation within the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers. Specifically, the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string in the `fileparam` parameter provided to the `upload.cgi` endpoint before using it to execute a system call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command injection vulnerability. The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into a system call.
- Insufficient boundary restrictions on user-supplied input, leading to potential buffer overflows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Remote attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system (OS) as a restricted user (www-data user context).
- Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to temporarily degrade the performance of the interface process or execute arbitrary code on the underlying OS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-adjacent attackers can exploit this vulnerability.
- Malicious requests can be sent to the affected device via the web-based management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authentication to the web interface is required to exploit the vulnerability.
-  The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device.
-  For the second vulnerability CVE-2020-3453, the attacker does not need to be authenticated.
