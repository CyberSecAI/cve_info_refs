- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect pairing implementation between the vRealize Operations for Horizon Adapter and Horizon View.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker with network access to vRealize Operations can obtain sensitive information which can be used to bypass the adapter authentication mechanism.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Unauthenticated remote attacker with network access to vRealize Operations with the Horizon Adapter running.
