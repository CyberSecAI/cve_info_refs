"text": "Update from October 23, 2020: Cisco has become aware of a new Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance vulnerability that could affect the fixed releases recommended for code trains 9.13 and 9.14 in the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory. See the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software SSL/TLS Denial of Service Vulnerability [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ssl-dos-7uZWwSEy\"] for additional information.\r\n\r\nMultiple vulnerabilities in the secure boot process of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for the Firepower 1000 Series and Firepower 2100 Series Appliances could allow an authenticated, local attacker to bypass the secure boot mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities are due to insufficient protections of the secure boot process. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting code into specific files that are then referenced during the device boot process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to break the chain of trust and inject code into the boot process of the device, which would be executed at each boot and maintain persistence across reboots.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n"

"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases and the right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerabilities described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nASA Software for Firepower 1000 Series and Firepower 2100 Series\r\n Cisco ASA Software Release First Fixed Release for these Vulnerabilities 9.8 9.8.4.26 9.9 9.9.2.80 9.10 9.10.1.43 9.12 9.12.4.3 9.13 9.13.1.13 9.14 9.14.1.15\r\nNote: Firepower 1000 Series Appliances were first supported in ASA Software Release 9.13 and Firepower 2100 Series Appliances were first supported in ASA Software Release 9.8.\r\n\r\nFTD Software for Firepower 1000 Series and Firepower 2100 Series\r\n Cisco FTD Software Release First Fixed Release for these Vulnerabilities Earlier than 6.2.21 Migrate to a fixed release. 6.2.2 Migrate to a fixed release. 6.2.3 Migrate to a fixed release. 6.3.0 6.3.0.6 (future release) 6.4.0 6.4.0.10 6.5.0 6.5.0.5 (future release) 6.6.0 6.6.1\r\nNote: Firepower 1000 Series Appliances were first supported on FTD Software Release 6.4.0 and Firepower 2100 Series appliances were first supported on FTD Software Release 6.2.1.\r\n\r\n1. Cisco FMC and FTD Software releases 6.0.1 and earlier, as well as releases 6.2.0 and 6.2.1, have reached end of software maintenance. Customers are advised to migrate to a supported release that includes the fix for these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nTo upgrade to a fixed release of Cisco FTD Software, do one of the following:\r\n\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), use the FMC interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy.\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), use the FDM interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy."

See the [Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software SSL/TLS Denial of Service Vulnerability](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ssl-dos-7uZWwSEy) for additional information.       ---       Multiple vulnerabilities in the secure boot process of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for the Firepower 1000 Series and Firepower 2100 Series Appliances could allow an authenticated, local attacker to bypass the secure boot mechanism.  The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient protections of the secure boot process. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting code into specific files that are then referenced during the device boot process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to break the chain of trust and inject code into the boot process of the device, which would be executed at each boot and maintain persistence across reboots.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fxos-sbbyp-KqP6NgrE>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software when running on the following products:    + Firepower 1000 Series Appliances   + Firepower 2100 Series Appliances For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  For the Firepower 4100 Series Appliances and Firepower 9300 Series Appliances running FXOS, see the following advisory:  <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fxos-sbbp-XTuPkYTn> Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV:Â Local AV:Â Adjacent AV:Â Network AV:Â Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC:Â Low AC:Â High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR:Â None PR:Â Low PR:Â High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI:Â Required UI:Â None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S:Â Unchanged S:Â Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C:Â None C:Â Low C:Â High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I:Â None I:Â Low I:Â High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A:Â None A:Â Low A:Â High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 6.7 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E:Â Unproven  E:Â Proof-of-Concept  E:Â Functional  E:Â High  E:Â Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL:Â Official-Fix  RL:Â Temporary-Fix  RL:Â Workaround  RL:Â Unavailable  RL:Â Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC:Â Unknown  RC:Â Reasonable  RC:Â Confirmed  RC:Â Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.7 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR:Â Low  CR:Â Medium  CR:Â Not Defined  CR:Â High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR:Â Low  IR:Â Medium  IR:Â Not Defined  IR:Â High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR:Â Low  AR:Â Medium  AR:Â Not Defined  AR:Â High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV:Â Local  MAV:Â Adjacent  MAV:Â Network  MAV:Â Physical  MAV:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC:Â Low  MAC:Â High  MAC:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR:Â None  MPR:Â Low  MPR:Â High  MPR:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI:Â Required  MUI:Â None  MUI:Â Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS:Â Unchanged  MS:Â Changed  MS:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC:Â None  MC:Â Low  MC:Â High  MC:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI:Â None  MI:Â Low  MI:Â High  MI:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA:Â None  MA:Â Low  MA:Â High  MA:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 6.7 |
