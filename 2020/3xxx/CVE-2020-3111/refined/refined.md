**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from missing checks when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) messages on Cisco IP Phones.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of proper validation of data within CDP packets.
- This allows for the injection of malicious data through a crafted CDP packet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) with root privileges on the affected IP Phone.
- Denial of Service (DoS) via a reload of the affected IP Phone.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs by sending a crafted CDP packet to the targeted IP phone.
- The attacker must be in the same broadcast domain (Layer 2 adjacent) as the vulnerable device, as CDP is a Layer 2 protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated attacker.
- Must be on the same Layer 2 network segment as the targeted Cisco IP Phone.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects various Cisco IP Phone models when CDP is enabled (which is default for most models).
- The advisory includes a list of specific vulnerable products and firmware releases.
- No workarounds are available, and software updates are required to remediate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS base score of 8.8 (High) with the vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
- Cisco credits Ben Seri, VP of Research at Armis, for discovering and reporting the vulnerability.
