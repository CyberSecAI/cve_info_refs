Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3448:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient enforcement of access control within the Cisco Cyber Vision Center Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Access control bypass: The software fails to properly restrict access to internal services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Bypassing authentication: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms.
- Access to internal services: Attackers can gain access to internal services running on the affected device.
- Impact on monitoring: Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to impact the monitoring of sensors managed by the software. This could involve disrupting the monitoring process, altering data collected, or preventing monitoring altogether.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- Direct access: The attacker directly accesses the internal services of the affected device.
- Unauthenticated: The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the affected device to directly access its internal services.
- No authentication needed: The attacker does not require any credentials or privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary of findings:**
This vulnerability allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass access controls in Cisco Cyber Vision Center Software. Exploitation allows the attacker to access internal services and potentially interfere with the monitoring of sensors.
