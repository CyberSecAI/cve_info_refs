Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3399:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation during the processing of Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer over-read: The lack of proper input validation can lead to a buffer over-read when processing a crafted CAPWAP packet. This happens because the code attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A successful exploit can cause the affected device to crash and reload, leading to a DoS condition. This means the device becomes unavailable for normal operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated, remote attacker: The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges on the target device. They can launch the attack remotely over the network.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted CAPWAP packet to an affected device.
