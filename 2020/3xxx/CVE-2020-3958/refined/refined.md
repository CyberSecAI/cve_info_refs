{
  "CVE-2020-3958": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a malformed pixel shader instruction `ROUND_NI O7., R7.XYZW` where `O7` is an output data register.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Denial-of-service vulnerability due to a panic condition when processing a crafted pixel shader instruction, leading to a crash of the `vmware-vmx.exe` process on the host.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service on the VMware host by crashing the `vmware-vmx.exe` process. This can be triggered from the guest OS.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a specially crafted pixel shader, either through the VMware guest OS or potentially through WEBGL (remote website).",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs access to a virtual machine with 3D graphics enabled. This is enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion but not on ESXi. The attacker can be a non-administrative user within the guest OS."
