| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.6 |

"text": "A vulnerability in the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) implementation of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper memory protection mechanisms while processing certain OSPF packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of malformed OSPF packets in a short period of time to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition for client traffic that is traversing the device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-ospf-dos-RhMQY8qx [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-ospf-dos-RhMQY8qx\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the May 2020 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 12 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 12 vulnerabilities.

"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco products that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software that is configured to support OSPF routing with LLS block processing enabled. Note: LLS block processing is enabled by default.\r\n Determine Whether OSPF Routing Is Configured on an ASA Device\r\nTo determine whether OSPF routing is configured on an ASA device, administrators can use the show ospf privileged mode command. If no output is returned, OSPF routing is not configured. In the following example, the device is configured for OSPF routing:\r\n\r\n\r\nasa# show ospf\r\n Routing Process ���ospf 2��� with ID 10.1.89.2 and Domain ID 0.0.0.2 Supports only single TOS(TOS0) routes Supports opaque LSA . . .\r\n Determine Whether OSPF Routing Is Configured on an FTD Device\r\nTo determine whether OSPF routing is configured on an FTD device, administrators can do one of the following:\r\n\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), choose Devices > Device Management, select the device of interest, and then choose Routing > OSPF. If either Process 1 or Process 2 has a check mark, OSPF is enabled on the device.\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), choose Device > Advanced Configuration > View Configuration > Smart CLI > Routing. If there is an object with the type of OSPF, then OSPF is enabled on the device.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-asa-ospf-lsa-dos#fs\"] section of this advisory."

The vulnerability is due to improper memory protection mechanisms while processing certain OSPF packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of malformed OSPF packets in a short period of time to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition for client traffic that is traversing the device.  Cisco has released software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-ospf-dos-RhMQY8qx>  This advisory is part of the May 2020 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 12 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 12 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: May 2020 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-73830).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products    This vulnerability affects Cisco products that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software that is configured to support OSPF routing with LLS block processing enabled. Note: LLS block processing is enabled by default. Determine Whether OSPF Routing Is Configured on an ASA Device To determine whether OSPF routing is configured on an ASA device, administrators can use the **show ospf** privileged mode command. If no output is returned, OSPF routing is not configured. In the following example, the device is configured for OSPF routing:  ```   asa# show ospf      Routing Process “ospf 2” with ID 10.1.89.2 and Domain ID 0.0.0.2   Supports only single TOS(TOS0) routes   Supports opaque LSA   .   .   .   ``` Determine Whether OSPF Routing Is Configured on an FTD Device To determine whether OSPF routing is configured on an FTD device, administrators can do one of the following:    + For devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), choose **Devices > Device Management**, select the device of interest, and then choose  **Routing > OSPF**. If either **Process 1** or **Process 2** has a check mark, OSPF is enabled on the device.   + For devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), choose **Device**  **>** **Advanced Configuration > View Configuration** **>** **Smart CLI**  **>** **Routing**. If there is an object with the type of *OSPF*, then OSPF is enabled on the device. For information about which Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-asa-ospf-lsa-dos#fs) section of this advisory.    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
