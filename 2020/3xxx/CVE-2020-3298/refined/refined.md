Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3298:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper memory protection mechanisms within the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) implementation of Cisco ASA and FTD software. This occurs specifically when processing certain OSPF packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Memory Protection:** The core issue is that the software does not adequately protect memory while handling specific OSPF packets. This lack of protection allows an attacker to manipulate memory and cause a denial-of-service.
- **Malformed OSPF Packets:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing malformed OSPF packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause the affected device to reload, leading to a denial of service. This disrupts client traffic that relies on the device for routing and security.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
- **Network-Based:** The attack vector is network-based, where the attacker sends crafted OSPF packets over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected Cisco ASA or FTD device.
- No prior authentication or privileges are required.
- The attacker needs the capability to craft malformed OSPF packets.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA and FTD software when OSPF routing with LLS block processing is enabled (which is the default).
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a series of malformed OSPF packets in a short period.
- There are no known workarounds, only software updates from Cisco.
- The vulnerability is identified with CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read).
- Cisco Bug ID for this vulnerability is CSCvs50459.
- The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS base score of 8.6 (High Severity).
