Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3449:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of lexicographical order when displaying additional path information within Cisco IOS XR Software. This incorrect calculation leads to an infinite loop when processing specific BGP update data using `show bgp` commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Lexicographical Order Calculation:** The core issue is a flaw in how the software handles and sorts additional path information during display. This is triggered by specific BGP updates.
- **Infinite Loop:** The flawed sorting logic results in an infinite loop within the `show bgp` command execution.
- **Denial of Service:** The infinite loop effectively halts the BGP process, preventing it from processing new updates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a DoS condition on the affected device's BGP process.
- **Inability to Monitor BGP Status:** Authorized users are unable to properly monitor the BGP status due to the `show bgp` command failing.
- **Outdated Routing Information:** The BGP process stops processing new updates which leads to outdated information in routing and forwarding tables.
- **No Immediate Data Plane Loss:** While the vulnerability does not immediately interrupt data forwarding, routing table inconsistencies will eventually disrupt data plane.
- **Error Message:** The device returns an error message similar to: `% Failed to retrieve data from EDM server: 'sysdb' detected the 'warning' condition 'An EDM took too long to process a request and was timed out'`

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote from the targeted device.
- **BGP Update Injection:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP update from a BGP neighbor peer session of the affected device.  The update needs to come from a BGP implementation not done by a Cisco network operating system.
- **`show bgp` Command Trigger:** The vulnerability is only triggered when an authorized user issues a `show bgp` command on the device which contains the malicious BGP update in its BGP table.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **BGP Peer:** The attacker needs to be a BGP neighbor peer of the vulnerable device.
- **Ability to Send BGP Updates:** The attacker must be able to send specially crafted BGP updates to the affected device.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires an authorized user to issue a `show bgp` command.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XR Software releases earlier than 7.1.2, 7.2.1, and 7.3.1.
- Devices must be configured to receive additional paths to be vulnerable.
- There are no workarounds other than restarting the BGP process to temporarily alleviate the effects. However, issuing the `show bgp` command after a restart will return the device to a vulnerable state.
- The provided CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L` which equates to a Base Score of 4.3 (Medium severity).
