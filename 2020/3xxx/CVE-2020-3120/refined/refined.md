    "summary": "The provided documents describe a vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) implementation for Cisco FXOS, IOS XR, and NX-OS software, identified as CVE-2020-3120. An adjacent attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by sending a malicious CDP packet which exhausts system memory leading to a device reload.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing check when the affected software processes Cisco Discovery Protocol messages.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Missing check when processing CDP messages."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Specifically, a malicious CDP packet can exhaust system memory, causing the affected device to reload.",
      "attack_vectors": "An unauthenticated attacker sends a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be in the same broadcast domain (Layer 2 adjacent) as the affected device since CDP is a Layer 2 protocol. No authentication is required."
