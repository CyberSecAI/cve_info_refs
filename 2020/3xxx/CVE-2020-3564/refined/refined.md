Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the FTP inspection engine of Cisco ASA and FTD software. It is caused by the "ineffective flow tracking of FTP traffic".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The FTP inspection engine fails to properly track FTP traffic flows. Specifically, it seems that the flow is not properly tracked and the state of the connection is not properly tracked.
*   **FTP Inspection Bypass:** Due to the ineffective flow tracking, an attacker can send crafted FTP traffic to bypass the intended security checks of the FTP inspection engine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **FTP Inspection Bypass:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass FTP inspection.
*   **Unrestricted FTP Connections:** By bypassing inspection, the attacker can establish FTP connections that might otherwise have been blocked. This can lead to unauthorized access or data transfer.
*   **Compromised Network Security:** The FTP traffic could then be used to carry malicious payloads or initiate further attacks on the internal network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Network-Based:** The attacker can be located remotely and doesn't require local access to the affected device, as they can send crafted FTP traffic over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker doesn't need to authenticate to the device to exploit this vulnerability, as the traffic passes through the firewall and is handled by the FTP inspection engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send network traffic to a device running vulnerable Cisco ASA or FTD software with strict FTP inspection enabled.
*   **Crafted FTP Traffic Generation:** The attacker needs the ability to craft specific FTP traffic designed to exploit the flaw in the flow tracking mechanism.

**Additional Information from the content:**

*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available to mitigate the vulnerability besides applying software updates.
*   **Specific Configuration Required:** The vulnerability is only present if strict FTP inspection is enabled on the affected devices.
*   **Fixed Software Versions:** The advisory lists the first fixed software releases for both Cisco ASA and FTD software.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.8 (Medium severity) and the vector is "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N".
*   **Updated Advisory**: The advisory was updated to address a new vulnerability impacting fixed release recommendations for code trains 9.13 and 9.14. This new vulnerability is related to SSL/TLS denial of service.
