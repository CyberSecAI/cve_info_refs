Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3799:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a **stack-based buffer overflow**.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:**  A buffer on the stack is overflowed, potentially overwriting other data on the stack, including return addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The specific attack vector is not detailed in the provided document, but it is implied that the vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted file (likely PDF) or through other manipulation of the application input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to supply a malicious PDF file or similar crafted input that triggers the stack-based buffer overflow. This could be achieved by:
    *   Emailing a malicious document to a user.
    *   Hosting a malicious PDF on a website and enticing a user to open it.
    *   Other methods of delivering malicious input to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of how to exploit a stack-based buffer overflow in the context of the target application (Acrobat/Reader).

**Additional Notes:**
* This vulnerability is rated as **Critical** by Adobe, meaning that it could have significant consequences if exploited by malicious actors.
* The bulletin provides information about other vulnerabilities that were patched in the same update, including other critical code execution vulnerabilities.
* The vulnerability was reported by Xu Peng and Su Purui from TCA/SKLCS Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wang Yanhao from QiAnXin Technology Research Institute.
