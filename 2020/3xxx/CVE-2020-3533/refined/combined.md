"title": "Summary",
"text": "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) input packet processor of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of sufficient memory management protections under heavy SNMP polling loads. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of SNMP requests to the SNMP daemon through the management interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP daemon process to consume a large amount of system memory over time, which could then lead to an unexpected device restart, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the October 2020 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 17 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 17 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: October 2020 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74302\"]."

"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco FTD Software and SNMP is configured on the device management interface.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n Determine Whether SNMP is Configured\r\nOption 1: Use the CLI\r\n\r\nOn devices that are running Cisco FTD Software, use the show running-config snmp CLI command. It is available from Diagnostic CLI mode [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/command\_ref/b\_Command\_Reference\_for\_Firepower\_Threat\_Defense/using\_the\_FTD\_CLI.html#wp3783114587\"] only. To enter Diagnostic CLI mode, use the system support diagnostic-cli command in the regular Cisco FTD CLI. If the snmp-server host management address is configured, the device is considered vulnerable, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nftd# show running-config snmp\r\nsnmp-server enable\r\nsnmp-server host management 192.168.1.5 [\"http://192.168.1.5/\"]\r\n\r\nOption 2: Use the Firepower Management Center GUI\r\n\r\nOn devices that are running Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software, choose Devices > Platform Settings > Enable SNMP Servers. If the interface of an SNMP server in the hosts tab is configured for the Cisco FTD management interface, then the device is considered vulnerable."

"title": "Fixed Software",
"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The center column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by any of the vulnerabilities described in this bundle and which release includes fixes for those vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nCisco FTD Software\r\n Cisco FTD Software Release First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability First Fixed Release for All Vulnerabilities Described in the Bundle of Advisories Earlier than 6.2.21 Not vulnerable. Migrate to a fixed release. 6.2.2 Not vulnerable. Migrate to a fixed release. 6.2.3 Not vulnerable. Migrate to a fixed release. 6.3.0 Not vulnerable. Migrate to a fixed release. 6.4.0 Not vulnerable. Migrate to a fixed release. 6.5.0 Not vulnerable. Migrate to a fixed release. 6.6.0 6.6.1 6.6.1\r\n1. Cisco FMC and FTD Software releases 6.0.1 and earlier, as well as releases 6.2.0 and 6.2.1, have reached end of software maintenance. Customers are advised to migrate to a supported release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo upgrade to a fixed release of Cisco FTD Software, do one of the following:\r\n\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), use the FMC interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy.\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), use the FDM interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy."

| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.

The vulnerability is due to a lack of sufficient memory management protections under heavy SNMP polling loads. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of SNMP requests to the SNMP daemon through the management interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP daemon process to consume a large amount of system memory over time, which could then lead to an unexpected device restart, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.  This vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-snmp-dos-R8ENPbOs>  This advisory is part of the October 2020 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 17 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 17 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: October 2020 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74302).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco FTD Software and SNMP is configured on the device management interface.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Whether SNMP is Configured **Option 1: Use the CLI**  On devices that are running Cisco FTD Software, use the **show running-config** **snmp** CLI command. It is available from [Diagnostic CLI mode](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/command_ref/b_Command_Reference_for_Firepower_Threat_Defense/using_the_FTD_CLI.html#wp3783114587) only. To enter Diagnostic CLI mode, use the **system support diagnostic-cli** command in the regular Cisco FTD CLI. If the **snmp-server host management** address is configured, the device is considered vulnerable, as shown in the following example:  ```   ftd# show running-config snmpsnmp-server enablesnmp-server host management [192.168.1.5](http://192.168.1.5/)   ```  **Option 2: Use the Firepower Management Center GUI**  On devices that are running Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software, choose **Devices > Platform Settings > Enable SNMP Servers**. If the interface of an SNMP server in the hosts tab is configured for the Cisco FTD management interface, then the device is considered vulnerable. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software or Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.  Workarounds  * There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.  Administrators can disable SNMP polling to the management interface of the Cisco FTD device.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
