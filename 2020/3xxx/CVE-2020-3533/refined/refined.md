Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3533

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of sufficient memory management protections within the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) input packet processor of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software under heavy SNMP polling loads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient memory management when handling high rates of SNMP requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause the SNMP daemon process to consume a large amount of system memory over time.
- This excessive memory consumption can lead to an unexpected device restart.
- The unexpected device restart results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a high rate of SNMP requests to the SNMP daemon through the management interface of an affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the management interface of the vulnerable Cisco FTD device.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP on vulnerable Cisco FTD Software.
*   The vulnerability does *not* affect Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software or Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.
*   A workaround is available by disabling SNMP polling to the management interface of the Cisco FTD device.
*   The issue is resolved in FTD software version 6.6.1 and later.
*   CVSS v3.1 score is 8.6 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
