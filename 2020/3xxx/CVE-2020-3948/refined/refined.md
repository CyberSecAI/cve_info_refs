- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper file permissions in Cortado Thinprint within Linux guest VMs running on VMware Workstation and Fusion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Local privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local attackers with non-administrative access to a Linux guest VM with virtual printing enabled may exploit this issue to elevate their privileges to root on the same guest VM.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to a Linux guest VM.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have non-administrative access to a Linux guest VM where virtual printing is enabled.

The vulnerability is only exploitable when virtual printing is enabled in the guest VM, which is not the default configuration for Workstation and Fusion.
