Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis of CVE-2020-3158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a system account within the High Availability (HA) service of Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem that has a default, static password. This password is not controlled by the system administrator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-798:** Use of Hard-coded Credentials. The system uses a hardcoded, static password for a system account, instead of a randomly generated or user-configured password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by using the default credentials to connect to the affected system.
- Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain both *read* and *write* access to system data, which includes the configuration of the affected device.
- The attacker would gain access to a sensitive portion of the system, but not full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network (AV:N):** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** Exploitation is relatively straightforward.
- **No Privileges Required (PR:N):** No prior authentication or privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction Required (UI:N):** No user interaction is necessary for successful exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem instance over the network.
- The attacker needs to know the default, static username and password for the vulnerable account, which is presumed to be consistent across installations.

**Additional Notes:**
- The High Availability (HA) feature must be enabled for the system to be vulnerable. This feature is not enabled by default.
- Cisco Smart Software Manager satellite and Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem are the same product, with the name changing as of Release 7.0.
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
- The fix is available in Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem releases 7-202001 and later.
