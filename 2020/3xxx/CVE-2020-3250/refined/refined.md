Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-3250:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient access control validation within the REST API of Cisco UCS Director and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data. Specifically, the vulnerability exists within the processing of the `userAPIDownloadFile` API which calls the `downloadFile` method. The issue arises from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied paths prior to file operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authentication bypass.
- Directory traversal.
- Insufficient input validation.
- Improper access control.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass authentication and execute API calls.
- Potential Denial of Service (DoS) condition on the affected device.
- An attacker can disclose sensitive information by reading arbitrary files on the system.
- Allows an attacker to interact with the REST API.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted request to the REST API, specifically the `userAPIDownloadFile` API.
- Sending a request to a REST API endpoint.
- Leveraging a user-supplied path in file operations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability to disclose information, though some impacts such as DoS and API interaction do not need authentication either, depending on the specific endpoint.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco UCS Director and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data.
- The issue allows the disclosure of file contents in the context of root.
- Proof-of-concept exploit code is available.
- Fixed releases are available in Cisco UCS Director Release 6.7.4.0 and UCS Director Express for Big Data Release 3.7.4.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by Steven Seeley (mr_me) of Source Incite working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
