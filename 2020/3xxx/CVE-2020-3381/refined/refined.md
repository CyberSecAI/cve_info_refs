Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3381:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of files uploaded to the Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software through its web management interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw, which allows an attacker to access files outside the intended directory.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The software fails to adequately validate uploaded files, enabling the exploitation of the directory traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Read Access:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the targeted system.
- **Write Access:** Attackers can modify arbitrary files on the targeted system.
- **Potential Full System Compromise:** Through arbitrary file modification, it's plausible that a malicious actor could gain further access to the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Web Management Interface:** The attack occurs through the web management interface of the Cisco SD-WAN vManage software.
- **File Upload:** The vulnerability is triggered by uploading a crafted file to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software. This indicates the attacker requires valid credentials for access.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the affected system to access the web management interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory)
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8, with the vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating high severity.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than upgrading to the fixed software release.
- The advisory is part of a collection that also includes advisories for denial of service, static credential, and remote code execution vulnerabilities.
- The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
