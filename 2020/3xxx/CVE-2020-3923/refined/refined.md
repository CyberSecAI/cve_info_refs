Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-3923:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The firmware uses a symmetric algorithm (3DES) with fixed keys for authentication of a service on TCP port 9530. This service is intended for engineers to maintain the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The authentication mechanism is weak due to the use of a symmetric algorithm with fixed keys, making it susceptible to reverse engineering.
- **Hardcoded Credentials:** The fixed keys effectively act as hardcoded credentials within the firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who can reverse engineer the firmware can retrieve the fixed keys and gain root access to the device.
- With root access, the attacker can potentially infect the device, turning it into a botnet and use it to launch DDoS attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Firmware Analysis:** Attackers need to analyze the firmware to extract the fixed keys.
- **Network Access:** The vulnerable service is accessible on TCP port 9530.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Reverse Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs the skills to reverse engineer the firmware and understand the authentication process.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable device.
