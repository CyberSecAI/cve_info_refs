Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists due to the mishandling of crafted Security Group Tag Exchange Protocol (SXP) packets. Specifically, the software fails to properly process these specially constructed packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The core weakness is in the way the affected Cisco software processes SXP packets, which allows specially crafted packets to trigger a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause the affected device to reload, leading to a denial of service condition. This means the device becomes unavailable for its intended purpose.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending crafted SXP packets over the network to a vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the affected device.
*   **SXP Password (Potentially):** If an SXP password is configured on the peers, the attacker needs to know this password to successfully exploit the vulnerability.
*   **IP Address Spoofing**: The attacker must be able to source traffic from the configured peer IP address.
*   **Targeted IP Address:** The attacker must be able to target the traffic at the SXP listening IP address of the vulnerable device.
*    **TCP Handshake Completion:** The attacker must complete a TCP three-way handshake.
*   **SXP Mode:** The target device must be configured with SXP peers in `listener` or `both` mode to be vulnerable. Devices configured in `speaker` mode are not affected.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products**: Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, and specific Cisco NX-OS Software (Nexus 7000 Series Switches - Release 8.0(1) only, Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere, and Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere) are affected when SXP peer connections are configured in listener or both mode.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   **Fix**: Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
*   **Reporting Source:** FSTEC is credited with reporting the vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.8 (Medium severity).
