- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect handling of data returned for Cisco Discovery Protocol queries to SNMP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies within the SNMP implementation of the Cisco ASR 920 Series Aggregation Services Router model ASR920-12SZ-IM, specifically related to how it processes Cisco Discovery Protocol information obtained via SNMP.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A successful exploit can cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, achieved by sending a request for Cisco Discovery Protocol information using SNMP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be authenticated and remote. The attacker also needs to know how to request Cisco Discovery Protocol information by using SNMP.
