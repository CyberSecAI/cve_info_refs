Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3409

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient processing logic within the PROFINET feature of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software when handling crafted PROFINET packets. Specifically, the unauthenticated Real-Time Communication (RTC) profile of the Cisco PROFINET implementation allows an unauthenticated user to reset the device based on the PROFINET protocol standards.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of crafted PROFINET packets.
- Lack of proper input validation for PROFINET packets.
- Usage of an unauthenticated Real-Time Communication (RTC) profile that allows device resets.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected device. An attacker can send crafted PROFINET packets, causing the device to crash and reload.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by an adjacent attacker.
- The attacker sends specially crafted PROFINET packets to the targeted device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be in a network adjacent to the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The PROFINET feature is enabled by default on platforms that support it.
- The vulnerability affects various Cisco Industrial Ethernet devices.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability, besides disabling the PROFINET feature using the `no profinet` configuration command.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is tracked by two Cisco bug IDs: CSCvr83393 (for Cisco IOS) and CSCvs48147 (for Cisco IOS XE).
