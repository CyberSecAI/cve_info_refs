- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly validate 802.11w disassociation and deauthentication PMFs (Protected Management Frames) that it receives.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper validation of 802.11w disassociation and deauthentication PMFs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to terminate a single valid user connection to the affected device, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a spoofed 802.11w PMF from a valid, authenticated client on a network adjacent to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be adjacent to the affected device and have a valid, authenticated client on the same network in order to send spoofed 802.11w PMFs. The attacker does not need any prior authentication to the targeted device itself.
