Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3114

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protections within the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Lack of adequate CSRF protection mechanisms in the DCNM's web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can perform arbitrary actions on the affected system with the privilege level of the targeted user. This includes potential unauthorized configuration changes, data manipulation, or denial of service, depending on the user's permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Network-based Attack:** The attacker does not need to have local or adjacent access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attack relies on persuading a legitimate user to click a malicious link, while the user has an active session on the vulnerable DCNM instance. This could be through various means like phishing emails or malicious websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated, Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the DCNM application to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious link or website that a legitimate user will click.

**Summary:** This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to perform actions within the Cisco DCNM application by tricking a logged-in user into unknowingly sending malicious requests. The lack of CSRF protection means the application cannot differentiate between a legitimate request and a malicious one sent by the attacker.
