Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3128:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of certain elements within Webex recordings stored in either the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or the Webex Recording Format (WRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Insufficient input validation in the processing of ARF and WRF files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, modification, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a malicious ARF or WRF file to a user via a link or email attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious ARF or WRF file.
*   The attacker needs to persuade the victim to open the malicious file on their local system.
*   The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning that the attacker must have local access to the target machine in order to deliver the malicious file, or the user must download and open the malicious file locally.
*   No privileges are required (PR:N), indicating that the attacker does not need to have any prior access to the system.
*   User interaction is required (UI:R), because the user must open the malicious file.
