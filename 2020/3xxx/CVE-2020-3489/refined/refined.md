{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient validation of CAPWAP packets.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol processing"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected device.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malformed CAPWAP packet to an affected device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Unauthenticated, adjacent attacker."
}
