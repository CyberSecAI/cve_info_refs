Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect processing of specific Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) packets within the BGP module of Cisco ASA and FTD software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of BGP packets leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit results in a DoS condition, rendering the affected device unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network connection.
- The attacker sends a crafted BGP packet to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability, making it exploitable by unauthenticated remote attackers.
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic (specifically crafted BGP packets) to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software.
- No workarounds are available; the only remediation is to upgrade to a fixed software release.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability
- The CVSS score is 6.8 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.
- No public announcements or known malicious use of this vulnerability have been reported.
