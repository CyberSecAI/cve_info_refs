Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the incorrect processing of Access Control Lists (ACLs) associated with the RESTCONF and NETCONF-YANG features in Cisco IOS XE Software. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when an IPv4 or IPv6 ACL has exactly 13 entries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of ACLs linked to RESTCONF/NETCONF-YANG features when they contain exactly 13 entries.
- The software fails to properly process these specific ACLs leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can cause the affected device to reload, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by accessing the device using RESTCONF or NETCONF-YANG interfaces.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the device's RESTCONF or NETCONF-YANG interfaces remotely.
- No specific privileges are needed. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered specifically when an ACL (IPv4 or IPv6) has exactly 13 entries, and is associated with the RESTCONF or NETCONF-YANG feature.
- A workaround is to modify the ACL so that it does not contain exactly 13 entries.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was found during a Cisco TAC support case.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereference).
- The CVSS score is 8.6, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.
