Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory handling error in the generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel decapsulation feature when processing GRE over IPv6 traffic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  A memory handling error occurs during the processing of GRE over IPv6 packets.
- The GRE tunnel decapsulation feature in the LINA engine of Cisco FTD Software is affected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by causing the affected device to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker sends crafted GRE over IPv6 packets with either IPv4 or IPv6 payload through an affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is required for the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco FTD Software releases 6.3.0 and 6.4.0.
- GRE tunnel decapsulation in the LINA engine was introduced in Cisco FTD Software Release 6.3.0 and is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.
- There are no workarounds that fully address the vulnerability, but a mitigation is available by bypassing decapsulation for GRE-tunneled flows.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 8.6 (High).
