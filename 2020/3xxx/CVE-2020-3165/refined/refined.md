Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in how Cisco NX-OS Software handles BGP MD5 authentication when the BGP peer does not have MD5 authentication configured, the NX-OS device does have BGP MD5 authentication configured, and the NX-OS BGP virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) name is configured to be greater than 19 characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of MD5 Authentication:** Under specific conditions, the BGP MD5 authentication mechanism is bypassed, allowing a BGP session to be established without proper authentication.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The system fails to properly validate the VRF name length, leading to the bypass.
- **Configuration dependency:** The vulnerability is triggered by a combination of specific configurations which includes the usage of MD5 authentication, a peer without MD5 authentication, and VRF name length greater than 19 characters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass MD5 authentication.
- An attacker could establish a BGP session with the vulnerable Cisco NX-OS device without proper MD5 authentication.
- Successfully establishing a BGP session would allow the attacker to manipulate routing information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to send malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer.
- This requires the attacker to obtain information about the BGP peers in the affected system's trusted network.
- The attack is remote, over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send TCP packets to the affected device and needs to appear as a trusted BGP peer.
- They would need some knowledge of the BGP configuration of the target network, specifically the peer information.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability affects Cisco NX-OS Software Releases 9.2(1), 9.2(2), 9.2(3), or 9.3(1) on Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode.
-   A workaround involves reconfiguring the VRF name to be 19 characters or less.
-   Cisco has released software updates to fix the vulnerability.
-   The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 8.2 (High).
-   The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
-   CWE-798 is mentioned, which usually refers to hardcoded credentials, this is not entirely accurate for this vulnerability.
