- **Root cause of vulnerability:** InstallBuilder for Qt Windows installers look for plugins at a predictable location at initialization time. This location is writable by non-admin users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** DLL planting vulnerability. The installer loads plugins from a user-writable location, allowing an attacker to place a malicious DLL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Code execution with the security scope of the installer. This could potentially lead to privilege escalation or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Requires local access to the machine to plant a malicious DLL in the predictable plugin directory. The attack occurs when a vulnerable installer is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the machine with the ability to write to the plugin directory before the installer is executed.
