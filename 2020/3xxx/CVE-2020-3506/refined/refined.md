Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3506:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing checks within the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) implementation of Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras when processing CDP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient validation of Cisco Discovery Protocol packets.
- Lack of proper input sanitization when processing CDP packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
  - Remote code execution (RCE) on the affected IP camera.
  - Unexpected reloading of the camera, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted, malicious CDP packet to a vulnerable IP camera.
- The attack is limited to the local broadcast domain (Layer 2 adjacent) as CDP is a Layer 2 protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be located within the same Layer 2 broadcast domain as the vulnerable Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP camera.
- No authentication is required for the attack.
- The attacker needs the ability to send raw Ethernet packets containing malicious CDP payloads.
