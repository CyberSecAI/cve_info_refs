Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3330

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability exists because a system account on the Cisco Small Business RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall has a default and static password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The device has a hardcoded, default password for a system account. This violates security best practices as it provides an easily guessable credential for a privileged account.
*   **Static Credentials:** The password does not change from the factory default, allowing attackers to use a known credential.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full Device Control:** A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain full control of the affected device with a high-privileged account.
*   **Complete Compromise:** The attacker can potentially perform any action on the device as a high privileged user.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The CVSS score indicates a high impact on all three aspects.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Network Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely via network access to the device's Telnet service.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability initially.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the deviceâ€™s Telnet service.
*   The attacker needs to know or have obtained the default credentials for the privileged account.
*  No special skills required, just the known credential

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall firmware releases earlier than Release 1.2.2.8.
* There are no workarounds available, requiring users to upgrade to the patched firmware.
* Cisco has released free software updates (firmware release 1.2.2.8 and later) to address the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS base score of 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
* Cisco thanks Larryxi of XDSEC for reporting this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is identified as CWE-798 which is "Use of Hard-coded Credentials".
