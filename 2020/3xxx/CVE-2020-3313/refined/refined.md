Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious script code into the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the user's browser session and in the context of the vulnerable web interface.
*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** The attacker could potentially access sensitive, browser-based information, such as session cookies or other data stored by the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attack can be performed remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   **Crafted Link:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by persuading a user of the FMC web interface to click a crafted link containing malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker must convince a user of the FMC web interface to click this crafted link, thus requiring social engineering or other methods of link distribution.
* The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the vulnerable FMC software.

**Affected Products:**
* Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) releases earlier than 6.2.2.3.

**Mitigation:**
* Upgrade to a fixed version of the Cisco FMC software. Versions 6.2.2.3 and later contain the fix for this vulnerability.
* There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
* There is no evidence of public announcements or malicious exploitation of this vulnerability.
* The provided information includes the CVSS score (6.5) with the vector string CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N.
