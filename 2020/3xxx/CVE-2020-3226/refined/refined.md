  "CVE-2020-3226": {
    "summary": "A vulnerability in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) library of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
    "details": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanity checks on received SIP messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service condition.",

          "Lack of input validation leading to potential denial-of-service."

      },
        "remediation": "Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n However, customers who do not use any SIP features but who have other voice-related features enabled, which automatically enables the SIP processes in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases prior to Release 16.11, can shut down the SIP ports by issuing the following commands in global configuration mode:\nRouter(config)#sip-ua\nRouter(config-sip-ua)#no transport udp Router(config-sip-ua)#no transport tcp Router(config-sip-ua)#no transport tcp tls\n\nAlternatively, customers can block traffic targeted to the designated SIP ports using infrastructure access control lists (iACLs). Using iACLs is a network security best practice and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network security as well as a mitigation for this specific issue. To help protect all devices with IP addresses in the infrastructure IP address range, customers are advised to include the following iACL example as part of the deployed iACL:\n\n!---\n!--- Feature: SIP !--- !--- Permit trusted SIP sources. !--- !--- Permit additional Layer 3 and Layer 4 traffic destined for infrastructure !--- address space as dictated by existing security policies and configurations. !--- Permit/deny to infrastructure IP addresses in accordance with security policy. !--- !--- Deny SIP traffic from all other sources destined !--- to infrastructure addresses !---\naccess-list 150 deny udp any INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES WILDCARD eq 5060 access-list 150 deny tcp any INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES WILDCARD eq 5060 access-list 150 deny tcp any INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES WILDCARD eq 5061\n!--- !--- Permit/deny all other Layer 3 and Layer 4 traffic in !--- accordance with existing security policies and !--- configurations. Permit all other traffic to transit the !--- device. !---\n\naccess-list 150 permit ip any any\n!--- !--- Apply access-list to all interfaces (only one example !--- shown) !---\ninterface GigabitEthernet 2/0 ip access-group 150 in"
