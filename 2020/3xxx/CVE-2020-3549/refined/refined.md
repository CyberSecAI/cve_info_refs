Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3549:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the insufficient protection of the `sftunnel` negotiation process during initial device registration between Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate sftunnel negotiation protection:** The initial negotiation phase of the `sftunnel` communication lacks sufficient security measures.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) vulnerability:** An attacker in a MitM position can intercept the `sftunnel` communication flow between an FMC and an FTD device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Device registration hash theft:**  A successful exploit allows the attacker to obtain the device registration hash.
*   **Decryption and modification of sftunnel communication:** The attacker can decrypt and modify the `sftunnel` communication between FMC and FTD devices.
*   **Data manipulation:** This allows the attacker to modify configuration data being sent from an FMC to an FTD device, and alert data sent from an FTD to an FMC.
*   **Potential for unauthorized changes and disruption:**  Modification of configuration data can lead to unauthorized changes in device behavior, while modifying alerts can mask malicious activity or trigger false alarms.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack:** An attacker must be positioned within the network to intercept communication between FMC and FTD devices.
*   **Remote:** The attacker does not need local access to the vulnerable devices; the attack is conducted remotely, over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network proximity:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the FMC and FTD devices.
*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to the FMC or FTD devices to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco FMC and FTD software. FTD devices are only affected if registered to an FMC.
*   The vulnerability affects all configurations because it impacts the inter-device communication channel.
*   There are no known workarounds to address the vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to fix this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered through internal security testing.
*   Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability is part of a bundled publication of multiple Cisco security advisories.
*   The CVSS base score is 8.1, indicating a high severity.
