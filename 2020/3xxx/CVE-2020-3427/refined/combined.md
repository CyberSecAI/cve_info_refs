# Duo Authentication for Windows Logon and RDP - Release Notes

Last Updated: November 27th, 2024

#### Contents

* [Windows Logon Instructions](/docs/rdp)

Duo integrates with Microsoft Windows client and server operating systems to add two-factor authentication to Remote Desktop and local logons.

Download the current release from the [Checksums and Downloads page](/docs/checksums#duo-windows-logon).

## Version 4.3.16 - November 14, 2024

This is a public preview release. Please install the 4.3.1 stable release if you do not wish to test the preview features.

* [Public preview of Passwordless OS Logon](/docs/rdp#passwordless-for-operating-system-(os)-logon). Instead of entering their Windows password, users log in securely via Bluetooth connection to a mobile device with Duo Mobile platform biometric or PIN verification.
* Adds certificate pinning to enhance security of the connection between the Duo for Windows Logon client and Duo's cloud service.
* Now sends the [Passport](/docs/passport) signature for every local authentication regardless of whether local remembered devices is enabled or checked. This removes the "Remember devices for Windows Logon" policy requirement for Duo Passport starting with the D304 cloud release.

## Version 4.3.1 - April 9, 2024

Modifications made to the Duo Authentication for Windows Logon version 4.3.1 installer result in direct upgrades from version 4.3.0 to version 4.3.1 leaving the program information for 4.3.0 visible in Add/Remove Programs and the registry. This does not affect the installed 4.3.1 application's operation. See the [Duo for Windows Logon FAQ](/docs/rdp-faq#why-do-i-see-both-version-4.3.0-and-4.3.1-installed-on-my-computer-after-attempting-an-upgrade?) for more information.

* Restores the ability to perform a silent install without providing application information in the command.
* Corrects an issue where the `exe` installer did not retain the existing `FailOpen` value during upgrade from a prior version.
* Corrects installer issues with uninstalls and reinstalls of the same version.
* Corrects an issue where a trusted session was erroneously invalidated.
* Corrects an issue where the login button was focused on by default instead of the passcode field.
* Adds the `MaxBootTimeDelta` GPO setting.

## Version 4.3.0 - February 27, 2024

* Accessibility improvements.
* Design improvements and minor bug fixes in installer.
* Corrects an issue which caused occasional black or frozen screens during Duo login.
* Adds an optional registry setting `ParseUsernameAndDomain` which overrides Duo user/domain determination logic by parsing the username provided by the user. Refer to [Why might an incorrect username get sent to Duo from a machine joined to Entra ID?](/docs/rdp-faq#why-might-an-incorrect-username-get-sent-to-duo-from-a-machine-joined-to-entra-id?) for more information.
* Addresses a security vulnerability in which trusted sessions persisted after a reboot ([CVE-2024-20301](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-20301); [Cisco Security Advisory](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-duo-win-bypass-pn42KKBm)).
* Addresses a security vulnerability where the Duo secret key value was logged in plain-text during an application upgrade ([CVE-2024-20292](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-20292); [Cisco Security Advisory](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-duo-infodisc-rLCEqm6T)).
  + We recommend you migrate to a new instance of the application to preserve the integrity of the application credentials on your client systems. Refer to [Duo KB Article 8760](https://help.duo.com/s/article/8760) for step-by-step instructions. Refer to the Duo KB article [What are Duo application credentials and how should I protect them?](https://help.duo.com/s/article/application-credentials) for more information.
* Corrects an issue where the installer did not secure the Duo registry key so integration credentials could be read by unprivileged users until the registry key was secured by first launch of the application.
* The `exe` installer now defaults to "fail closed" for the **Bypass Duo authentication when offline (FailOpen)** setting and overrides the previous fail mode selection. The `msi` now installer will default to "fail closed" for net new installations and upgrades will preserve the previous fail mode selection.

## Version 4.2.2 - March 15, 2023

* Corrects an issue in Duo Offline Access for Windows which allowed "Windows Offline" login passcodes to be reused or replayed under certain conditions ([CVE-2023-20123](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20123); [Cisco Security Advisory](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-duo-replay-knuNKd)).

## Version 4.2.1 - November 22, 2022

* Corrects an issue where an enrolled Windows Offline user would be deprovisioned from offline access if there was a network disruption during online login.

## Version 4.2.0 - September 23, 2021

* Introduces [remembered devices](/docs/rdp#remembered-devices-for-windows-logon) for local Windows logins. The [Remembered Devices policy](/docs/policy#remembered-devices) for Duo Essentials, Advantage, and Premier plan customers now includes settings for Windows Logon. Remembering the device during online authentication creates a trusted session, letting users skip Duo two-factor authentication for the lifetime of the session.
* Adds the hostname of the system where Duo for Windows Logon is installed to Duo Mobile push requests and the Windows logon authentication type (Local, RDP, UAC) to Duo Push request notifications.
* Adds support for Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022.
* Bug fixes.

## Version 4.1.3 - November 2, 2020

* Fixes an issue with Duo Windows Logon installer that may cause a MSI self-repair and subsequent "Installation stopped" error from Duo Windows Logon Installer. Customers upgrading from 4.1.2 may still experience unexpected MSI self repairs during installation. Refer to [Duo KB article 6462](https://help.duo.com/s/article/6462) for additional remediation steps.

## Version 4.1.2 - October 14, 2020

* Addresses an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows Logon installer which could allow an authenticated local attacker to overwrite files in privileged directories ([CVE-2020-3427](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3427)). The vulnerability was limited to the installer only, and did not affect the application once installed.

## Version 4.1.1 - July 13, 2020

* Updated installer to remove the password check that contributed to user lockouts in v4.1.0 when installed on Active Directory Domain Controllers. Customers with v4.1.0 installed should upgrade to v4.1.1 at the earliest opportunity.

## Version 4.1.0 - April 29, 2020

There is a known issue with installation of Duo Authentication for Windows Logon and RDP version 4.1 on Active Directory domain controllers that may trigger user lockouts.

* Introduces User Elevation, which adds the 2FA Duo prompt for credentialed User Account Control.
* GPO template updated to include User Elevation configuration.
* SHA-256 signed installer.
* Additional bug fixes and security enhancements

## Version 4.0.7 - October 2019

* Fixes an issue related to multiple in-flight authentications.
* Support for Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 ends in January 2020. Future releases may not function on unsupported operating systems.

## Version 4.0.6 - September 2019

* Added a [support tool](/docs/rdp-faq#using-the-support-tool) that sanitizes and packages config and log files into a zip file you can send to Duo Support when troubleshooting issues.
* Added [log file rotation](/docs/rdp-faq#how-can-i-configure-log-file-rotation?).
* Added additional UI installer options for HTTP proxy settings.
* Updated GPO template to include log file rotation and Offline Authentication configuration.
* Removed .NET dependency for the installer connectivity check.
* Fixed a bug that would result in "Ordinal Not Found" being displayed in certain scenarios.
* Fixed the flow of windows password changes that could cause re-enrollment in Offline Authentication.
* Removed errant log message stating "Duo Auth Not Configured".
* Response to [CERT/CC Vulnerability Note VU#576688](https://help.duo.com/s/article/5148?language=en_US).
* Security improvements for Offline Authentication.
* Additional bug fixes and security enhancements.

## Version 4.0.5 - April 2019

* Correct issue enforcing secure failmode (`FailOpen=0`) when the Offline Access feature is disabled at the client system (`OfflineAvailable=0`). [PSA-2019-001 (CVE-2019-11237)](/labs/psa/duo-psa-2019-001)

## Version 4.0.3 - February 2019

* Corrected issue with installer not preserving configured options on upgrade.

## Version 4.0.2 - February 2019

* Corrected an issue with offline access de-provisioning registered users unexpectedly after a bypass login.
* Installer dialog changes for integration and smart card options.
* Command line installer now permits setting all configuration options.
* Fixed issues with installer product codes that affected MSI in-place upgrades.

## Version 4.0.1 - December 2018

## Version 4.0.0 - November 2018

* Introduces [offline access with Duo MFA](/docs/rdp#offline-access).
