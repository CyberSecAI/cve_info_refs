**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insufficient input validation during web server authentication in Cisco IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper input validation during authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to crash the web server on the device. The web server needs to be manually recovered by disabling and re-enabling it. General traffic through the device is unaffected, only the web server functionality is impacted.

**Attack vectors:**
Remote attacker exploiting the web server's authentication mechanism.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be authenticated to the web server.
The attacker must send unexpected characters during authentication.

**Affected Products:**

**Mitigation:**
There are no workarounds. Disabling the HTTP server via the commands `no ip http server` or `no ip http secure-server` is a suitable mitigation until the devices are upgraded.
