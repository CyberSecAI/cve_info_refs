Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3393:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by two main factors:
1.  **Incomplete input validation:** The Cisco IOS XE Software fails to properly validate user-supplied input within CLI commands in the application-hosting subsystem.
2.  **Improper role-based access control (RBAC):** There are flaws in the RBAC implementation when commands are issued at the command line within the application-hosting subsystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application-hosting subsystem's command-line interface doesn't adequately sanitize user input, leading to potential injection of malicious commands.
*   **Improper RBAC:** The system's role-based access controls are not properly enforced, allowing a lower-privileged user to execute commands with elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows a local, authenticated attacker to:
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Escalate privileges to root on the affected device.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Execute arbitrary IOS XE commands outside the Docker container of the application-hosting subsystem and on the underlying Linux OS, all with root privileges.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Potentially gain full control of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the affected device.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** The vulnerability is exploited through crafting malicious CLI commands within the application-hosting subsystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid user credentials to log in to the affected device and access the application-hosting subsystem CLI.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to execute commands locally on the device.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco IOS XE Software releases 16.12.1 and later with the Application Hosting feature enabled and a hosted application running are vulnerable.
*   **Workarounds:** No workarounds address the vulnerability. Mitigation can be achieved by disabling the Application Hosting feature or removing hosted application configurations if they are not needed.
*  **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.0, categorized as Medium severity, with the vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`.
*   **Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing by Victor Kamensky of Cisco.
