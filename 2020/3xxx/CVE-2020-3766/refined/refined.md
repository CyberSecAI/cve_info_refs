  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect permission assignment on a resource used by the service allows for privilege escalation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate privileges and execute code with SYSTEM level privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access is required. An attacker must first have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the capability to execute low-privileged code on the target system."
