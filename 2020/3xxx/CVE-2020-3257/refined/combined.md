| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.1 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.1 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.1 |

"text": "Two vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application environment of Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices that are running Cisco IOS Software could allow an attacker to cause a DoS condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities reside in either the ingress packet processing functionality or the implementation of the inter-VM communication channel of Cisco IOS Software for the affected products.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability.\r\n Vulnerability Details\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n\r\nCisco IOx Application Environment for IOS Software for Cisco Industrial Routers Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the implementation of the inter-VM communication channel of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system with high privileges.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain type, length, value (TLV) fields of signaling packets that are exchanged between Cisco IOS Software and Guest OS. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device by using low-privileged-user credentials and then sending crafted signaling packets while establishing a TCP session destined to the process that manages the inter-VM communication of an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Cisco IOS Software VM running on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by using malicious TCP packets over either IPv4 or IPv6.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvr15042 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr15042\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2020-3257\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nMitigation for CVE-2020-3257\r\n\r\nCustomers who do not use Guest OS can disable the virtual interface that is managed by Cisco IOS Software. This interface provides connectivity between the Cisco IOS Software VM and Guest OS. Configuring the virtual interface in shutdown mode eliminates the attack vector for this vulnerability and may be a suitable mitigation until affected devices can be upgraded. Applying this mitigation will prevent further access to Guest OS.\r\n\r\nThe following table identifies the virtual interface for each affected Cisco product:\r\n Cisco Product Virtual Interface 809 Industrial ISRs Gigabit Ethernet 2 829 Industrial ISRs Gigabit Ethernet 5 CGR1000 Gigabit Ethernet 0/1\r\nAdministrators can configure the interface in shutdown mode by entering the shutdown command in interface configuration mode. The following example shows the output of the show run interface gigabitEthernet  command for a device that has an interface in shutdown mode:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show run interface gigabitEthernet  | i shutdown\r\n Shutdown\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco IOx Application Environment for IOS Software for Cisco Industrial Routers Guest OS Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the ingress packet processing functionality of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to shut down, reload, or uninstall the Guest OS instance running on an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient isolation of an internal, emulated Ethernet interface that should not process traffic from outside the device when the traffic is destined for the 127.0.0.0/8 range. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious IP packets. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to shut down, reload, or uninstall the Guest OS instance running on an affected device.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvq68872 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvq68872\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2020-3199\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 8.1\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nDetermine Whether Guest OS Is Enabled\r\n\r\nAdministrators can determine whether Guest OS is enabled on a device by using the show iox host list detail | include OS status command in the device CLI.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that has Guest OS enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show iox host list detail | include OS status\r\nOS status: \t\tRUNNING\r\n\r\nIf this command does not exist, or if it produces output that does not show the string RUNNING in the OS status field, the device is not affected by this vulnerability."

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n Cisco IOS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco IOS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS Software release—for example, 15.1(4)M2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search."

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-iot-gos-vuln-s9qS8kYL>  This advisory is part of the June 3, 2020, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 23 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 25 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: June 2020 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-73388).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software:    + Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial ISRs   + CGR1000 For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Note:** Cisco Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices are designed on a hypervisor architecture, where Cisco IOS Software and a Guest OS, such as a Linux operating system, run as two separate virtual machines (VMs). Cisco IOS Software and Guest OS perform inter-VM signaling and control operations by establishing a TCP-based channel.  Guest OS is available as part of a Cisco IOS Software image bundle that contains the hypervisor, Cisco IOS Software, and Guest OS images. Customers who used a Cisco IOS Software image bundle for performing either an initial installation or a software upgrade will have Guest OS automatically installed as part of the software image bundle installation. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco products:    + 800 Series ISRs   + 807 Industrial ISRs   + IOS XE Software   + IOS XR Software   + NX-OS Software  Details  * Two vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application environment of Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices that are running Cisco IOS Software could allow an attacker to cause a DoS condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on an affected device.  These vulnerabilities reside in either the ingress packet processing functionality or the implementation of the inter-VM communication channel of Cisco IOS Software for the affected products.  The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. Vulnerability Details Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.  **Cisco IOx Application Environment for IOS Software for Cisco Industrial Routers Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the implementation of the inter-VM communication channel of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system with high privileges.  The vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain type, length, value (TLV) fields of signaling packets that are exchanged between Cisco IOS Software and Guest OS. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device by using low-privileged-user credentials and then sending crafted signaling packets while establishing a TCP session destined to the process that manages the inter-VM communication of an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Cisco IOS Software VM running on an affected device.  This vulnerability can be exploited by using malicious TCP packets over either IPv4 or IPv6.  Bug ID(s): [CSCvr15042](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr15042)CVE ID: CVE-2020-3257Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 7.8CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  *Mitigation for CVE-2020-3257*  Customers who do not use Guest OS can disable the virtual interface that is managed by Cisco IOS Software. This interface provides connectivity between the Cisco IOS Software VM and Guest OS. Configuring the virtual interface in shutdown mode eliminates the attack vector for this vulnerability and may be a suitable mitigation until affected devices can be upgraded. Applying this mitigation will prevent further access to Guest OS.  The following table identifies the virtual interface for each affected Cisco product:       | Cisco Product | Virtual Interface |   | --- | --- |   | 809 Industrial ISRs | Gigabit Ethernet 2 |   | 829 Industrial ISRs | Gigabit Ethernet 5 |   | CGR1000 | Gigabit Ethernet 0/1 |       Administrators can configure the interface in shutdown mode by entering the **shutdown** command in interface configuration mode. The following example shows the output of the **show run interface** *gigabitEthernet*  <*id*> command for a device that has an interface in shutdown mode:  ```   Router#show run interface gigabitEthernet  | i shutdown     Shutdown   ```    **Cisco IOx Application Environment for IOS Software for Cisco Industrial Routers Guest OS Denial of Service Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the ingress packet processing functionality of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to shut down, reload, or uninstall the Guest OS instance running on an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient isolation of an internal, emulated Ethernet interface that should not process traffic from outside the device when the traffic is destined for the 127.0.0.0/8 range. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious IP packets. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to shut down, reload, or uninstall the Guest OS instance running on an affected device.  Bug ID(s): [CSCvq68872](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvq68872)CVE ID: CVE-2020-3199Security Impact Rating (SIR): HighCVSS Base Score: 8.1CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H  *Determine Whether Guest OS Is Enabled*  Administrators can determine whether Guest OS is enabled on a device by using the **show iox host list detail | include OS status** command in the device CLI.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that has Guest OS enabled:  ```   Router#show iox host list detail | include OS statusOS status: 		RUNNING   ```  If this command does not exist, or if it produces output that does not show the string **RUNNING** in the **OS status** field, the device is not affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  Cisco IOS Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco IOS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.  Customers can use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2**:       By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search.
