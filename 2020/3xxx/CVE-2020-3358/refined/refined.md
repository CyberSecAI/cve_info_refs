Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3358

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation of HTTP requests within the SSL VPN feature of Cisco Small Business RV VPN Routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The system fails to adequately validate incoming HTTP requests over SSL connections. This allows for the injection of malicious or malformed data that the system is unable to process correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A successful exploit leads to the targeted device unexpectedly restarting. This causes a DoS condition, disrupting network services and impacting availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Network Attack: Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network by sending specially crafted HTTP requests.
- SSL Connection Required: The crafted requests must be sent over an SSL connection to the targeted device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated Access: The attacker does not need to authenticate to the device to trigger the vulnerability.
- Network Connectivity: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device to send the malicious HTTP request over the SSL connection.

**Additional Information:**
- Affected Products: The vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if SSL VPN is configured:
    - RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router
    - RV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Router
    - RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router
    - RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit POE VPN Router
- Fixed Software: Cisco has released firmware version 1.0.03.18 to address this issue.
- Workaround: Disabling the SSL VPN configuration eliminates the attack vector.
- CVSS Score: The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.6, with a vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.
