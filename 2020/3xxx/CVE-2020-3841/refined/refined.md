The provided content contains information about CVE-2020-3841.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an issue in how Safari Login AutoFill handles the user interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The core vulnerability lies in the UI handling within Safari Login AutoFill, which allows a local user to send a password unencrypted over the network. The issue is described as related to the UI rather than a memory corruption or similar.

**Impact of exploitation:** A local user can unknowingly transmit their password in an unencrypted form over the network. This exposure could potentially lead to the compromise of the user's credentials if an attacker is able to intercept the network traffic.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a local user using Safari Login AutoFill. The vulnerability doesn't involve remote code execution or other complex attacks but rather relies on a user interaction that inadvertently exposes their password over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic from the vulnerable device. The attacker also needs knowledge on how to use the specific exploit condition within Safari Login AutoFill to send the password over the network.
