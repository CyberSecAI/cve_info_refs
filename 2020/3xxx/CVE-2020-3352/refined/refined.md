Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3352:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the presence of undocumented configuration commands within the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software's CLI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Undocumented Configuration Commands:** The core issue is the existence of hidden or undocumented commands that were not intended for general CLI access. These commands can be accessed if an attacker takes specific steps to expose them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** A successful exploit allows a local, authenticated attacker to make configuration changes to various sections of the affected device. These configuration changes would typically not be available via the standard CLI.
*   **Compromised Device Security:** This unauthorized access could compromise the security posture of the FTD device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the affected device.
*   **CLI Exploitation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability through the CLI.
*   **Specific steps:** Specific steps are required to make the hidden commands accessible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with local access to the FTD device's CLI.

**Additional Notes**
*  The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
*  There are no workarounds.

In summary, CVE-2020-3352 allows a local, authenticated attacker to gain access to undocumented commands in the Cisco FTD software CLI, potentially leading to unauthorized configuration changes and a compromise of the device's security.
