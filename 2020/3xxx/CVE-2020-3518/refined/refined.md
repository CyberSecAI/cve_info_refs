Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3518:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) Software does not properly validate user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is a lack of proper input validation in the web-based management interface, which leads to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This is categorized as CWE-79.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows an attacker to:
*   Execute arbitrary script code within the context of the affected web interface.
*   Access sensitive, browser-based information of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote and does not need local access to the server.
*   **User Interaction:**  The attacker must persuade a user to click a specially crafted link to trigger the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Cisco DCNM interface.
*   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker must be able to convince a legitimate user to click the malicious link.

**Summary of CVE-2020-3518:**

CVE-2020-3518 is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco DCNM Software. It occurs due to improper input validation, allowing an authenticated remote attacker to inject malicious scripts by tricking a user into clicking a crafted link. This could lead to the attacker executing arbitrary code within the userâ€™s browser session or gaining access to sensitive information. The vulnerability affects DCNM software releases earlier than 11.4(1), and Cisco has provided a software fix in later versions.
