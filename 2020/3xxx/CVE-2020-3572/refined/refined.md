Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3572:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the SSL/TLS session handler of Cisco ASA and FTD software. This occurs when closing SSL/TLS connections under specific conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The core issue is the memory leak within the SSL/TLS session handler. This allows an attacker to consume device memory resources by triggering the leak repeatedly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to memory exhaustion on the affected device.
- **Prevention of New Connections:** Once memory is exhausted, the device will be unable to process new SSL/TLS connections.
- **Manual Intervention Required:** Recovery requires manual intervention to restore normal device functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **Unauthenticated:** No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish network connections to the vulnerable device.
- **Ability to Establish SSL/TLS Sessions:** The attacker needs the capability to initiate and close multiple SSL/TLS sessions and control their closure conditions.
