Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3347:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the unsafe usage of shared memory within the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Windows. The application uses shared memory to communicate with the Windows OS and other applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The application stores sensitive information, such as usernames, meeting details, and authentication tokens, in a shared memory space without adequate protection.
*   **Unsafe Shared Memory Usage:** The shared memory region is accessible to other processes on the local system, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the shared memory.
*   Compromised information could include usernames, meeting data, and authentication tokens.
*   This information could be used by an attacker to conduct further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires an attacker to have local access to the system running the vulnerable Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App.
*   **Malicious Application:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by running a malicious application designed to read the shared memory space.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated on the local system.
*   The attacker must have permissions to view system memory.
*   The attacker needs to execute a malicious application on the same system where the vulnerable application is running.

**Additional Information:**

*   Proof-of-concept exploit code is known to be available.
*   There are no workarounds available.
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Windows releases prior to 41.2.
*   The vulnerability also affects Cisco Webex Meetings Server versions prior to the specific fixed releases.
*   The vulnerability is classified as medium severity with a CVSS base score of 5.5 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).
