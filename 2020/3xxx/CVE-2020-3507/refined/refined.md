Based on the provided documents, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-3507:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to missing checks when Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras process a Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) packet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Missing input validation checks when processing CDP packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the affected IP camera.
- An attacker can cause the affected IP camera to reload unexpectedly, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same local network as the target device.
- The attack is achieved by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to the targeted IP camera.
- No user interaction (UI:N) is required.
- No privileges (PR:N) are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be in the same broadcast domain (Layer 2 adjacent) as the vulnerable Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Camera.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras running a firmware version earlier than 1.0.9-4 with the Cisco Discovery Protocol enabled are vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Camera Firmware release 1.0.9-4 or later.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8, rated as HIGH severity.
- There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
