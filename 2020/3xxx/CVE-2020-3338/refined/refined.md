Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-3338

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper error handling when processing inbound PIM6 (Protocol Independent Multicast for IPv6) packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory leak vulnerability within the PIM6 application due to the way crafted packets are processed

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) condition on the affected device.
- The memory leak causes the PIM6 application to stop processing legitimate PIM6 traffic over time, leading to the DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker sending multiple crafted PIM6 packets to an affected device.
- Unauthenticated attacker, no user privileges required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send crafted PIM6 packets to the target device over the network.
- No authentication is required.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches
- Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches
