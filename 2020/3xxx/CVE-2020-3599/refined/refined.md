- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web-based management interface of Cisco ASA Software does not properly validate user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and persuade a user of the Cisco ASA web management interface to click it. The attacker does not need any authentication to perform the attack but needs to be able to reach the vulnerable device through the network.
