Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3367:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the log subscription subsystem of Cisco AsyncOS for the Cisco Secure Web Appliance. This lack of validation occurs in both the web interface and the command-line interface (CLI).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection flaw. An attacker can inject scripting commands into the log subscription subsystem due to the lack of input sanitization.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The system fails to properly validate and sanitize user-provided input, allowing for the injection of malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the affected appliance.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can elevate their privileges to *root* level, gaining full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have local access to the affected device.
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the affected device through the web interface or CLI to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the Cisco Secure Web Appliance, having valid credentials for either the web interface or the CLI.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the appliance, whether physical or via remote access with sufficient privileges.

**Summary:**

This vulnerability in Cisco AsyncOS for the Secure Web Appliance allows an authenticated local attacker to achieve root level command execution via a command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation in the log subscription subsystem, affecting both the web interface and CLI.
