Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3513:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect validations in boot scripts during the initialization routines of Cisco IOS XE Software on Cisco ASR 900 Series Aggregation Services Routers with a Route Switch Processor 3 (RSP3).
*   These incorrect validations occur when specific ROM monitor (ROMMON) variables are set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** Boot scripts fail to properly validate ROMMON variables during bootup.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system (OS) with *root* privileges.
*   **Persistent Code Execution:** The attacker can achieve persistent code execution at bootup, breaking the chain of trust.
*   **Full Control of the Device**: This means the attacker gains complete control of the vulnerable device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to copy a specific file to the local file system of the affected device.
*   **ROMMON Variable Manipulation:** The attacker needs to define specific ROMMON variables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated, Local Access with High Privileges:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with high privileges, including access to the root shell.
*   **Physical Access:** Alternatively, the attacker can achieve the same results with physical access to the device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text mentions that this vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 900 Series Aggregation Services Routers with an RSP3 installed if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software. It also specifies the affected versions, which can be found in the provided CSAF document.
* There are no workarounds for this vulnerability, and a software update is required to remediate it.
*   The advisory provides a CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.7, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating a medium severity but with high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
