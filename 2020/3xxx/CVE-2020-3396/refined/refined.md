Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the fact that control data for the USB 3.0 SSD on Cisco IOS XE devices is not stored on the internal boot flash. This allows an attacker to remove the USB SSD and directly modify its contents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Storage of Control Data:** The lack of secure storage for the USB SSD's control data on the internal boot flash is the core vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Physical Security:** The ability to physically remove the USB SSD is a weakness that enables the attack vector.
*   **Insufficient Namespace Protection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass namespace container protections, granting elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to remove container protections and perform file actions outside of the container's namespace with root privileges.
*   **Arbitrary File Modification:** The attacker can modify or delete files on the USB SSD.
*   **Potential for System Compromise:** By gaining root privileges, the attacker could potentially compromise the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector is physical access to the vulnerable device.
*   **USB SSD Removal:** The attacker must be able to physically remove the USB 3.0 SSD from the Cisco device.
*   **External Modification:** The attacker uses another device to modify the contents of the USB SSD.
*   **Reinsertion:** The attacker reinserts the modified USB SSD back into the Cisco device to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical access:**  The attacker needs physical access to the device to remove the USB drive.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with a privilege level high enough to enable the IOx Guest Shell.
*   **Technical Expertise:** The attacker needs the technical ability to modify the file system of the USB drive using another device.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Catalyst 9300 and 9500 Series Switches running vulnerable versions of Cisco IOS XE Software with the IOx Guest Shell enabled and a USB 3.0 SSD installed.
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was found internally by Victor Kamensky of Cisco.
*   The CVSS score is 6.8 (Medium) with vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N`
*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
