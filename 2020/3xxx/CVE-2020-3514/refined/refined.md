Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3514:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient protections on a configuration file used during the startup of Cisco FTD instances running in a multi-instance environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficient File Protections:** A container configuration file lacks adequate access controls.
*   **Container Escape:** The vulnerability enables an attacker to break out of their allocated container.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation results in the attacker gaining root privileges within the host namespace.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the host system.
*   **Compromise of Other Instances:** Attackers can potentially impact other Cisco FTD instances running on the same host.
*   **Host System Compromise:** Attackers can potentially impact the host Cisco FXOS device.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability Impact**: The vulnerability has a high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to log into the device.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to modify a specific container configuration file on the underlying file system.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Firepower 4100 and 9300 series security appliances when configured for multi-instance operation.
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability other than upgrading to a fixed software release.
*   The vulnerability was discovered through internal security testing.
