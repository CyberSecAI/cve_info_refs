The memory consumption may negatively impact other processes that are running on the device.  These vulnerabilities are due to the incorrect handling of IGMP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted IGMP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to immediately crash the IGMP process or cause memory exhaustion, resulting in other processes becoming unstable. These processes may include, but are not limited to, interior and exterior routing protocols.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. There are multiple mitigations available to customers depending on their needs.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxr-dvmrp-memexh-dSmpdvfz>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect any Cisco device that is running any release of Cisco IOS XR Software if an active interface is configured under multicast routing and it is receiving DVMRP traffic. Determine Whether Multicast Routing Is Enabled An administrator can determine whether multicast routing is enabled on a device by issuing the **show igmp interface** command. The following output shows a device with multicast routing enabled:  ```   RP/0/0/CPU0:router# show igmp interfaceLoopback0 is up, line protocol is up  Internet address is 10.144.144.144/32  IGMP is enabled on interface  Current IGMP version is 3  IGMP query interval is 60 seconds  IGMP querier timeout is 125 seconds  IGMP max query response time is 10 seconds  Last member query response interval is 1 seconds  IGMP activity: 3 joins, 0 leaves  IGMP querying router is 10.144.144.144 (this system)TenGigE0/4/0/0 is up, line protocol is up  Internet address is 10.114.8.44/24  IGMP is enabled on interface  Current IGMP version is 3  IGMP query interval is 60 seconds  IGMP querier timeout is 125 seconds  IGMP max query response time is 10 seconds  Last member query response interval is 1 seconds  IGMP activity: 9 joins, 4 leaves  IGMP querying router is 10.114.8.11   ```  If the output of **show igmp interface** is empty, multicast routing is not enabled and the device is not affected by these vulnerabilities. Determine Whether the Device Is Receiving DVMRP Traffic An administrator can determine whether the device is receiving DVMRP traffic by issuing the **show igmp traffic** command. The following output shows a device that is receiving DVMRP traffic:  ```   RP/0/0/CPU0:router#show igmp trafficFri Feb 13 12:00:00.000 UTCIGMP Traffic CountersElapsed time since counters cleared: 01:09:27                                   Received       SentValid IGMP Packets                   380220        301Queries                                   0        143Reports                                   0        158Leaves                                    0          0Mtrace packets                            0          0DVMRP packets                        380220          0   ```  If the **DVMRP packets** entry contains values of zero in the first column, and the counters remain zero on subsequent execution of the command, the device is not receiving DVMRP traffic. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * These vulnerabilities result in memory exhaustion, which can impact other processes on the device. It is possible to recover the memory consumed by the IGMP process by restarting the IGMP process with the **process restart igmp** command as follows:  ```   RP/0/0/CPU0:router# process restart igmp   ```  In the case of an immediate IGMP process crash, it is not necessary to manually restart the IGMP process because the system has already performed that action. This automated restart will recover the consumed memory.  When considering mitigations, it should be understood that for the memory exhaustion case, the rate limiter and the access control methods are effective. For the immediate IGMP process crash case, only the access control method is effective.  Indicators of Compromise  * When a device is experiencing memory exhaustion based on exploitation of these vulnerabilities, the following messages may be seen in the system logs:  ```   RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:Aug 28 03:46:10.375 UTC: raw_ip[399]: %PKT_INFRA-PQMON-6-QUEUE_DROP : Taildrop on XIPC queue 1 owned by igmp (jid=1175)RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:Aug 28 03:46:10.380 UTC: raw_ip[399]: %PKT_INFRA-PQMON-6-QUEUE_DROP : Taildrop on XIPC queue 1 owned by igmp (jid=1175)RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:Aug 28 03:49:22.850 UTC: dumper[61]: %OS-DUMPER-7-DUMP_REQUEST : Dump request for process pkg/bin/igmpRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:Aug 28 03:49:22.851 UTC: dumper[61]: %OS-DUMPER-7-DUMP_ATTRIBUTE : Dump request with attribute 7 for process pkg/bin/igmpRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:Aug 28 03:49:22.851 UTC: dumper[61]: %OS-DUMPER-4-SIGSEGV : Thread 9 received SIGSEGV - Segmentation Fault   ```  When a device has experienced a crash of the IGMP process, the following messages may be seen in the system logs:  ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:Aug 30 17:21:47.653 UTC: igmp[1169]: %HA-HA_WD_LIB-4-RLIMIT : wd_handle_sigxfsz: Reached 90% of RLIMIT_DATARP/0/RSP0/CPU0:Aug 30 17:21:47.653 UTC: igmp[1169]: %ROUTING-IPV4_IGMP-4-OOM_STATE_THROTTLE : Received Critical memory depletion warning, stop creating new igmp stateRP/0/RSP1/CPU0:Aug 30 17:23:50.442 UTC: sysmgr[94]: igmp(1) (jid 1169) (pid 121667828) (fail_count 2) abnormally terminated, restart scheduled   ```  Workarounds  * Although there are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities, there are multiple mitigations available to customers depending on their needs.  As a mitigation for the memory exhaustion case, it is recommended that customers implement a rate limiter. This will require that customers understand their current rate of IGMP traffic and set a rate lower than the current average rate. It is worth noting that there is a default limiter in place. In configuration mode, the customer can enter the **lpts pifib hardware police flow igmp rate** command as follows:  ```   RP/0/0/CPU0:router(config)# lpts pifib hardware police flow igmp rate     ```  This command will not remove the exploit vector. However, the command will reduce the traffic rate and increase the time necessary for successful exploitation. The customer can use this time to perform recovery actions.  As a mitigation for both the memory exhaustion case and the immediate IGMP process crash case, customers may implement an access control entry (ACE) to an existing interface access control list (ACL). Alternatively, the customer can create a new ACL for a specific interface that denies DVMRP traffic inbound on that interface. The following example creates an ACL and denies DVMRP traffic:  ```   RP/0/0/CPU0:router(config)# ipv4 access-list  deny igmp any any dvmrp   ```  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Cisco has released Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMUs) to address these vulnerabilities.

| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.6 |

It is possible to recover the memory consumed by the IGMP process by restarting the IGMP process with the process restart igmp command as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/0/CPU0:router# process restart igmp\r\n\r\nIn the case of an immediate IGMP process crash, it is not necessary to manually restart the IGMP process because the system has already performed that action. This automated restart will recover the consumed memory.\r\n\r\nWhen considering mitigations, it should be understood that for the memory exhaustion case, the rate limiter and the access control methods are effective.

"title": "Workarounds",
"text": "Although there are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities, there are multiple mitigations available to customers depending on their needs.\r\n\r\nAs a mitigation for the memory exhaustion case, it is recommended that customers implement a rate limiter. This will require that customers understand their current rate of IGMP traffic and set a rate lower than the current average rate. It is worth noting that there is a default limiter in place. In configuration mode, the customer can enter the lpts pifib hardware police flow igmp rate command as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/0/CPU0:router(config)# lpts pifib hardware police flow igmp rate \r\n\r\nThis command will not remove the exploit vector. However, the command will reduce the traffic rate and increase the time necessary for successful exploitation. The customer can use this time to perform recovery actions.\r\n\r\nAs a mitigation for both the memory exhaustion case and the immediate IGMP process crash case, customers may implement an access control entry (ACE) to an existing interface access control list (ACL). Alternatively, the customer can create a new ACL for a specific interface that denies DVMRP traffic inbound on that interface. The following example creates an ACL and denies DVMRP traffic:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/0/CPU0:router(config)# ipv4 access-list  deny igmp any any dvmrp"

"title": "Fixed Software",
"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Fixed Releases\r\nCisco has released Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMUs) to address these vulnerabilities.
