The vulnerability is due to improper validation of string input from certain fields in Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a stack overflow, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges on an affected device.  **Note:** Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200205-iosxr-cdp-rce>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they have Cisco Discovery Protocol enabled both globally and on at least one interface and if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software (32-bit or 64-bit):    + ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers   + Carrier Routing System (CRS)   + IOS XRv 9000 Router   + Network Convergence System (NCS) 540 Series Routers   + Network Convergence System (NCS) 560 Series Routers   + Network Convergence System (NCS) 1000 Series Routers   + Network Convergence System (NCS) 5000 Series Routers   + Network Convergence System (NCS) 5500 Series Routers   + Network Convergence System (NCS) 6000 Series Routers This vulnerability also affects third-party white box routers if they have Cisco Discovery Protocol enabled both globally and on at least one interface and if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software.  **Note:** Cisco Discovery Protocol is not enabled in Cisco IOS XR Software by default.  For information about which Cisco IOS XR Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine the Status of Cisco Discovery Protocol Administrators can determine whether Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled on a device by using the **show running-config | include cdp** command in the device CLI. If the command returns at least the following lines, Cisco Discovery Protocol is enabled globally and on at least one interface:  ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios##show running-config | include cdp   Mon Dec  2 17:00:27.921 UTC   Building configuration...   cdp   cdp   .   .   .      ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Network Convergence System (NCS) 520 Series Routers. Cisco has also confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco software:    + FXOS Software   + IOS Software   + IOS XE Software   + NX-OS Software   + UCS Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  However, customers who do not use the Cisco Discovery Protocol feature can disable it either globally to fully close the attack vector or on individual interfaces to reduce the attack surface. Disable Cisco Discovery Protocol Globally To disable Cisco Discovery Protocol globally on devices that are running Cisco IOS XR Software, administrators can use the **no cdp**  command in global configuration mode, as shown in the following example:  ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#conf t   Mon Dec  2 17:58:08.556 UTC   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios(config)#no cdp          RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios(config)#exitUncommitted changes found, commit them before exiting(yes/no/cancel)? [cancel]:yes   ``` Disable Cisco Discovery Protocol on an Interface To disable Cisco Discovery Protocol on an interface on devices that are running Cisco IOS XR Software, administrators can use the **no cdp**  command in interface configuration mode, as shown in the following example:  ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#conf t   Mon Dec  2 18:00:08.622 UTC   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios(config)#interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios(config-if)#no cdp   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios(config-if)#end   Uncommitted changes found, commit them before exiting(yes/no/cancel)? [cancel]:yes   ```  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.8 |
