Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3281:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the storage of certain unencrypted credentials within the audit logging component of Cisco DNA Center.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary weakness is the failure to encrypt sensitive credentials before logging them in the audit logs. This exposes these credentials to unauthorized access if the logs are compromised.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to view sensitive information that they should not normally have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Theft:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to obtain credentials stored in the audit logs.
- **Lateral Movement:**  The stolen credentials can potentially allow an attacker to discover and manage network devices that they may not normally have access to.
- **Broader Network Access:** Exploiting the vulnerability can give an attacker unauthorized access to a wider range of the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** The attack can be performed remotely by an attacker that has authenticated to the DNA center.
- **Access to Audit Logs:** The attacker needs access to the audit logs to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the Cisco DNA Center.
- **Access to Logs:** The attacker needs some form of access to the system's audit logs.
