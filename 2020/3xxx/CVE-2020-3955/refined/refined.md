- The VMware ESXi Host Client does not properly sanitize or neutralize script-related HTML when displaying virtual machine attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows a malicious actor to inject malicious script that will be executed in a victim's browser when they view the compromised virtual machine using the ESXi Host Client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to a virtual machine, and have the ability to change its system properties from within the guest OS.
- The attacker does not necessarily require network access to the ESXi host itself, but the victim must access the ESXi host's web interface.
- The attacker needs a victim to view the modified VM from the ESXi Host Client web interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 base score of 8.3, indicating a high severity.
