Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-3483:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Duo Network Gateway (DNG) was logging customer-provided SSL certificates and private keys in plain text due to a flaw in validation logic within a form field used during the certificate upload process. The application was not properly excluding the certificate and private key values from the log data it was generating.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unprotected Storage of Credentials:** Private keys, which are sensitive credentials used for encryption and authentication, were being stored in plain text within log files. This exposed them to unauthorized access. (CWE-256)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Decryption and Manipulation of SSL/TLS Connections:** An attacker with access to the DNG logs and the ability to intercept network traffic could decrypt and manipulate SSL/TLS connections to the DNG and to protected applications behind it. This allows for man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Impersonation:** The compromised private key could be used to impersonate the DNG server or the application it protects.
- **Data Exposure:** The attacker would be able to view and potentially modify data transmitted over the encrypted connections.
- **Broader Compromise:** If a wildcard certificate is compromised, it could be used to intercept traffic sent to other services.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Access to DNG Logs:** An attacker needs access to the DNG host's operating system where the logs are stored. This could be through a compromised DNG server, a compromised system with access to the log files or unauthorized access.
- **Network Traffic Interception:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic between a user and the DNG to leverage a compromised key, once obtained.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have access to the file system of the DNG host to retrieve the plaintext private keys from the log files.
- **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between a user and the DNG server to decrypt and manipulate the traffic.

**Additional Information:**

-   **Affected Versions:**  Duo Network Gateway (DNG) versions 1.3.3 through 1.5.7.
-   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to DNG version 1.5.8 and review the logs for any occurrences of the private keys.
-   **CVSS Score:** 8.1 (Critical)
-   **Search String:** The provided search string to look for the logged private keys is `host_key": ["---`.
