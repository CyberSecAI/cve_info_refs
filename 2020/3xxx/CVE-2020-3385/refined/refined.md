Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3385:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the deep packet inspection (DPI) engine's insufficient handling of malformed packets. Specifically, the DPI engine within Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Routers doesn't properly process certain crafted packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of malformed packets by the DPI engine.
- Lack of adequate input validation or sanitization of network packets processed by the DPI engine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit can cause the affected device to reboot, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This leads to network disruption and unavailability of the affected router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An adjacent attacker sends specially crafted malformed packets through an affected Cisco SD-WAN vEdge router.
- The attack is network-based, where the attacker needs to be on the same network segment or have a network path to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be adjacent to the vulnerable device (i.e., on the same network segment).
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the targeted device.
- No authentication is needed for exploitation

**Additional Details:**
