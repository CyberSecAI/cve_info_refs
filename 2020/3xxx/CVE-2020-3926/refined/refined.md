Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3926:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insecure API calls within the ServiSign DLL file. Specifically, there is a lack of proper input validation and access control when handling file paths. The vulnerability is present in the ServiSign system, which provides cross-platform digital signature and verification solutions. The vulnerability arises because the software does not check or filter path parameters passed to certain file-handling APIs, allowing attackers to specify arbitrary paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The DLL file contains an API that allows an attacker to read the content of any file on the user's computer. The lack of path filtering or access control on this function makes the system vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to read sensitive files on the victim's computer without authentication. This could expose confidential user data or system configuration information.
*   **Remote exploitation:** The attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code in phishing or advertisement websites. When a user browses these sites, the code can read specific files on the system and upload them to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by embedding malicious code in web pages, such as phishing or advertising sites.
*   **Phishing Websites:** Attackers can create phishing websites that include malicious JavaScript code to trigger the arbitrary file read via the vulnerable ServiSign component.
*   **XSS payloads:** The article mentions "injecting malicious Javascript code by XSS payloads in phishing websites". This indicates the possibility of exploiting XSS vulnerabilities to deliver the attack

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious Code Injection:** Attackers need the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages.
*   **Target User Interaction:** The victim user needs to browse a webpage containing the malicious code while having the vulnerable ServiSign software installed on their system.
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability resides within the ServiSign component, specifically within the DLL file used by the Windows version.
* The affected versions are ServiSign for Windows ver. <= 1.0.19.0617.
* The vulnerability is part of a set of three vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-3925, CVE-2020-3926, CVE-2020-3927) found in the same software, all related to insecure API usage.
