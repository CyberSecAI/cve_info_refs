Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2020-3207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation checks during the processing of boot options in specific Cisco IOS XE Software switches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The software fails to adequately validate boot options, allowing for the inclusion of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass Secure Boot:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to bypass the Secure Boot process.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute attacker-provided code with root-level privileges.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker root-level access, leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the device.
- **Boot Options Modification:** Attackers need to be able to modify the device boot options.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with root shell access to the underlying operating system.
- **Physical or Remote Access:** While the advisory specifies "local attacker", the root access required might be achievable remotely depending on the device configuration and existing vulnerabilities.

**Summary:**
This vulnerability allows a local attacker with root access to modify boot options and inject malicious code during the device boot process, leading to a full system compromise with root privileges by bypassing Secure Boot. The vulnerability exists because of insufficient input validation of boot options.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Cisco Catalyst series switches.
- No workarounds are available.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- The CVSS score is 6.7 which is rated as MEDIUM severity, however, the impact of exploitation is very high.
