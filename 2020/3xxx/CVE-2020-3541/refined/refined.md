- Information disclosure vulnerability where sensitive information, specifically NTLM credentials, can be read from log files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to sensitive information stored in the log files, specifically NTLM authentication exchanges.
- This information could be used in further attacks, potentially gaining unauthorized access to resources or escalating privileges.
- The impact can vary based on the information exposed and the attacker's actions after the exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the system is required to read the log files stored in the application directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to have elevated privileges on the local system to read the log files.
