Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3578:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of URLs when portal access rules are configured within the web services interface of Cisco ASA and FTD software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper URL Validation:** The core issue is the lack of adequate checks on URLs when processing portal access rules. This allows an attacker to craft specific URLs to bypass intended restrictions.
- **Access Rule Bypass:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to parts of the WebVPN portal, which should be blocked according to configured portal access rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can circumvent configured access rules.
- **Partial Information Disclosure/Manipulation:** Although the vulnerability's CVSS score indicates a low impact on integrity, it is possible that exploitation could expose parts of the WebVPN portal to unauthorized users that it shouldn't. The advisory states that it allows an attacker to "access parts of the WebVPN portal that are supposed to be blocked."

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Crafted URLs:** Attackers gain access by requesting specifically crafted URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:**  The attacker must have network connectivity to the affected device.
- **No Credentials Required:** The attack can be carried out without the need for valid user credentials.
- **Understanding of URL Structure:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific URLs that can trigger the bypass.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory includes specific configurations for ASA and FTD that are vulnerable, involving AnyConnect IKEv2, AnyConnect SSL VPN, and Clientless SSL VPN.
- There are no workarounds available to mitigate the vulnerability.
- Fixed software versions are provided in the advisory for both ASA and FTD software.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- It was found that a new Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance vulnerability could affect the fixed releases recommended for code trains 9.13 and 9.14.
