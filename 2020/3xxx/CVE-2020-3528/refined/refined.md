Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3528:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incomplete input validation within the OSPFv2 implementation of Cisco ASA and FTD software. Specifically, the software fails to properly validate certain OSPFv2 packets containing Link-Local Signaling (LLS) data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of thorough validation of OSPFv2 packets with LLS data. This allows for the processing of malformed packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to the affected device reloading, causing a denial of service. The device becomes unavailable due to the forced reboot.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be initiated remotely.
*   **Network-Based:** The attacker sends malformed OSPFv2 packets over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device.
*   **OSPF Knowledge:** An understanding of the OSPFv2 protocol and its LLS data is likely needed to craft the malformed packets.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software, specifically when configured for OSPFv2 routing. Devices using only OSPFv3 are not affected.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability; patching is necessary.
*   **Vendor Fix:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 8.6, categorized as "HIGH" severity, with vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
*   **CWE:** CWE-400 - Resource Consumption
*   **Exploitation:** There is no indication of public exploits of this vulnerability at the time of the advisory
*   **Cisco Bug ID:** CSCvt83121
