Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3512:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) messages within the PROFINET LLDP message handler of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of proper input validation for LLDP messages processed by the PROFINET handler.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) condition by triggering a crash and subsequent reload of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker must be on the same network segment as the targeted device.
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a crafted malicious LLDP message to an affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be unauthenticated and located on the same network segment as the vulnerable Cisco device.
- They need to be capable of crafting and sending malicious LLDP messages.

**Additional Information:**

- The PROFINET feature is enabled by default on vulnerable platforms.
- The vulnerability affects various Cisco Industrial Ethernet devices including:
    - Catalyst IE3200/IE3300/IE3400 Rugged Switches
    - Embedded Services 2020/3300 Series Switches
    - Industrial Ethernet 2000/2000U/3000/4000/4010/5000 Series Switches
- There are no workarounds besides disabling the PROFINET feature entirely (which may not be feasible for users that require this functionality).
- Cisco IOS XR Software and Cisco NX-OS Software are not affected by this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
