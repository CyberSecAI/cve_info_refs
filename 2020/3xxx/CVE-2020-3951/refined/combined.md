##### **3a. Privilege escalation vulnerability via setuid binaries (CVE-2020-3950 )**

**Description**

VMware Fusion, VMRC for Mac and Horizon Client for Mac contain a privilege escalation vulnerability due to improper use of setuid binaries.

**Known Attack Vectors**

Attackers with non-administrative access to a guest VM with virtual printing enabled may exploit this issue to create a denial-of-service condition of the Thinprint service running on the system where Workstation or Horizon Client is installed.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2020-3951, apply the patches listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Resolution Matrix' found below.

**Workarounds**

None.

**Additional Documentation**
