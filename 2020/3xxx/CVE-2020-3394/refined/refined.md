Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a logic error in the implementation of the `enable` command within Cisco NX-OS software when the `enable secret` feature is configured.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A flaw exists in how the `enable` command handles authentication when the `enable secret` feature is enabled.
- The `enable secret` command was intended only for migrating configurations from Cisco IOS to Cisco NX-OS and serves no other purpose.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full administrative privileges on the affected device without knowing the `enable` password.
- An attacker could potentially take complete control of the device, leading to confidentiality, integrity, and availability issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local.
- An attacker needs valid user credentials to log in to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to log in to the device using valid user credentials.
- The attacker needs to execute the `enable` command.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `enable secret` feature is disabled by default.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches running in standalone NX-OS mode.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is the recommended method for managing privileges in Cisco NX-OS.
- The `enable secret` command should be removed once RBAC is configured.
- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- There is no evidence of public exploitation.

**Affected Products (more detail than CVE description):**
- Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches
- Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode when running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS software with the `feature privilege` and `enable secret` commands configured.
- Vulnerable versions include 9.2(1), 9.2(2), 9.2(2t), 9.2(3), 9.2(3y), 9.2(4), 9.2(2v), 9.3(1), 9.3(2), 9.3(3), and 9.3(1z).

**Workarounds:**
- Configure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Remove the `enable secret` command from the configuration.

**Detection:**
- Use the `show accounting log | include "enable"` command to check for unauthorized privilege escalations.
