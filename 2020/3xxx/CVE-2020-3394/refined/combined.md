| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.8 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches Privilege Escalation Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-n3n9k-priv-escal-3QhXJBC  First Published: 2020 August 26 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2020 August 26 20:59 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [Yes](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvt77885](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt77885)     CVE-2020-3394     CWE-285       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2020-3394     CWE-285       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-n3n9k-priv-escal-3QhXJBC/csaf/cisco-sa-n3n9k-priv-escal-3QhXJBC.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Enable Secret feature of Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an authenticated, local attacker to issue the **enable** command and get full administrative privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials for the affected device.  The vulnerability is due to a logic error in the implementation of the **enable** command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the device and issuing the **enable** command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain full administrative privileges without using the **enable** password.  **Note:** The Enable Secret feature is disabled by default.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-n3n9k-priv-escal-3QhXJBC>  This advisory is part of the August 2020 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes seven Cisco Security Advisories that describe seven vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: August 2020 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74239).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software and have the **feature privilege** command and the **enable secret** command configured:    + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability. Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:   + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects  Details  * The **enable secret** command was added to Cisco NX-OS Software as a tool for migrating configurations from Cisco IOS Software to Cisco NX-OS Software *only.* The command serves no other purpose in Cisco NX-OS Software and should otherwise be disabled. The **enable secret** command will be removed in future releases.  The **enable secret** command is used in Cisco IOS Software to set a password that grants a user privileged administrative access to a Cisco IOS Software system. In Cisco NX-OS Software, there is no concept of an **enable-secret** or **enable-password** setting. Privileges are managed using role-based access control (RBAC). The functional equivalent to enabling mode access on a Cisco IOS Software device is assignment of an account to the **network-admin** (global privileged access) or **vdc-admin** (virtual device context [VDC]-specific privileged access) role in Cisco NX-OS Software.  For additional information, see the [Cisco Guide to Securing NX-OS Software Devices](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/securing_nx_os.html).  Indicators of Compromise  * To determine whether this vulnerability has been exploited, use the **show accounting log | include "enable"** command. The following example shows the output of this command after a low-privileged user has elevated their privilege by using the **enable** command:  ```   nxos# show accounting log | include "enable" type=update:id=console0:user=guest:cmd=enable (SUCCESS)type=update:id=console0:user=guest:cmd=enable 15 (SUCCESS)      ```  Workarounds  * There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.  Cisco NX-OS Software uses RBAC to manage user accounts and privileges. For guidance, see the [Configuring User Accounts and RBAC](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/4_1/nx-os/security/configuration/guide/sec_rbac.html) section of the Cisco NX-OS Security Configuration Guide.  Once RBAC is configured, remove the **enable secret** command from the configuration.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Cisco NX-OS Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software, platform, and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.  Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a release-for example, **7.0(3)I7(5)** for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or **14.0(1h)** for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:    Cisco NX-OS Software   Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode   MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   Nexus 1000V Series Switches   Nexus 3000 Series Switches   Nexus 5000 Series Switches   Nexus 6000 Series Switches   Nexus 7000 Series Switches   Nexus 9000 Series Switches        By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search. Additional Resources For help determining the best Cisco NX-OS Software release for a Cisco Nexus Switch, see the following Recommended Releases documents. If a security advisory recommends a later release, Cisco recommends following the advisory guidance.

If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software, platform, and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.\r\n\r\nCustomers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a release���for example, 7.0(3)I7(5) for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or 14.0(1h) for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:\r\n Cisco NX-OS Software Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches Nexus 1000V Series Switches Nexus 3000 Series Switches Nexus 5000 Series Switches Nexus 6000 Series Switches Nexus 7000 Series Switches Nexus 9000 Series Switches\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search.\r\n Additional Resources\r\nFor help determining the best Cisco NX-OS Software release for a Cisco Nexus Switch, see the following Recommended Releases documents. If a security advisory recommends a later release, Cisco recommends following the advisory guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco MDS Series Switches [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/mds9000/sw/b\_MDS\_NX-OS\_Recommended\_Releases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 1000V for VMware Switch [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus1000/sw/recommended\_releases/b\_Cisco\_N1KV\_VMware\_MinRecommendedReleases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/recommended\_release/b\_Minimum\_and\_Recommended\_Cisco\_NX-OS\_Releases\_for\_Cisco\_Nexus\_3000\_Series\_Switches.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 5500 Platform Switches [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5500/sw/release/recommended\_releases/n5500\_recommended\_nx-os\_releases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 5600 Platform Switches [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5600/sw/release/recommended\_releases/n5600\_recommended\_nx-os\_releases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 6000 Series Switches [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus6000/sw/release/recommended\_releases/recommended\_nx-os\_releases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/nx-os/recommended\_releases/recommended\_nx-os\_releases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/recommended\_release/b\_Minimum\_and\_Recommended\_Cisco\_NX-OS\_Releases\_for\_Cisco\_Nexus\_9000\_Series\_Switches.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI-Mode Switches [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/recommended-release/b\_Recommended\_Cisco\_ACI\_Releases.html\"]\r\n\r\nTo determine the best release for Cisco UCS Software, see the Recommended Releases documents in the release notes for the device."
