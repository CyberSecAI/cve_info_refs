- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because different installations of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) share a static encryption key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Use of a static encryption key shared across different installations. This constitutes a hard-coded cryptographic key.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and perform arbitrary actions through the REST API with administrative privileges.
- **Attack vectors**:  Remote, network-based attack. An attacker can craft a valid session token using the static encryption key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to reach the REST API of the affected DCNM instance and have knowledge of the static encryption key. No prior authentication is required.
