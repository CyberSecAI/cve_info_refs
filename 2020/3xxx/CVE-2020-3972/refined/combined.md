## Resolved Issues

* **Intermittent BSOD is seen in guest VMs due to NSX Network Introspection driver (vnetWFP) in a NSX environment.**

  NSX Network Introspection driver (vnetWFP) can cause OS crash during processing network connections, typically over loopback address. This behavior is seen in VMware Tools 11.0.0 and later versions.

  This issue is fixed in this release.
* **NSX Guest Introspection drivers (vsepflt and vnetWFP) can leak memory while processing network traffic for ICMP or UDP packets.**

  Memory leak can be observed in NSX Guest Introspection drivers (vsepflt and vnetWFP) when installed in NSX environment. This can lead to customers reaching the memory limits on their respective systems after some time. This issue is seen in VMware Tools 11.0.0 and later versions.

  This issue is fixed in this release.
* **Denial-of-service vulnerability in the Host-Guest File System (HGFS) implementation of VMware Tools for macOS.**

  VMware Tools for macOS contains a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Host-Guest File System (HGFS) implementation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier [CVE-2020-3972](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3972) to this issue. For more information, see [VMSA-2020-0014](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0014.html).

  This issue is fixed in this release.

## Known Issues

* **After upgrading to a new version VMware Tools with installer parameter to remove the NetworkIntrospection feature, old version of vnetflt or vnetWFP driver service still runs.**

  After the upgrade, the NetworkIntrospection feature is not present in the system's VMware Tools MSI database, but the feature's vnetflt or vnetWFP driver service still exists.

  Workaround:

  Refer to [KB 78016](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78016).

  Note: Future tools upgrade from version 11.1.0 to a newer tools version will not have the issue.
* **VMware Tools upgrade fails on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 without SHA-2 code signing support.**

  Microsoft has changed Windows driver signing to use SHA-2 algorithm exclusively starting December 3, 2019. Hence, legacy Windows systems without SHA-2 code signing support fails driver signature verification.

  Workaround:

  Refer to [KB 78708](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78708).
* **VMware Tools 11.1.0 fails to install on a VM with VMware Horizon Agent 7.7 or earlier installed.**

  VMware Tools installation setup fails with a popup message: "Setup failed to install the SVGA driver automatically. This driver will have to be installed manually."

  Workaround:

  To workaround this issue:

  1. Choose Custom Setup.
  2. Unselect the SVGA Driver
  3. Install VMware Tools.

  Setup will complete successfully and retain the existing installed SVGA Driver. To reinstall the SVGA driver on a failed VMware Tools install, refer to [KB1016770](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1016770).
* **Upgrade of VMware Tools hangs in a Windows Server 2008 Virtual Machine.**

  VMware Tools upgrade process hangs in a Windows Server 2008 VM. This happens because the 'vcredist' bundled in the tools installer gets stuck and does not return.

  Workaround:

  If you have Windows remote management interface to the VM in the guest network, then stop the process when it hangs, like '"c:\vcredist\_x86.exe" /quiet /noRestart -burn.unelevated BurnPipe.{32940ADA-3765-4E48-8624-3DB276BB8083} {D6A63D73-EE4C-4698-8D19-C926D5E854A4} 1088'.

  You can also opt to stop the child process manually.
* **AppDefense driver glxgi logs an error in the event viewer.**

  AppDefense driver glxgi logs an error in the event viewer similar to the following:

  "The glxgi service failed to start due to the following error: A device attached to the system is not functioning."

  The events are observed when Guest Integrity is disabled.

  Workaround:

  These events do not impact the system and are safe to ignore.
* **Event Viewer driver warnings generated by VMware Tools boot start drivers glxgi, pvscsi, vsepflt, and vsock.**

  When you have a secure boot VM with Microsoft Hyper-V and virtualization-based security enabled with Device Guard and Code Integrity policy set to enforced, then drivers, glxgi, pvscsi, vsepflt, and vsock might generate the event log warnings similar to the following.

  Log Name:      Microsoft-Windows-CodeIntegrity/Operational
   Source:        Microsoft-Windows-CodeIntegrity

  Operational Log:

  Warnings

  Event ID:      3083
   Level:         Warning

  Description:
   Code Integrity determined kernel module system32\DRIVERS\vsock.sys that did not meet the WHQL requirements is loaded into the system.
   Check with the publisher to see if a WHQL compliant kernel module is available.

  Workaround:

  These warnings are safe to ignore. The drivers load and operate in the normal manner.
* **Installing or upgrading versions earlier than VMware Tools 10.3.0 to VMware Tools 11.1.0 might take longer and Windows OS might need a restart.**

  Installation process might appear to be in progress and displays a message similar to the following:
   ​ "Preparing 'VMware Tools' for installation..."

  During this process, the user might be prompted to restart the operating system.

  Workaround:

  For more information, see [KB 55798](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/55798).
* **Drag functionality fails to work in Ubuntu.**

  Drag functionality fails to work in Ubuntu 16.04.4 32-bit virtual machine installed using easy install. Also, failure of copy and paste functionality is observed in the same system.

  Note: This issue is applicable for VMware Tools running on Workstation and Fusion.

  Workaround:

  + Add the modprobe.blacklist=vmwgfx linux kernel boot option.
  + To gain access to larger resolutions, remove svga.guestBackedPrimaryAware = "TRUE" option from the VMX file.
* **Shared Folders mount is unavailable on Linux VM.**

  If the **Shared Folders** feature is enabled on a Linux VM while it is powered off, shared folders mount is not available on restart.

  Note: This issue is applicable for VMware Tools running on Workstation and Fusion.

  Workaround:

  If the VM is powered on, disable and enable the **Shared Folders** feature from the interface.
   For resolving the issue permanently, edit **/etc/fstab** and add an entry to mount the Shared Folders automatically on boot.
   For example, add the line:
   vmhgfs-fuse   /mnt/hgfs    fuse    defaults,allow\_other    0    0

##### **1. Impacted Products**

* VMware Tools for macOS (VMware Tools)

##### **2. Introduction**

A denial-of-service vulnerability affecting VMware Tools for macOS was privately reported to VMware. Updates are available to address this vulnerability in affected VMware products.

##### **3a. Advisory Details**

**Description**

VMware Tools for macOS contains a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Host-Guest File System (HGFS) implementation. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Low severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [3.3](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).

**Known Attack Vendors**

Successful exploitation of this issue may allow attackers with non-admin privileges on guest macOS virtual machines to create a denial-of-service condition on their own VMs.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
1) Guest and host operating system must be macOS.
2) Shared folders (HGFS) must be enabled, and a folder (that includes at-least one file) must be selected from the host system to be shared. No folders are shared by default in any version of our products, which means this vulnerability is not exploitable by default.

**Resolution**

To remediate CVE-2020-3972 apply the patches listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' below.

**Workarounds**

None.

**Additional Documentation**

None.

**Notes**

None.

**Acknowledgements**

VMware would like to thank Jimi Sebree of Tenable Research for reporting this issue to us.
