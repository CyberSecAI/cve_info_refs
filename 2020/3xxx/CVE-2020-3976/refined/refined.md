- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A partial denial of service vulnerability exists within the authentication services of VMware ESXi and vCenter Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for the exhaustion of memory resources within the affected systems.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a degradation of performance due to memory exhaustion, resulting in a partial denial of service. The performance degradation is sustained while the attack is active.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor with network access to ESXi or vCenter Server can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the affected ESXi or vCenter server. No authentication is needed according to the CVSS vector.
