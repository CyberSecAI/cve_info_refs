The provided content is related to CVE-2020-3255.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Inefficient memory management in the packet processing functionality of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A memory exhaustion condition caused by a high rate of IPv4 or IPv6 traffic matching a configured block action in an access control policy.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Denial of service (DoS) for traffic transiting the device.
*   Sluggish performance of the management interface.

**Attack vectors:** Sending a high rate of IPv4 or IPv6 traffic through an affected device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be able to send IPv4 or IPv6 traffic to the affected device.
*   The traffic must match a configured block action in an access control policy on the FTD device.
*   The attacker is unauthenticated and remote.
