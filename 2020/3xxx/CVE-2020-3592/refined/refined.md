Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is caused by insufficient authorization checking in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Authorization Bypass:** The system fails to properly validate user privileges, allowing an attacker to potentially gain access beyond their configured authorization level.
*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The core weakness lies in inadequate checks on the authorization levels of users accessing the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Configuration Modification:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to modify the configuration of the affected system. This could lead to various impacts, potentially compromising network security, availability, and integrity.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain privileges beyond what is normally authorized for their configured user, enabling them to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Web-based Management Interface:** The attack is carried out through the web interface of the vManage software.
*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends specifically crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the vManage web interface.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software releases 20.1.12 and earlier, and Release 20.3.1.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability, and there are no workarounds available.
*   The CVE is rated as MEDIUM severity with a base CVSS score of 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).
