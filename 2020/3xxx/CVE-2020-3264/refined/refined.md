Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3264:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a **buffer overflow** in the `confd_cli` binary of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution. This binary has the S-UID bit set and is used to connect to the `confd` server.
*   The overflow occurs due to **insufficient input validation** when handling the `SSH_CONNECTION` environment variable. The second argument of the variable is copied to a stack buffer using `sprintf()` without any length checks, causing a buffer overflow.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow (CWE-120):** The primary vulnerability is a classic stack buffer overflow due to the unsafe use of `sprintf()`.
*   **Set-UID Binary:** The `confd_cli` binary has the S-UID bit set, which is intended to grant the binary access to a secret file for authentication. However, this setup allows an attacker to execute the binary with elevated privileges if the overflow is exploited.
*   **Lack of NX Bit (Non-Executable Memory):** On affected vEdge devices (MIPS64 architecture), the binary is compiled without the NX bit, allowing attackers to overwrite the return address and redirect code execution.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit can lead to a local privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to gain elevated privileges on the affected device.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** As a result of successful exploitation, an attacker could gain access to information that they are not authorized to access and make changes to the system that they are not authorized to make

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has local access to an affected device.
*   **Environment Variable Manipulation:** The attack is performed by manipulating the `SSH_CONNECTION` environment variable when executing `confd_cli`.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a local shell or command execution capabilities on the target system.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the system
*   **Ability to Manipulate Environment Variables:** The attacker must be able to set environment variables, particularly `SSH_CONNECTION`, before running `confd_cli`.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The `sprintf()` function is used to copy the second argument of the `SSH_CONNECTION` environment variable to the stack without length checks, leading to the overflow.
*   On vEdges, which are MIPS64 architecture, the big-endian layout of addresses with leading zeros makes exploiting the vulnerability more complex.
*   On controllers (Intel x86\_64 architectures), the vulnerability can be exploited by overwriting the return address to a valid gadget for further exploitation, such as a ROP chain in a user-controlled memory area.
*   The exploit cannot contain null bytes because `sprintf()` stops copying at null bytes.

**Affected Products:**

The vulnerability affects several Cisco SD-WAN products running software versions earlier than Release 19.2.2:
*   vBond Orchestrator Software
*   vEdge 100 Series Routers
*   vEdge 1000 Series Routers
*   vEdge 2000 Series Routers
*   vEdge 5000 Series Routers
*   vEdge Cloud Router Platform
*  vManage Network Management Software
*  vSmart Controller Software

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco SD-WAN Solution software Releases 18.4.5, 19.2.2, 20.1.1, 20.3.1 and later.
* There are no workarounds

**Credits:**

*   Orange Group reported this vulnerability to Cisco
*   Cyrille CHATRAS from Orange Group is credited for the discovery.
