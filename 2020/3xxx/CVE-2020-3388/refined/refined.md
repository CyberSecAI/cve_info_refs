Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3388:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation within the command-line interface (CLI) of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the CLI. This is made possible by the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The software fails to adequately check and filter user-provided input before processing it, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.
- **Root Privileges:** The injected commands are executed with root privileges, giving the attacker full control over the system. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CLI Access:** The attack vector is through the CLI of the Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the CLI. This implies that the attacker needs to have valid credentials on the system.
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the CLI of the system locally.

**Summary of Key Information:**
- The vulnerability allows a local, authenticated attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges due to insufficient input validation in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software.
- There are no known workarounds, and Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software releases.
- The CVSS score is 7.8, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
