Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an incomplete Access Control List (ACL) being applied in Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software before the client is in the "RUN" state.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Access Control:** The primary weakness is the inadequate access control during the initial stages of client association with the wireless network. Specifically, the ACL designed to restrict network access isn't fully enforced before the client reaches a "RUN" state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **ICMPv6 Traffic Injection:** An attacker can exploit this to send ICMPv6 traffic before the client is fully operational and secured by the intended ACL. This allows for potentially malicious activity or reconnaissance on the network.
- While the impact is limited to sending ICMPv6, other attack vectors and impacts might be possible, which might not be explicitly described.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Adjacent Network Access:** The attacker needs to be within the network vicinity or have an adjacent connection to the wireless network.
- **Wireless Connection:** The attacker needs to connect to the vulnerable service set identifier (SSID).
- **ICMPv6 Traffic:** Exploitation involves sending ICMPv6 traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated or authorized on the network before exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Adjacent Network:** The attacker must have the ability to connect to the vulnerable wireless network.
- **Network Knowledge:** Basic knowledge of network protocols, such as ICMPv6, is needed for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers and related products.
*   There are no known workarounds. The recommended solution is to apply the software updates.
*   The CVSS score is 4.7, with a severity rating of Medium.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
