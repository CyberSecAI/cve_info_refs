Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3236:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of CLI command arguments in Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS). Specifically, the CLI is vulnerable to path traversal techniques.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input to CLI commands. This allows an attacker to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The software fails to validate input arguments, enabling the path traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Root Shell Access:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain root shell access to the underlying operating system.
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can overwrite or read arbitrary files on the affected device. This could lead to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the affected device.
*   **CLI Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the CLI interface of the NFVIS software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid administrative credentials to access the CLI.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires access to a local shell on the vulnerable system.

**Summary of key points:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco Enterprise NFVIS software CLI.
*   It involves a path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
*   Successful exploitation allows a local attacker with administrative privileges to gain root access and read/write arbitrary files.
*   The vulnerability has been addressed in software updates, specifically in Cisco NFVIS Release 4.1.1 and later.
*   There are no known workarounds.
