Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `qmail-verify` program, which is used to validate email addresses in `netqmail`, performs file existence checks within a user's home directory while running with root privileges, without dropping those privileges first.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker can exploit this behavior to check the existence of arbitrary files and directories on the system.  Even files and directories they do not normally have access to.
- **Missing Privilege Drop:** `qmail-verify` does not drop root privileges before accessing the file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leak:** The attacker can gather information about the presence or absence of specific files, allowing them to potentially map out the file system and identify sensitive data or configuration files.
- **No direct code execution:** This vulnerability does not lead to direct code execution, but it can be a stepping stone for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** An attacker on the local system can send crafted requests to the `qmail-verify` service. The service listens on a local port by default (127.0.0.1:11113)
- **Network Attack:** Although `qmail-verify` runs on a local port, if the system has port forwarding or a publicly accessible interface connected to the service, the vulnerability could be reached from a network attack as well.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a user account on the system where `netqmail` is running.
- The attacker must be able to send network requests to `qmail-verify` service.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the file paths they intend to check.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability lies within the file system checks done by `qmail-verify` using the `stat()` function in the `verifyaddr()` function. This function uses a symbolic link to a target file to check if a file exists.
- The `stat_as()` function, which was introduced to resolve the issue in patches, now uses `setgroups()`, `setegid()`, and `seteuid()` to temporarily drop root privileges before performing file system checks.
- The `qmail-verify` service runs as root, and uses an existing user's home directory to check for the existence of `.qmail` files, which is how the attacker can test for file existence in arbitrary paths by creating a symlink in their homedir.
