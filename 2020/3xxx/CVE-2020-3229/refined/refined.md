Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3229:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of Role Based Access Control (RBAC) within the Cisco IOS XE Web Management Software's administration GUI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper RBAC implementation in the web UI.
- Failure to properly validate the privileges of a user when processing HTTP requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker with "Read-Only" privileges can execute commands and configuration changes as an "Admin" user. This leads to a privilege escalation.
- This includes the ability to execute arbitrary CLI commands and make unauthorized configurations.
- This vulnerability can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and via network access.
- Attackers exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to the affected device's web UI.
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with "Read-Only" access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device.
- Attacker must have valid "Read-Only" user credentials for the web UI.
- The HTTP Server feature must be enabled on the device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is not exploitable if `ip http active-session-modules none` is configured when using HTTP or `ip http secure-active-session-modules none` is configured when using HTTPS.
- No workarounds are available besides disabling the HTTP server feature.
- The advisory lists affected software versions and provides links to Cisco's software checker to assist in identifying vulnerable systems.
