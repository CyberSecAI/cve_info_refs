Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-3197:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient protection mechanisms for Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) server credentials within the Cisco Meetings App's API subsystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Lack of proper security measures to protect TURN server credentials.
-  The application does not ensure expiration or proper handling of these credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain TURN server credentials by intercepting legitimate traffic.
- With these credentials, an attacker can place audio/video calls and forward packets through the compromised TURN server.
- The attacker could potentially use the same credentials across multiple systems. However, they cannot directly take control of the TURN server itself unless the same credentials are used in multiple systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- Interception of legitimate network traffic generated by an affected Cisco Meetings App system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic.
- No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability

**Summary of Changes**
The CSAF document provides a more structured description of the vulnerability and includes details such as acknowledgments, affected products, fixed releases, and remediation information. The initial advisory document provides more human-readable text, but the CSAF format makes the information machine-readable.
