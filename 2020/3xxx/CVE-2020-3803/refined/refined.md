Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-3803:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure library loading (DLL hijacking)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to DLL hijacking, where a malicious DLL can be loaded instead of a legitimate one.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation, as the attacker can execute code with the privileges of the application loading the hijacked DLL.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL with the same name as a legitimate one that the application attempts to load in a location where the application will find it first (e.g., the current working directory).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have write access to a location where the application searches for DLLs before it finds the legitimate one, or be able to control the application's working directory.
