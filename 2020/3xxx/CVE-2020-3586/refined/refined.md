Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-3586:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface of Cisco DNA Spaces Connector.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Command Injection (CWE-78)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary command execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the affected device.
*   **Privilege escalation:** The commands are executed with the privileges of the web-based management application, although running as a restricted user, allowing for potentially unauthorized actions.
*   **Integrity and Availability impact:**  Changes can be made to the pages served by the web-based management application, which could affect its integrity and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
*   **Network:** Attackers send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web-based management interface.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the affected device's web-based management interface.
*   The attacker does not need any privileges or authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker can be remote.

**Summary of Vulnerability**

The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation in the web-based management interface of the Cisco DNA Spaces Connector. This allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to inject commands into the underlying operating system via crafted HTTP requests. Successful exploitation results in the attacker gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code with the limited privileges of the web application, potentially compromising the integrity and availability of the management interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco DNA Spaces Connector software releases 2.2 and earlier.
*   There are no workarounds available.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability in release 2.3 and later.
*   The CVSS score is 9.4, which is considered critical.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
