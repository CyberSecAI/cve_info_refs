Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-3604:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the length of user-supplied data within the parsing of Advanced Recording Format (ARF) files by the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player. Specifically, the software fails to properly validate the length of data before copying it into a fixed-size stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability (CWE-119)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the targeted system, with the privileges of the user who opened the malicious file. This allows the attacker to gain control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a user a malicious ARF file via a link or email attachment.
- The user must then be persuaded to open this malicious file using a vulnerable version of Cisco Webex Network Recording Player on their local system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious ARF file containing oversized data.
- The attacker needs to deliver this file to the victim and persuade them to open it.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Windows.
- This vulnerability only affects Cisco Webex Meetings 40.6.x and 40.7.x sites and earlier.
- There are no workarounds available. Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability was reported by Francis Provencher (PRL) working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- The ZDI assigned identifier ZDI-20-1363 / ZDI-CAN-11175 for this vulnerability.
