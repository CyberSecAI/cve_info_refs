Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-17389

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `decryptFile` method of the `GWTTestServiceImpl` class in Marvell QConvergeConsole.
- The root cause is a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied file path before using it in file operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The lack of proper path validation allows an attacker to manipulate the file path, potentially accessing files outside of the intended directory.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of `SYSTEM`, giving them full control over the affected system.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impact:** The CVSS score of 8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) indicates a high impact on all three security aspects.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable (AV:N)
- **Authentication bypass:** Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.
- **User supplied path:** The vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker manipulating a user-supplied path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected system to send malicious requests.
- **Low Privilege:** The attacker needs low privilege access to the application.

**Additional Details:**
- Marvell has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Marvell on 2020-04-15 and a coordinated public release of advisory occurred on 2020-08-10.
