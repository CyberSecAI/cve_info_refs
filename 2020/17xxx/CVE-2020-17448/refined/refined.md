Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-17448:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Telegram Desktop application (versions 2.1.13 and earlier) did not properly handle files without extensions. This allowed attackers to bypass the application's built-in protection against the execution of dangerous file types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient File Type Validation:** The application relied on file extensions to determine if a file was potentially dangerous. When a file lacked an extension, this check was bypassed.
- **Bypass of Executable Execution Protection:** The vulnerability allowed a malicious executable to be executed by exploiting the lack of extension check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful attack could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the victim's machine, allowing the attacker to potentially take over the system, steal data, or install malware.
- **Information Disclosure:** As mentioned in the Gentoo advisory, information disclosure could also be a consequence of the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Chat Window:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious files with no extensions via the chat window.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to convince the victim to download and click on the malicious file with no extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send Files:** The attacker needs to be able to send files to the victim through Telegram's chat function.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker would have to convince the victim to download and execute the file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Telegram in June 2020 and was patched in version 2.2.
-  The vulnerability is considered low severity and remotely exploitable.

In summary, CVE-2020-17448 in Telegram Desktop allowed attackers to bypass the dangerous file type execution protection by sending files without extensions, which led to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
