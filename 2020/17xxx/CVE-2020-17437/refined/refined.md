  "additional_notes": "This vulnerability is part of the AMNESIA:33 set of vulnerabilities found in multiple open-source TCP/IP stacks commonly used in IoT and embedded devices. The Forescout advisory provides more technical details and a detector tool for identifying vulnerable software. This document lists multiple vendors and their affected products, along with recommendations to apply updates or use workarounds. The impact can include denial of service, disclosure of private information or arbitrary code execution."
