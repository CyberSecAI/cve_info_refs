Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-17482

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the PowerDNS Authoritative Server's improper handling of certain crafted zone records, leading to the exposure of uninitialized memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  Incomplete input validation of zone records, allowing for the insertion of specially crafted records.
- Failure to initialize memory properly before using it for record processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leak:** An attacker can potentially leak sensitive information present in the uninitialized memory by inserting specially crafted DNS records.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the insertion of crafted records into a zone by an authorized user. This could be via a control panel, REST API, or any other mechanism allowing users to modify zone data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authorized user with the ability to insert or modify zone records. This user could be a customer, an API user, or anyone with sufficient privileges to alter DNS zone data. The attacker cannot exploit this through AXFR.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered to have a low severity, because it is an information leak and requires an authorized user.
- The vulnerability affects PowerDNS Authoritative Server versions up to and including 4.3.0.
- Fixed versions are 4.3.1 and up, 4.2.3 and up, and 4.1.14 and up.
- The advisory recommends not taking zone data from untrusted users as a workaround, and upgrading to a fixed version as the solution.
