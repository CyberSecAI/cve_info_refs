  "Content": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in Foxit Studio Photo related to CR2 file parsing, along with a variety of security updates for other Foxit products. However, the content directly pertaining to CVE-2020-17430 is:\n\n**Content from www.zerodayinitiative.com_6e3ab680_20250119_130310.html:**\n\n## Foxit Studio Photo CR2 File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n### ZDI-20-1341ZDI-CAN-11332\n\n| CVE ID | [CVE-2020-17430](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-17430) |\n| --- | --- |\n| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |\n| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Foxit](https://www.foxitsoftware.com/) |\n| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Studio Photo |\n| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit Studio Photo. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of CR2 files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |\n| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Foxit has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |\n| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2020-06-24 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2020-10-28 - Coordinated public release of advisory |\n| CREDIT | Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative |\n",
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of CR2 files. This lack of validation allows for a write past the end of an allocated structure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds write"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Visiting a malicious page",
    "Opening a malicious file"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious page or file containing a specially crafted CR2 file. User interaction is needed as the victim has to visit the malicious page or open the malicious file."
