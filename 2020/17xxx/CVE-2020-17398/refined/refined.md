Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-17398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `prl_hypervisor` kext (kernel extension) in Parallels Desktop. This insufficient validation allows for a read operation beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to inadequate input validation.
- Information disclosure: Successful exploitation results in the disclosure of potentially sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can read data from memory locations outside the intended buffer, potentially revealing sensitive information.
- Potential for further exploitation: The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution in the kernel context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack: The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system.
- Low-privilege access: The attacker can exploit this with low-privileged code execution capabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the system: The attacker must be able to execute code on the system where Parallels Desktop is installed.
- Ability to execute low-privileged code: The attacker needs to be able to execute code with limited privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
