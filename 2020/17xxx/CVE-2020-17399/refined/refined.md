Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-17399

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `prl_hypervisor` kext (kernel extension) in Parallels Desktop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The insufficient validation allows an attacker to write data beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges and execute code within the kernel's context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute code with low privileges on the system. This could be achieved through other vulnerabilities or by legitimate access to the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Parallels Desktop.
- Parallels has released an update to address this issue.
