The provided content does not contain information related to CVE-2020-17361. However, it does describe vulnerabilities in Noise-Java, specifically:

**CVE-2020-25021:**
- **Root cause:** Insufficient boundary checks in `ChaChaPolyCipherState.encryptWithAd()`.
- **Weaknesses:** Missing checks for `plaintextOffset` and negative values for `ciphertextOffset` and `length`, allowing out-of-bounds read/write via `System.arraycopy`
- **Impact:** Out-of-bounds read/write, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, memory disclosure, denial of service, or data loss. May also result in a JVM exception.
- **Attack vector:** Passing large `plaintextOffset`, negative `ciphertextOffset`, or negative `length` values to the `encryptWithAd()` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to control the arguments passed to the `encryptWithAd()` method.

**CVE-2020-25022:**
- **Root cause:** Insufficient boundary checks in `AESGCMFallbackCipherState.encryptWithAd()`.
- **Weaknesses:** Similar to CVE-2020-25021, missing checks for `plaintextOffset` and negative values for `ciphertextOffset` and `length`, leading to out-of-bounds read/write via `System.arraycopy`.
- **Impact:** Same as CVE-2020-25021: Out-of-bounds read/write, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, memory disclosure, denial of service, or data loss. May also result in a JVM exception.
- **Attack vector:** Passing large `plaintextOffset`, negative `ciphertextOffset`, or negative `length` values to the `encryptWithAd()` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to control the arguments passed to the `encryptWithAd()` method.

**CVE-2020-25023:**
- **Root cause:** Insufficient boundary checks in `AESGCMOnCtrCipherState.encryptWithAd()`.
- **Weaknesses:** Similar to the other two, missing checks for `plaintextOffset` and negative values for `ciphertextOffset` and `length`, leading to out-of-bounds read/write via `System.arraycopy` or underlying methods.
- **Impact:** Same as CVE-2020-25021 and CVE-2020-25022: Out-of-bounds read/write, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, memory disclosure, denial of service, or data loss. May also result in a JVM exception.
- **Attack vector:** Passing large `plaintextOffset`, negative `ciphertextOffset`, or negative `length` values to the `encryptWithAd()` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to control the arguments passed to the `encryptWithAd()` method.

The content also mentions that exploitation may depend on the specific JVM in use, with some JVMs (like Avian) being more vulnerable to OOB read/write than others, which might throw exceptions instead.
