- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ZKBiosecurity Server lacks proper client authentication, relying solely on a long-lasting token for API access. This allows an attacker to reuse a valid token obtained from network sniffing to send arbitrary commands to the server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):** The server does not properly validate the privileges of the user making the API requests.
    - **Token Reuse:**  The long-lasting token used for authentication is vulnerable to reuse by attackers once obtained through network sniffing.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Unauthorized User Creation:** An attacker can create new arbitrary users on the system.
    - **User Impersonation:**  An attacker can upload a new picture to associate with an account, effectively allowing them to bypass biometric authentication.
    - **Account Deletion:** An attacker can delete user accounts.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can elevate the privileges of an existing user to administrator.
    - **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can download user face data from the database.
    - **Device Compromise:** By gaining admin privileges, attackers can configure the FaceDepot tablet, install APKs via USB, and switch to other apps.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - **Network Sniffing:** The attacker must sniff network traffic to obtain a valid authentication token used by a legitimate FaceDepot device.
    - **API Manipulation:** Attackers use HTTP POST requests with the captured token to send malicious API commands to the ZKBiosecurity Server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - **LAN Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same local area network (LAN) as the ZKBiosecurity server and the FaceDepot devices.
    - **Network Sniffing Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to capture network traffic to obtain a valid authentication token.
    - **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP GET/POST requests to the server using tools like cURL.
