{
  "CVE-2020-17445": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The function in picoTCP-NG and picoTCP that processes the IPv6 destination options extension header does not check the validity of its options lengths, allowing an attacker to corrupt memory and/or put the function into an infinite loop with crafted length values.",
    "root_cause": "The IPv6 destination options extension header processing function in picoTCP-NG and picoTCP lacks proper validation of option lengths.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds Read",
        "Memory Corruption",
      "Infinite Loop"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trigger a memory corruption and/or cause the affected device to enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted IPv6 packets with destination option extension headers with malicious length values.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device. A low skill level is needed to exploit."
