Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how GNOME Shell handles the password dialog on the login screen during user logout. The password field is not cleared properly when a user logs out, causing the previously entered password (or its length) to be briefly visible when the login dialog reappears.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the unintended exposure of the user's password or its length, even if momentarily. This occurs because the password field is not reset or cleared upon logout.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised Confidentiality:** If an attacker is physically present and observes the screen during logout, they could potentially gain access to the user's password. Even if only the length of the password is shown, this still reduces the password's secrecy.
*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** While the exploit itself does not directly escalate privileges, gaining a user's password can lead to subsequent privilege escalation if an attacker uses the compromised credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attack vector relies on physical access to the system. An attacker needs to be physically present at the computer and observe the screen when the user logs out.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Proximity:** The attacker needs to be close enough to the computer screen to observe the brief display of the password during the logout process.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs specifically in the GNOME Shell's login dialog.
*   The issue is present in GNOME 3.34 and 3.36 (and possibly other versions).
*   The password visibility is a direct consequence of the dialog not being properly reset upon logout.
*  The fix involves resetting the authentication prompt on VT switch before the fade-in in `js/gdm/loginDialog.js`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered a "low" severity issue by Gentoo.
*   Ubuntu has released a patch for this issue (gnome-shell 3.36.4-1ubuntu1~20.04.2 for Ubuntu 20.04).
*   Debian also addressed this issue in their LTS release (gnome-shell 3.22.3-3+deb9u1 for Debian 9).
