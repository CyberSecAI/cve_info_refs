    "is_related": true,
    "summary": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit Studio Photo. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of CR2 files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CR2 files, which leads to a write past the end of an allocated memory structure.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds write"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.",

        "Visiting a malicious webpage.",
        "Opening a malicious file."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to craft a malicious CR2 file or a website that embeds a malicious CR2 file. Requires user interaction (opening a malicious file/visiting a malicious page)."
