Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-17451:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the flatCore CMS's administrative panel, allowing an authenticated admin user to inject malicious client-side scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability lies in the ability to inject and store malicious JavaScript code within various page content fields. This code is then executed when other users (including other admins or visitors, depending on where the injected code is displayed) view the affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** When a user visits a page containing the injected XSS payload, the JavaScript code is executed within their browser.
*   **Account Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the victim user and gain access to their account.
*   **Defacement/Redirects:** The attacker can deface the website content, redirect users to other sites, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Information Theft:** The attacker might steal sensitive data, such as login credentials, through injected scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrative privileges to access the vulnerable admin panel.
*   **Injection through Admin Panel:** The attacker must navigate to specific sections within the admin panel (e.g., page editing, system preferences) to inject the XSS payload.
*   **Payload Storage:** The malicious script gets stored within the CMS database and executed when other users view pages containing that stored content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid administrator account on the affected flatCore CMS instance.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the admin panel of the vulnerable flatCore CMS.

**Technical Details:**

The following parameters were found to be vulnerable to XSS:

*   `page_linkname`, `page_title`, `page_content`, `page_extracontent` in `http://$DOMAIN/acp/acp.php?tn=pages&sub=edit&editpage=1` (POST method).
*   `prefs_pagename`, `prefs_pagetitle`, `prefs_pagesubtitle` in `http://$DOMAIN/acp/acp.php?tn=system&sub=sys_pref` (POST method).

The provided proof-of-concept payload is: `aaaa%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`.

**Additional Notes:**
*   This advisory provides more detail than the typical CVE description, such as the specific vulnerable parameters and the attack vector.
*   The advisory specifies that the vulnerability affects flatCore CMS versions 1.5.5 and earlier.
*   The advisory lists the fixed version as 1.5.7.
*   The advisory indicates a second vulnerability, CVE-2020-17452, related to arbitrary file uploads by authenticated users.
