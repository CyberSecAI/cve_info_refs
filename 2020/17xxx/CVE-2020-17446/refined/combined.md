### @Gelbpunkt **[Gelbpunkt](/Gelbpunkt)** commented [Jul 4, 2020](#issue-650922252) ‚Ä¢ edited Loading

This does the following changes:

* Updates the Python versions for the OSX builds to the latest ones
* Removes the version pin on wheel
* setuptools 48.0.0 broke asyncpg, distutils is deprecated now, I've rewrote it to setuptools entirely
* CI pipelines now have names
* aarch64 tests against the latest python and postgresql are now done
* manylinux2014 wheels for aarch64 are also built now
* bumped Ubuntu to focal (20.04)
* bumped Cython to fix compatibility with python 3.10
* CI builds now actually install the built wheel and not the latest pypi release
* version test is skipped for dev builds as the git commit hash mixes up the version number
* resolved all travis config warnings
* postgres 9.2-9.4 are EOL and removed from the tests

The manylinux containers from pypa only work on the architecture they are made for, so a aarch64 manylinux wheel can only be built on aarch64. Therefore, two containers now perform the builds. It might be worth thinking about letting the aarch64 container handle the upload alone for all wheels as it is ages slower than the x86 one anyways.

I've tested pretty much everything except the S3 bucket and pypi push, the wheels themselves get built and the other pipelines pass.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Package        : asyncpg
Version        : 0.8.4-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-17446

asyncpg before 0.21.0 allows a malicious PostgreSQL server to trigger
a crash or execute arbitrary code (on a database client) via a crafted
server response, because of access to an uninitialized pointer in the
array data decoder.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
0.8.4-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your asyncpg packages.

For the detailed security status of asyncpg please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/asyncpg>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
