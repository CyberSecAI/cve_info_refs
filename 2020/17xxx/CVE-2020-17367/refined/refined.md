Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2020-17367:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2020-17367 lies in firejail's improper handling of the end-of-options separator `--` after the `--output` option. This flaw allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands, because the separator was not respected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of the `--` end-of-options separator.
- Command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with control over the command-line arguments of a sandboxed application could write data to a specified file.
- This can lead to arbitrary command execution when combined with another vulnerability (CVE-2020-17368).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through crafted command-line arguments to the `firejail` program.
- Specifically, when using the `--output` option, the lack of proper handling for the end-of-options separator is exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs control over the command-line arguments passed to a firejailed application.
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the arguments of the command being run inside the sandbox.

**Summary of Relevant Information:**
Multiple sources confirm that `firejail` failed to respect the end-of-options separator, `--`, when used after the `--output` option. This could lead to command injection. The vulnerability was addressed in subsequent releases of firejail, and updates were pushed for multiple distributions. This CVE is often linked with CVE-2020-17368, as the two vulnerabilities can be chained to achieve arbitrary code execution.

The provided information offers more detail than the official CVE description by detailing the specific command option (`--output`) involved and describing the end-of-options separator (`--`) that is mishandled.
