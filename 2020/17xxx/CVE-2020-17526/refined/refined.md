Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-17526:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incorrect session validation mechanism in the Apache Airflow webserver when using the default configuration. Specifically, the `secret_key` used for session management is not unique and is the default across all instances.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The vulnerability stems from the usage of a default `secret_key` value for session management. This means that multiple Airflow instances, using the default config, will share the same secret key.
*   **Lack of Session Isolation:** The webserver fails to properly isolate user sessions based on the specific Airflow instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A malicious user who is authenticated on one Airflow webserver instance (Site A) can potentially gain unauthorized access to another Airflow webserver instance (Site B) by using the session from Site A, as both servers use the same secret key. This allows the attacker to bypass authentication and potentially control Site B.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Session Reuse:** The attacker logs into an Airflow instance (Site A) and then attempts to reuse their session on a different Airflow instance (Site B), which uses the same default secret key.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability affects the Airflow webserver, making the web interface the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user with an active session on at least one vulnerable Airflow instance using the default secret key.
*   **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to be aware of the existence of other vulnerable Airflow instances also using the default secret key.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to both the source Airflow instance they are logged into and the target Airflow instance they wish to access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to versions of Apache Airflow prior to 1.10.14.
*   The vulnerability is mitigated by changing the default `secret_key` value in the `[webserver]` configuration section.
*   The information provided is more detailed than the placeholder description in the original CVE.
