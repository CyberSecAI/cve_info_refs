The provided content is related to CVE-2020-17473.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of mutual authentication in ZKTeco FaceDepot 7B 1.0.213 and ZKBiosecurity Server 1.0.0_20190723. This allows an attacker to impersonate the server and obtain a long-lasting token.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of mutual authentication
- Insufficient Session Expiration (CWE-613)
- Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295)
- Lack of CSRF protection
- Long-lived tokens

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Obtain long-lasting tokens
- Replay attacks
- Command forgery
- Arbitrary user addition
- Privilege escalation (related to CVE-2020-17474)

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker who can sniff network traffic or perform ARP spoofing to impersonate the server can exploit the vulnerability. The attacker can intercept or manipulate network communication between the ZKTeco FaceDepot 7B and the ZKBiosecurity Server to steal access tokens.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable devices and be able to intercept or manipulate network traffic. The attacker needs to be able to either sniff the network traffic or perform ARP spoofing and simulate the ZKBiosecurity Server.
