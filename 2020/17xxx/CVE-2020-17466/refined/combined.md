## [How does TRCwifiZone Work?](#How does TRCwifiZone Work?)

After user writes the address of the web site he desires to access through a browser supporting device, user is forwarded to welcoming screen (completely changeable). User may use the system through any browser supporting device. System forwards the user to a customizable welcoming screen upon the first web request generated. Welcoming screen asks the user to perform identity authentication. Three different scenarios might be applied at this stage.

- System might communicate with an Active Directory defined beforehand and involve the user into authentication process.

- User may sign up the system through a simple instruction on welcoming screen and receive verification password details by SMS.

- User might be created manually by the administrator or administrators from an individual administration screen.

**Logging in System / Signing Up**

- Manuel Users

After the user enters the user name and password he receives earlier, the information is checked and user is allowed/not allowed to access internet in line with accuracy of the information.

- Active Directory Users

After the user enters the user name and password he receives earlier, the information is checked and user is allowed/not allowed to access internet in line with accuracy of the information.

- By Sms Verification

- User fills in the information fields as asked from him by the system by clicking on "new user registry" on welcoming screen. "Verification Code" is sent to the cell phone number (independent of operator) entered during sign up for verifying the account and user is directed to "Account Activation" page.

User writes the "Verification Code" sent to his cell phone and his cell phone number in the relevant fields and verifies his account. User is directed to home page following this procedure.

After the user enters the user name and password sent to his cell phone, the information is checked and user is allowed/not allowed to access internet in line with accuracy of the information.

All procedures of the user particularly ip-mac, url address are logged pursuant to law no 5651 once user is given internet access permission and content filtering procedures are carried out.
