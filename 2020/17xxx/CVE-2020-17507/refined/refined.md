{
  "CVE-2020-17507": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Qt through 5.12.9, and 5.13.x through 5.15.x before 5.15.1. read_xbm_body in gui/image/qxbmhandler.cpp has a buffer over-read.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The XBM parser in Qt does not properly validate the size of the input data, leading to a buffer over-read when parsing crafted XBM files.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer over-read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A buffer over-read can lead to a crash, denial-of-service, and potentially arbitrary code execution if an attacker can craft an input that overwrites critical memory regions.",
      "Attack vectors": [
          "Processing a specially crafted XBM image file.",
           "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely or locally."
        ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to supply a crafted XBM image to an application that uses a vulnerable version of the Qt library. No specific privilege or position is required."
