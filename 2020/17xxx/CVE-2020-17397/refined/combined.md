# Advisory Details

August 18th, 2020
## Parallels Desktop Networking Out-Of-Bounds Access Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-20-1015ZDI-CAN-11253

| CVE ID | [CVE-2020-17397](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-17397) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.5, [AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Parallels |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Desktop |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Desktop. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of network packets. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the hypervisor. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Parallels has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

Like any software development company, Parallels does not disclose, confirm or discuss security vulnerabilities until they are fixed, and the fix has been released to the public.

If you believe you have found a security issue in Parallels Desktop, visit [KB 125214.](https://kb.parallels.com/125214)

## Get the latest Parallels Desktop update

To maintain your Parallels Desktop product's security, we recommend installing all available product updates. To learn how to check for updates, visit [KB 111603](https://kb.parallels.com/111603).

## Importance of installing macOS security updates

Parallels Desktop takes the best of both worlds—Mac and Windows—to provide users with the best experience in both operating systems, including your security. To keep your virtual machine (VM) safe, after installing the latest Parallels Desktop build we also strongly recommend installing all macOS security updates. Parallels Desktop depends on the security of macOS, as it runs on a Mac under control from macOS. For your convenience, you can even [automate macOS updates](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207005) or perform them [manually](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541).

---

## Importance of installing Windows security updates

After installing the latest Parallels Desktop build and all macOS security updates take care of the last part, your virtual machine. Because Parallels Desktop precisely emulates Windows, the safety of your Windows VM is dependent on the safety of Windows itself. To keep Windows safe, install all Windows updates including security fixes. [Check this article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-10-update) to learn how to update.

## Parallels Desktop for Mac App Store Edition security updates

As any application installed from App Store, Parallels Desktop for Mac App Store Edition runs in a [sandbox environment](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AboutAppSandbox/AboutAppSandbox.html) where all access to your data is limited. Furthermore, the App Store edition uses Apple hypervisor to run virtual machines, thus relying on the overall security of macOS. The safety of your VM while using the App Store edition depends solely on the security of macOS and Windows. As recommended above, install all security updates for macOS (including any related to the App Store application) and Windows to keep your VM safe.
