Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-17487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how `radare2` parses signature information within Portable Executable (PE) files. Specifically, it mishandles malformed Object Identifiers (OIDs) within the `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_SECURITY` structure.
*   The function `r_x509_parse_algorithmidentifier` in `libr/util/x509.c` does not properly handle cases where the OID tag is not `TAG_OID` (0x6). This leads to `ai->algorithm` remaining NULL.
*   Later, when `strdup` is called on `bin->spcinfo->messageDigest.digestAlgorithm.algorithm->string` in `Pe32_bin_pe_compute_authentihash`, it causes a segmentation fault due to dereferencing the null pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a null pointer dereference due to incorrect OID parsing, leading to `ai->algorithm` being null.
*   **Improper Input Validation/Handling:** The code does not adequately validate the structure of the `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_SECURITY` before processing it, specifically the OID tag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability causes `radare2` to crash due to a segmentation fault, effectively leading to a denial of service. Attackers can craft a malicious PE file that triggers the crash when opened by `radare2`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PE File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted PE file that contains a malformed `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_SECURITY` structure with a non-standard OID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft PE Files:** An attacker needs the ability to create or modify a PE file and manipulate the `IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_SECURITY` structure to include an incorrect OID value.
*   **Victim Uses radare2 to Analyze:** The victim must then attempt to open this crafted PE file using `radare2` to trigger the crash.

**Additional Information:**

*   A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) script was created to demonstrate the vulnerability by modifying the OID.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple architectures and operating systems where `radare2` is used.
*   The issue was fixed in radare2 version 5.1.1
*   The vulnerability is tracked in Red Hat Bugzilla as issue #1869623

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
