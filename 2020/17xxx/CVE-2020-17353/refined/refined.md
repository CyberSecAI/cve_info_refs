Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2020-17353:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The LilyPond music typesetting system, when run with the `-dsafe` command-line option, does not properly restrict the use of embedded PostScript (`embedded-ps`) and SVG (`embedded-svg`) commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `-dsafe` option is intended to limit potentially unsafe operations. However, the lack of restrictions on `embedded-ps` and `embedded-svg` allows for the inclusion of malicious PostScript or SVG code.
- **Code Injection:** By embedding malicious code within a LilyPond input file, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary PostScript code during the rendering process, bypassing the intended security restrictions of the `-dsafe` option.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system where LilyPond is running.
- **System Compromise:** Arbitrary code execution can lead to various malicious activities, including data theft, system manipulation, and the installation of backdoors.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious LilyPond Input Files:** An attacker crafts a specially designed LilyPond input file that contains malicious PostScript or SVG code within the `embedded-ps` or `embedded-svg` commands.
- **User Interaction:** The user must process the malicious LilyPond file using the vulnerable version of LilyPond with the `-dsafe` option for the exploit to be triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify LilyPond input files.
- The attacker must entice the victim to process the malicious file using Lilypond with the `-dsafe` command line option

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `-dsafe` option is used, indicating that it's a bypass of an intended security measure.
- Multiple Linux distributions were affected, including openSUSE, Fedora, and Debian.
- Patches were made available and released to fix the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was considered to have "moderate" to "major" severity by various distributions.
