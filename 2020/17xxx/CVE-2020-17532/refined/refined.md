**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending malicious YAML data to the vulnerable service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the service.
- The `handler-router` component must be enabled for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Affected Versions:**
- Apache ServiceComb Java Chassis versions between 2.0.0 and 2.1.3 (inclusive) are vulnerable.

**Patched Versions:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Apache ServiceComb Java Chassis versions 2.1.5 and 1.3.2.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is tracked as SCB-2145 in the Apache Jira instance.
- Patches were delivered via GitHub Pull Requests #2102 and #2103.
