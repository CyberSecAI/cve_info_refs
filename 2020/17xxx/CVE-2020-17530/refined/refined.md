{
  "CVE-2020-17530": {
    "description": "Forced OGNL evaluation, when evaluated on raw user input in tag attributes, may lead to remote code execution - similar toÂ S2-059.",
    "root_cause": "Some of the tag's attributes could perform a double evaluation if a developer applied forced OGNL evaluation by using the `%{...}`syntax. Using forced OGNL evaluation on untrusted user input can lead to a Remote Code Execution and security degradation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Double evaluation of tag attributes due to forced OGNL evaluation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Tag attributes with forced OGNL evaluation (%{...}) containing untrusted user input"
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must be able to supply malicious user input that is then used in forced OGNL evaluation in tag's attributes"
  }
