    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2020-17456",
      "root_cause": "The Seowon SLR-120 router is vulnerable to remote code execution due to insufficient input validation in the `system_log.cgi` script, allowing an attacker to inject commands into the `pingIpAddr` parameter.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Command Injection",
        "Insufficient Input Validation",
        "Unauthenticated access"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router with root privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/system_log.cgi`",
        "Malicious command injection via `pingIpAddr` parameter"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs network access to the router, no authentication is required.",
      "additional_information": "The exploit code sends a POST request to `/cgi-bin/system_log.cgi` with a modified `pingIpAddr` parameter to inject and execute commands. The script sends a command appended to a ping command using a semicolon (`;`). This allows for multiple commands to be executed in a chain. The exploit is not limited to a specific version of the router."
