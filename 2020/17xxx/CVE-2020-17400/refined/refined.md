Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2020-17400:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `prl_hypervisor` kext (kernel extension). This inadequate validation leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary weakness is that the software attempts to read memory beyond the allocated buffer due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate their privileges and execute code within the context of the hypervisor. This allows for potentially complete control over the virtualized environment and possibly the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack requires the attacker to already have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have gained a foothold on the system, having the capability to run low-privileged code. This could be achieved through various means like exploiting another vulnerability or social engineering.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `prl_hypervisor` kernel extension of Parallels Desktop.
- Parallels has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-07-01 and publicly disclosed on 2020-08-18.
- The ZDI identifier for this vulnerability is ZDI-20-1018 and ZDI-CAN-11304
- The CVSS score is 8.8 with a vector string of AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.
