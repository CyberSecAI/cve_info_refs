Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-17391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the exposure of a dangerous method or function to an unprivileged user within the handler for `HOST_IOCTL_INIT_HYPERVISOR` in the `prl_hypervisor` kext (kernel extension) of Parallels Desktop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The primary vulnerability is the ability to disclose information due to the exposure of a dangerous method to unprivileged users.
- Insecure method handling: The `HOST_IOCTL_INIT_HYPERVISOR` handler in the `prl_hypervisor` kext is mishandling access control allowing unprivileged users to access privileged functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: A local attacker can leverage this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive information about the system that is normally protected.
- Potential Kernel Code Execution: The advisory mentions that an attacker could leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel, implying a possible privilege escalation if chained with other exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local Code Execution: The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- User context: The attacker must be a local user with low privileges.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Parallels on April 1, 2020, and publicly disclosed on August 18, 2020.
- Parallels has released an update to fix this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-20-1009/ZDI-CAN-10518.
- The CVSS score is 6.5 with the vector `AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N`, indicating a local attack with low privileges required and high confidentiality impact.
