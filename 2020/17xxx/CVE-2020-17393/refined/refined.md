Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-17393:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation within the `prl_hypervisor` kernel extension (kext). Specifically, user-supplied data is not adequately checked, which can lead to a pointer being leaked after a handler finishes processing the data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is the failure to validate user-supplied data before processing it within the `prl_hypervisor` kext.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The improper input validation leads to a pointer leak, which could reveal sensitive information from the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to disclose kernel information.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** The advisory mentions that the leaked information can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to potentially achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the kernel. However, this CVE itself does not directly cause arbitrary code execution; rather, it is a step towards it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack is local, requiring the attacker to already have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
*   **prl_hypervisor KEXT:** The vulnerability exists in the `prl_hypervisor` kext, implying that the attacker needs to interact with this kernel extension by providing malicious input through its interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privileged Code Execution:** The attacker must first have the capability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. This means they've already gained some level of access, but it's not necessarily root/admin privileges.
*   **Interaction with prl_hypervisor KEXT:** The attacker needs to be able to supply crafted input to the vulnerable `prl_hypervisor` kext.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-04-01.
*   A fix was released by Parallels, with advisory made public on 2020-08-18.
* The ZDI-CAN identifier for this vulnerability is ZDI-CAN-10520
* The fix for this vulnerability was included in Parallels Desktop version 15.1.4 (47270) released on April 21, 2020.
