Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-17401:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the VGA virtual device within Parallels Desktop.
- It stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This results in a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software reads data past the end of a buffer.
- Insufficient input validation: User-supplied data is not adequately checked before being used in memory operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to disclose sensitive information from the affected Parallels Desktop installation.
- Privilege Escalation: An attacker can potentially combine this vulnerability with others to escalate their privileges and execute code within the context of the hypervisor.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs to have local access to the guest system to exploit the vulnerability.
- High Privileges: The attacker needs to first gain the ability to execute high-privileged code within the guest system to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system.
- The attacker needs to be able to supply data that triggers the out-of-bounds read within the virtual VGA device.

**Additional Details:**
- Parallels has released an update to patch the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Parallels on 2020-07-15, and the advisory was publicly released on 2020-08-18.
- The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS score of 6.0 with the vector string AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating a local attack vector, low attack complexity, requirement for high privileges, no user interaction, a scope change, and a high confidentiality impact with no integrity or availability impact.
- The vulnerability was discovered by grigoritchy.
