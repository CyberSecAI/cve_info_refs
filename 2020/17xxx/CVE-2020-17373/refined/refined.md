{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "User input passed through the encoded “current_post” parameter to ‘index.php’ (when “entryPoint” is set to “export” and “module” is set to “Reports”) is not properly sanitized before being used to construct a SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can read sensitive data from the database through time-based SQL Injection attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted request to the 'index.php' endpoint with the 'entryPoint' parameter set to 'export', 'module' set to 'Reports', and a malicious SQL payload in the 'current_post' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable SugarCRM instance."
