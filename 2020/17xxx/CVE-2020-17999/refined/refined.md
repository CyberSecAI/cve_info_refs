- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `post-edit.php` file which echoes the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` directly into the HTML output without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The script is vulnerable because it reflects unsanitized user input from the request URI back to the user's browser.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `REQUEST_URI`, which will then be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page. This allows the attacker to potentially steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the user's session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the URL query string. An attacker crafts a malicious URL with the payload injected into a query parameter, which is reflected on the page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into visiting the URL while logged into the MiniCMS. No other specific capabilities are needed beyond access to the URL.
