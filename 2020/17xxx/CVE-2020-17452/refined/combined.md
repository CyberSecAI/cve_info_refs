flatCore CMS suffers from multiple vulnerabilities including stored cross site scripting and arbitrary file upload. The edit content panel of flatCore allows authenticated users to inject malicious client side script which leads to stored cross site scripting. Additionally, arbitrary files such as web shells can be uploaded to the server due to the insufficient file upload validation which leads to a full system compromise.

## Vendor Description

*“flatCore is based on PHP and PDO/SQLite. The Core is as minimalistic as possible, but can be easily extended by the modular structure. If you are looking for a solution to edit your website live and with ease, flatCore may be your buddy.”*

Source: <https://flatcore.org/>

## Business Recommendation

Update to the latest version of flatCore CMS. An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is highly advised, as the software may be affected from further security issues.

## Vulnerability Overview / Description

### 1. Stored Cross Site Scripting (Authenticated user) – CVE-2020-17451

This vulnerability allows an authenticated user (admin) to inject a malicious client side script which will be executed in the browser of a user if he visits the manipulated URL. In this case, the payload will be executed when the user visits any page that contains the injected malicious client side script.

### 2. Upload of arbitrary files (Authenticated user) – CVE-2020-17452

It was identified that an authenticated user (admin) has the possibility to upload malicious files without any restriction. In this specific case, arbitrary server side PHP code such as web shells can be uploaded. As a result the attacker can run arbitrary code on the server side with the privileges of the web server. This could lead to a full system compromise.

## Proof Of Concept

### 1. Stored Cross Site Scripting (Authenticated user)

The following parameters have been found to be vulnerable to stored cross site scripting attacks.

a)

***URL : [$DOMAIN/acp/acp.php](http://$DOMAIN/acp/acp.php?tn=pages&amp;sub=edit&amp;editpage=1) METHOD : POST PARAMETER : page\_linkname, page\_title, page\_content, page\_extracontent PAYLOAD : aaaa%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C%2Fscript%3E***

Go to ***[$DOMAIN](http://$DOMAIN/)*** and the XSS will be executed.

b)

***URL : [$DOMAIN/acp/acp.php](http://$DOMAIN/acp/acp.php?tn=system&amp;sub=sys_pref) METHOD : POST PARAMETER : prefs\_pagename, prefs\_pagetitle, prefs\_pagesubtitle PAYLOAD : aaaa%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C%2Fscript%3E***

Go to ***[$DOMAIN](http://$DOMAIN/)*** and the XSS will be executed.

### 2. Upload of arbitrary files (Authenticated user)

Go to ***Upload Files > Choose destination > files***. Upload a desired PHP web shell as the ***shell.php*** file. Once uploaded, to execute the webshell, go to ***[$DOMAIN/content/files/shell.php](http://$DOMAIN/content/files/shell.php)***

## Vulnerable / Tested Versions

flatCore CMS version 1.5.5 has been tested, which was the latest version available at the time of the test. Previous versions may also be affected.
