Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2020-17521:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content from `security.netapp.com_5d1b3833_20250119_140552.html` directly references "CVE-2020-17521 Apache Groovy Vulnerability in NetApp Products".
*   The content from `groovy-lang.org_bcc133c2_20250119_122757.html` contains a section explicitly detailing "CVE-2020-17521 Apache Groovy Information Disclosure".

Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT** to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Apache Groovy creates temporary directories on Unix-like systems and older versions of Mac OSX and Windows. Groovy uses a JDK method now considered unsuitable for security-sensitive contexts and does not check a flag related to the successful creation of temporary directories, leading to a race condition. This vulnerability is triggered when user code employs Groovy's extension methods for creating temporary directories, potentially storing sensitive information or executable code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Temporary Directory Creation:** Groovy creates temporary directories within the operating system's shared temporary directory, which can be accessible by other users. The use of an insecure JDK method and the lack of a check for successful creation of temporary directories creates a race condition.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information could be exposed or modified if it is stored within the insecurely created temporary directories.
    *  **Local Privilege Escalation:** If executable code is stored in a temporary directory created with these extension methods, it could lead to privilege escalation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker might gain access to sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) if such data is stored in the shared temporary directory.
    *  **Local Privilege Escalation**:  If the temporary directory contains executable code, an attacker may be able to execute that code with the privileges of the user who created the directory.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector involves exploiting Groovy's temporary directory creation methods on vulnerable operating systems, where temporary directories are created in a shared location.
    * The vulnerability is triggered when Groovy user code uses the affected extension methods to create temporary directories and stores sensitive data or executable code in them.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have local access to a machine running vulnerable Groovy code.
    * The attacker needs to be another user of the system.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Groovy Versions:**
    *   Unsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from 2.0 to 2.4.3.
    *   Apache Groovy versions 2.4.4 to 2.4.20, 2.5.0 to 2.5.13, 3.0.0 to 3.0.6, and 4.0.0-alpha-1.
*   **Fixed Groovy Versions:**
    *   2.4.21, 2.5.14, 3.0.7, 4.0.0-alpha-2
*  **NetApp Affected Products:**
    * SnapCenter
*  **NetApp Workaround:**
    * Set the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user.
*   **NetApp Remediation:**
    *   Upgrade to the fixed version of SnapCenter to resolve the vulnerability.
*   **NetApp Products Not Affected:** NetApp has identified a list of products that are not affected. These include, but are not limited to: 7-Mode Transition Tool, several controllers (AFF, ATTO, E-Series, NetApp HCI), Active IQ Unified Manager, Brocade Fabric OS,  Cloud Manager, Clustered Data ONTAP, etc.

**4. Summary of Information:**

The vulnerability allows for a local attacker to potentially disclose sensitive information, modify data, or elevate privileges by exploiting the way Groovy creates temporary directories on vulnerable systems. The vulnerability is caused by insecure usage of JDK methods for creating temporary directories combined with lack of proper checking for successful creation of the temporary directory and insufficient directory permissions.

The vulnerability is exploitable by local users on operating systems that create temporary directories in a shared space. The vulnerability can be mitigated by using a separate temporary directory, but the best solution is upgrading to a patched version of Groovy.
NetApp specifically identifies SnapCenter as an affected product, and provides the corresponding patch.
