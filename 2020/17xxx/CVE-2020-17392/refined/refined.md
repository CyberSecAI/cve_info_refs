Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-17392:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `prl_hypervisor` kext (kernel extension) within Parallels Desktop.
- Specifically, the issue is within the handler for `HOST_IOCTL_SET_KERNEL_SYMBOLS`.
- The root cause is a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value before it is dereferenced as a pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Untrusted Pointer Dereference:** The core weakness is that the application directly uses a user-controlled value as a memory address (pointer) without verifying if it's a valid address. This allows the attacker to control where the program reads/writes.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The user-supplied value is not checked before being used as a pointer, thus a malicious address can be provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges to the level of the kernel.
- **Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel, leading to complete system control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **User-Supplied Value:** The attacker provides a crafted value through the `HOST_IOCTL_SET_KERNEL_SYMBOLS` handler, which will then be used as an address by the kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privilege Code Execution:** The attacker needs to have a foothold on the system, allowing them to execute code with low privileges.
- **Interaction with vulnerable API:** The attacker must be able to interact with `HOST_IOCTL_SET_KERNEL_SYMBOLS` handler.

**Additional Details:**
- Parallels released a fix in version 16.0.0 (48916) to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-04-01.
