Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2020-17406:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied input before it's used in a system call. Specifically, the `ping` parameter provided to `tools.sh` is not sanitized, allowing for command injection.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected device.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack is remote, targeting the `ping` parameter in `tools.sh`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, which implies they need valid user credentials on the affected device.
