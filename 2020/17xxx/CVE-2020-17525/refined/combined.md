Package        : subversion
Version        : 1.9.5-1+deb9u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-17525

One security issue has been discovered in subversion:

CVE-2020-17525:

    Subversion's mod_authz_svn module will crash if the server is using
    in-repository authz rules with the AuthzSVNReposRelativeAccessFile
    option and a client sends a request for a non-existing repository URL.
    This can lead to disruption for users of the service.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
1.9.5-1+deb9u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.

For the detailed security status of subversion please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/subversion>

Remote unauthenticated denial-of-service in Subversion mod\_authz\_svn.
Summary:
========
Subversion's mod\_authz\_svn module will crash if the server is using
in-repository authz rules with the AuthzSVNReposRelativeAccessFile
option and a client sends a request for a non-existing repository URL.
This can lead to disruption for users of the service.
Known vulnerable:
=================
mod\_dav\_svn+mod\_authz\_svn servers 1.9.0 through 1.10.6 (inclusive).
mod\_dav\_svn+mod\_authz\_svn servers 1.11.0 through 1.14.0 (inclusive).
Known fixed:
============
mod\_dav\_svn+mod\_authz\_svn servers 1.14.1
mod\_dav\_svn+mod\_authz\_svn servers 1.10.7
Details:
========
A null-pointer-dereference has been found in mod\_authz\_svn that results in
a remote unauthenticated Denial-of-Service in some server configurations.
The vulnerability can be triggered by an unauthenticated user if the
Apache HTTPD server is configured to use an in-repository authz file,
with configuration directives such as:
AuthzSVNAccessFile "^/authz"
AuthzSVNReposRelativeAccessFile "^/authz"
The problem originates when sending a GET request to a non-existent
repository. The mod\_authz\_svn module will attempt to find authz rules
at a path within the requested SVN repository. Upon constructing this
path, the function svn\_repos\_find\_root\_path will return a NULL pointer
since the requested repository does not exist on-disk.
A check for this legitimate NULL pointer condition is missing, which
results in a segmentation fault when the NULL pointer is used.
The in-repository authz feature was first introduced in Subversion 1.8:
https://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.8.html#in-repo-authz
The missing NULL check was first introduced during refactoring of the
authz code during development work leading up to Subversion 1.9.
Subversion 1.8 servers are unaffected.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv3 Base Score: 7.5 (High)
CVSSv3 Base Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
Exploitation results in denial of service by crashing the HTTPD worker
handling the request. The impact of this differs depending on how the
Apache HTTPD server is configured, including the choice of MPM (Multi-
Processing-Module). If the worker shares its memory address space with
the main thread, as is the case with e.g. the Event MPM, the entire
HTTPD server process will terminate. If the pre-fork MPM is used, the
worker will terminate but the HTTPD server will stay up, and service
availability will depend on how frequently the attacker is able to
send malicious requests which target the vulnerability.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend all users to upgrade to a known fixed release of the
Subversion mod\_dav\_svn server.
Users who are unable to upgrade may apply the included patches.
As a workaround, the use of in-repository authz rules files with
the AuthzSVNReposRelativeAccessFile can be avoided by switching
to an alternative configuration which fetches an authz rules file
from the server's filesystem, rather than from an SVN repository.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
