Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-17366:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the way Routinator handles missing or corrupted files referenced in RPKI manifests. Specifically, if a manifest lists certain `.roa` (Route Origin Authorization) or `.crl` (Certificate Revocation List) files, and some of these files are missing or corrupted in the repository, Routinator would not invalidate the entire manifest. Instead, it would process the remaining valid files, leading to an incomplete and potentially incorrect set of Validated ROA Payloads (VRPs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Manifest Validation:** The core weakness is that Routinator does not treat a manifest as invalid if some of its referenced files are missing or corrupted. This is contrary to the expected behavior in secure RPKI validation.
*   **MITM Attack Vector:** This behavior opens up a vulnerability to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the rsync channel where an attacker could strategically withhold or corrupt certain `.roa` files.
*   **Inconsistent VRP Sets:** The processing of partially valid manifests results in incomplete or incorrect VRP sets, which can cause operational issues and incorrect routing decisions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Incorrect Routing Decisions:** An attacker manipulating the repository can cause specific routes to become RPKI invalid, potentially leading to denial of service or traffic redirection.
*   **Downtime:** Incomplete and invalid VRP data can lead to actual downtime in real networks.
*   **Operational Issues:** Inconsistent and partial VRP sets lead to unstable network behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker positioned between the RPKI publication point and the validator can intercept and manipulate the rsync channel.
*   **Strategic File Withholding:** The attacker can withhold certain `.roa` files from the validator, resulting in a partial set of VRPs.
*  **File Corruption:** The attacker can corrupt referenced .roa files such that they are unparsable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and manipulate the communication between the RPKI repository and the Routinator validator, typically through a MITM attack on the rsync channel.
*   **Ability to Modify Files:** The attacker needs the capability to either remove or modify the files in transit to the validator.

**Additional Notes:**
* The issue description provides a specific example of how an attacker can exploit this issue using a manipulated repository.
* The described behavior is also inconsistent with the `rpki-client` implementation, which invalidates the entire manifest when a file is missing.
*  The provided text recommends that a manifest as a whole should be considered invalid when it references a non-existent or wrongly checksummed file.
