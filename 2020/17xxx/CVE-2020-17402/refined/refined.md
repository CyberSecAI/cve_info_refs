Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-17402:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists within the `prl_hypervisor` kext (kernel extension) in Parallels Desktop. Specifically, a log file contains a memory address that can be disclosed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The core issue is the exposure of a memory address within a log file. This disclosure violates the principle of least privilege and can be used for further exploitation.
- **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource:** The ZDI advisory title explicitly mentions "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource," which suggests that the log file or the information it contains should not be accessible to low-privileged users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can gain knowledge of memory addresses which can then be used to bypass security mechanisms.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This vulnerability itself does not directly provide privilege escalation, but the disclosed information can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges to kernel level and execute code in the context of the kernel.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the target system, which could be achieved via compromised user accounts, supply chain attacks, or physical access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the log file containing the memory address.

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-17402 is an information disclosure vulnerability in Parallels Desktop that stems from a memory address being exposed in a log file. This vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker with low-privilege access to gather sensitive information, which could then be leveraged for privilege escalation. The specific vulnerability lies in the `prl_hypervisor` kext.
