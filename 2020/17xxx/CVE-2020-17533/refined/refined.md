- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of return values from policy enforcement functions in Apache Accumulo. Specifically, the return values of `canFlush` and `canPerformSystemActions` were not checked in some instances.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient permission checks, leading to authorization bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user with insufficient permissions can perform actions they should not be authorized to do. This includes flushing a table, shutting down Accumulo or an individual tablet server, and setting or removing system-wide Accumulo configuration properties.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Accumulo to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have an account within the vulnerable Accumulo instance. They would have insufficient permissions for the actions they are trying to perform, however, the vulnerability allows them to bypass those checks.
