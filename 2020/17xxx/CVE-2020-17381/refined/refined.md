Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2020-17381:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the insecure default installation directory permissions of Total Commander. Specifically, the default installation directory, `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\totalcmd\`, allows the "Authenticated Users" group to modify its contents. This allows any authenticated user to write to the directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the overly permissive directory permissions on the installation folder. This allows for arbitrary modification of the application's executable files.
- **Executable Replacement:** An attacker can replace the legitimate `TOTALCMD64.EXE` (or equivalent for 32-bit) with a malicious executable with the same name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who runs the replaced executable.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If a user with higher privileges (e.g., administrator) runs the compromised Total Commander executable, the attacker's code will execute with elevated privileges. This can lead to privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system.
- **Lateral Movement:** This vulnerability can also facilitate lateral movement within a network, by compromising user accounts and their respective access to other resources in the domain.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local attacker who has an account on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the system where Total Commander is installed.
- **File System Write Access:** The attacker must have write permissions to the default installation directory of Total Commander, which is granted by default to authenticated users.
- **Knowledge of Exploitable Location:** The attacker needs to know the location of the Total Commander installation and the executable to replace.

**Additional Details:**
- The vendor has been notified and has chosen not to fix the vulnerability because they consider most users to be local administrators and the issue can be mitigated by installing the program in Program Files.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) shows an attacker replacing the `TOTALCMD64.EXE` with a malicious binary, and subsequently, when an administrator runs the (compromised) program, the attacker gets a reverse shell with admin privileges.
- The vendor suggests installing Total Commander in `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Program Files\` or `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Program Files(x86)\` as a workaround, since these locations have more restrictive permissions by default.

This vulnerability is a classic example of a local privilege escalation due to insecure file system permissions.
