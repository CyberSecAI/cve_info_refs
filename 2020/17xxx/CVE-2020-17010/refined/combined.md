# Advisory Details

December 21st, 2020
## NETGEAR Multiple Routers mini\_httpd Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-20-1423ZDI-CAN-11653

| CVE ID | [CVE-2020-27867](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-27867) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.8, [AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [NETGEAR](https://www.netgear.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Multiple Routers |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6020, R6080, R6120, R6220, R6260, R6700v2, R6800, R6900v2, R7450, JNR3210, WNR2020, Nighthawk AC2100, and Nighthawk AC2400 routers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.  The specific flaw exists within the mini\_httpd service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. When parsing the funjsq\_access\_token parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | NETGEAR has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
