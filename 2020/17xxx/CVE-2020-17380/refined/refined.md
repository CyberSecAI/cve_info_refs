Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-17380:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content from ubuntu.com, lists.nongnu.org, openwall.com, and bugzilla.redhat.com all clearly reference CVE-2020-17380 and the vulnerability it describes, which is a heap-based buffer overflow in QEMU's SDHCI device emulation. Therefore, the content is related to this CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in QEMU's SDHCI (Secure Digital Host Controller Interface) device emulation.
    *   Specifically, the overflow occurs during multi-block SDMA (Secure Digital Memory Access) transfers within the `sdhci_sdma_transfer_multi_blocks()` function in the `hw/sd/sdhci.c` file.
    *   The root cause is insufficient bounds checking, where the `s->data_count` variable may exceed the bounds of the `s->fifo_buffer`, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
    *   The issue stems from improper calculation or handling of the data transfer size, potentially exceeding the allocated buffer.
    *   An incomplete fix was implemented (commit `dfba99f17feb6d4a129da19d38df1bcd8579d1c3`) initially, meaning the issue was still reproducible with specific crafted inputs.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability.
    *   Out-of-bounds read/write access.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A guest user or process can crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Potentially, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.
    *   **Data Confidentiality and Integrity:**  The vulnerability poses a threat to data confidentiality and integrity.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited by a guest user or process within a virtual machine.
    *   Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating SDMA transfers via the sdhci controller emulation.
    *   The vulnerability can occur during both read and write DMA operations.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a user within the guest virtual machine (local access).
    *   Low privileges are required within the guest OS
    *   The attack vector has a low attack complexity
    *   No user interaction is required to trigger this vulnerability.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was initially discovered by Alexander Bulekov.
*   Red Hat assigned CVE-2021-3409 to address the incomplete fix for this issue.
*   The initial patch (commit `dfba99f17feb6d4a129da19d38df1bcd8579d1c3`) used assertions that didn't prevent the overflow
*   A new patch series was proposed to fix the vulnerability effectively.
*  NetApp products are listed as "Not Affected" by this vulnerability.

**4. Severity:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as **Medium** severity by Ubuntu, with a CVSS v3 score of 6.3.
*   The CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L`, indicating a Local attack vector, Low attack complexity and low privileges required, No User interaction needed, with a scope changed. The Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impact are Low.

**5. Fix Information**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in various QEMU packages across different Ubuntu releases.
*   Upstream patch details include commit `dfba99f17feb6d4a129da19d38df1bcd8579d1c3` and  <https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-09/msg01175.html>.

In summary, CVE-2020-17380 is a medium-severity heap overflow in QEMU's SDHCI emulation that can be triggered by a malicious guest user, potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution on the host system. A failed initial patch led to CVE-2021-3409 being assigned to track a complete fix.
