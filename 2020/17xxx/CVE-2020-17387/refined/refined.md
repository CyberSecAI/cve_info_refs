Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-17387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `writeObjectToConfigFile` method of the `GWTTestServiceImpl` class in Marvell QConvergeConsole.
- The root cause is the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path before using it in file operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Directory Traversal: The vulnerability allows an attacker to write files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system due to insufficient path validation.
- Remote Code Execution: By writing malicious files to specific locations, an attacker can achieve remote code execution.
- Authentication Bypass: The vulnerability can be exploited even though authentication is required, due to a bypass in the authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with SYSTEM privileges.
- Complete System Compromise: Full compromise of the server is possible due to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack is conducted remotely.
- User-supplied path: The attacker provides a malicious path through a request to the affected method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network connectivity to the QConvergeConsole server.
- Authenticated access (can be bypassed): While authentication is required, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. Therefore, a valid account may not be required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2020-04-01 and publicly released on 2020-08-10.
- Marvell released an update to fix the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-20-974 (ZDI-CAN-10565).
