Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2020-17390

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Parallels Desktop hypervisor kernel extension.
- The core issue is a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This missing validation allows for a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to insufficient input validation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate their privileges.
- Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute code within the context of the hypervisor, effectively gaining elevated privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the target system and the ability to run code with low privileges.
