Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2020-17409:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* Incorrect string matching logic within the `mini_httpd` service when accessing protected pages. This service listens on TCP port 80 by default on the affected Netgear routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* Authentication Bypass: The vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication checks.
* Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including stored credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* Disclosure of stored credentials, which can be used for further compromise of the device and possibly the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
* Network-adjacent access is required.
* The attacker needs to send specific requests to the mini_httpd service to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable router.
* No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
* The attacker needs to craft requests to exploit the incorrect string matching logic.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability affects multiple Netgear router models including R6120, R6080, R6260, R6220, R6020, JNR3210, and WNR2020.
* Netgear released firmware updates to fix the issue, and also recommends turning off Remote Management as a workaround.
* The vulnerability was reported to the vendor by an anonymous researcher working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
* The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.5 (Medium).
