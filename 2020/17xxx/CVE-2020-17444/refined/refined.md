{
  "CVE-2020-17444": {
    "Root cause": "The function in picoTCP-NG and picoTCP that processes IPv6 headers does not check the lengths of extension header options.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can force the function into an infinite loop with crafted length values, causing a denial-of-service.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending crafted IPv6 packets with malicious header options.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target device. Low skill level is required."
