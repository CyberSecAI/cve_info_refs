Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-17480:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability stemming from improper parsing and sanitization of HTML content within the TinyMCE editor's core parser and the `paste` and `visualchars` plugins. Specifically, the editor failed to correctly sanitize HTML-like text, converting it to DOM elements, and didn't sanitize pasted content in all cases.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS. Malicious content inserted via clipboard or API could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser. This affects users of TinyMCE versions prior to 4.9.7 and 5.1.4

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:

*   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser session.
*   Potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
*   Perform actions on behalf of the user (e.g., modifying content, redirecting to malicious sites).
*   Deface the website by injecting malicious HTML content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Clipboard:** Copying specially crafted HTML content and pasting it into the TinyMCE editor.
*   **API:** Inserting malicious content through the TinyMCE API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to insert content into a TinyMCE editor.
*   The attacker must craft malicious HTML/JavaScript that exploits the sanitization flaws in the specified versions of TinyMCE.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** TinyMCE versions below 4.9.7 and 5.1.4.
*   **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in TinyMCE 4.9.7 and 5.1.4.
*   **Workarounds:**
    *   Disable the `paste` and `visualchars` plugins.
    *   Manually sanitize content using the `BeforeSetContent` event.
    *   Upgrade to the patched version.
