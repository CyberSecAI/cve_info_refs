- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A malformed DHCPv6 packet can cause an incorrect route to be installed in Arista EOS when the "ipv6 dhcp relay install routes" option is configured. This incorrect route can lead to the restart of agents responsible for processing routes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect route installation due to malformed DHCPv6 packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Agent restarts of SandL3Unicast, Ira, Arp, or Snmp agents, potentially impacting feature usability.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malformed DHCPv6 packet to a routed port where DHCP Relay is listening.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send malformed DHCPv6 packets to the affected device, specifically to a routed port where DHCP Relay is active and configured with the "ipv6 dhcp relay install routes" option.
