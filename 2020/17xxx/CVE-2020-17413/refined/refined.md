  "CVE_data": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2020-17413",
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PhantomPDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of U3D objects embedded in PDF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data when handling U3D objects embedded in PDF files. This allows writing data beyond the boundaries of a fixed-length stack-based buffer.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
    "Attack vector": "The attack vector involves opening a malicious PDF file containing a specially crafted U3D object, or visiting a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability via an embedded malicious PDF.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PDF file or control a website to serve a malicious PDF to be opened by the victim.",
    "Additional details": "The advisory provides specific details about where the flaw occurs within the handling of U3D objects embedded in PDF files, including the lack of validation on the length of user-supplied data."
