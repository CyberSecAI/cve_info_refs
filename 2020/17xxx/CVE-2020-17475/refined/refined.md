- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of authentication in network relays used in MEGVII Koala 2.9.1-c3s.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authorization (CWE-862)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can grant physical access to anyone by sending packet data to UDP port 5000 of any network relays connected to doors. This allows for unauthorized entry.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to the LAN of the facial recognition access controller can send the string "on1" to UDP port 5000 of all the network relay devices connected to doors to open them.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the internal network (LAN) where the facial recognition access controller and the network relays are connected.
