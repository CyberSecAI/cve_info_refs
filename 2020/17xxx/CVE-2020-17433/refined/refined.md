    "description": "Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to an Untrusted URL Invocation vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents, which attackers could exploit to access the resources or execute malicious actions under users’ systems by embedding malicious images or codes in PDF documents. This occurs as the application loads images from all resources (including those untrusted) when parsing the image resources or fails to properly request user confirmation before getting or posting content from external HTTP servers.",
