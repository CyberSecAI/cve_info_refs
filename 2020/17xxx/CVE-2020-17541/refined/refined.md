The provided content describes a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the `encode_one_block` function of libjpeg-turbo, as reported in issue #392 on the libjpeg-turbo GitHub repository.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow occurs in the `encode_one_block` function located in `jchuff.c`. This overflow happens when writing to the `_buffer` variable on the stack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow in `jchuff.c`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The stack buffer overflow can lead to a crash, and potentially, arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted JPEG file using the `jpegtran` tool. The crash is triggered by `jpegtran-static -transverse ~/Desktop/poc.jpg`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted JPEG file to a vulnerable instance of libjpeg-turbo.
