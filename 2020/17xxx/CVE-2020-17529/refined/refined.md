- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write in the TCP stack due to an invalid fragmentation offset value specified in the IP header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors**: Supplying an invalid fragmentation offset value in the IP header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted IP packets with a malicious fragmentation offset to the vulnerable system.
