```
Root cause of vulnerability:
A REST handler introduced in Flink 1.5.1 allows writing an uploaded file to an arbitrary location on the local file system through a maliciously modified HTTP HEADER.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Directory traversal vulnerability. The vulnerability lies in the REST API handler not sanitizing the file path provided in the HTTP header, allowing an attacker to write files to any location on the filesystem accessible by Flink.

Impact of exploitation:
Remote file writing to an arbitrary location, which could lead to arbitrary code execution or other malicious activities.

Attack vectors:
Maliciously crafted HTTP requests to the Flink REST API, with the file path specified in a modified HTTP header.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Flink REST API. The Flink instance must be exposed to the attacker's network.
