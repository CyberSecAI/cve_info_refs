Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2020-17479:

**Summary:**
CVE-2020-17479 is a validation bypass vulnerability in the `jpv` (JSON Pattern Validator) library. It's a follow-up to CVE-2019-19507, which was initially thought to be fixed. However, a new bypass was discovered, leading to the assignment of this new CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in how `jpv` validates JSON objects, specifically when checking if an object is an array. The original fix for CVE-2019-19507 checked if the constructors of the object and the expected array matched. However, this check could be bypassed by setting a malicious object's constructor to `[].constructor`, effectively mimicking an array.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inadequate validation:** The initial fix for CVE-2019-19507 was insufficient, relying on constructor comparison, which is easily spoofed.
- **Type confusion:** The vulnerability stems from confusion between objects and arrays due to the ability to manipulate an object's constructor property.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could provide a malicious JSON object that bypasses the validation checks implemented by the jpv library.
- This could lead to the application processing or storing malformed or unexpected JSON data, leading to potential application errors, data corruption, or other security issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a JSON object with the `constructor` property set to `[].constructor`, the attacker can make `jpv` incorrectly identify the object as an array, and pass the validation process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input JSON that is being validated by `jpv`.
- They need to be able to set the `constructor` property of an object to `[].constructor` to bypass the validation.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Sonatype Security Research Team while revisiting CVE-2019-19507.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) was shared with the `jpv` project maintainers, who promptly fixed the issue.
- The fix in `jpv` version 2.2.2 includes checks with `Array.isArray` function and other checks to properly validate arrays.
- Sonatype customers were notified about the bypass and received remediation instructions.
- The `jpv` library maintainers addressed the vulnerability by adding a specific check for arrays, using the `Array.isArray` function along with other checks.
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `jpv` that contain the fix for CVE-2019-19507 but are lower than 2.2.2

This detailed breakdown should provide a good understanding of the vulnerability described in CVE-2020-17479.
