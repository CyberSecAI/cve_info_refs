{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database or displaying it to users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: Malicious script code injected through blog post parameters is stored in the database as an error and executed in the browser of users with \"Error Log\" access.",
    "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: Malicious script code injected through the 'text' parameter of the preview.ajax.php script is executed in the browser of users."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform unauthorized actions on behalf of another user, intercept access information, and other sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Stored XSS: An attacker with \"edit post\" capability can inject malicious script code via the 'blog_image', 'blog_image_t1', and 'blog_image_t2' parameters while editing a blog post.",
    "Reflected XSS: An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious script code via the 'text' parameter in the preview.ajax.php script. This can be exploited through CSRF."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Stored XSS: Requires an attacker to have user account with “edit post” privileges.",
    "Reflected XSS: Can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker. Requires the victim to load attacker-crafted HTML page."
