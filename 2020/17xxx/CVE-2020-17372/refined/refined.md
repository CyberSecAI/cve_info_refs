Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2020-17372:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it's used to generate HTML output. Specifically, this occurs with the parameters `do`, `current_step`, and `updated_records`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. When a victim user accesses the crafted URL, the malicious code is executed within their browser, potentially leading to:

*   Session hijacking
*   Defacement of the web page
*   Redirection to malicious sites
*   Stealing of sensitive information
*   Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript within the vulnerable parameters:
    *   `do` parameter when `action` is set to `metadata`
    *   `current_step` parameter in the `Reports` module
    *   `updated_records` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft malicious URLs containing JavaScript payloads.
*   The attacker needs to trick a victim user into clicking on these crafted URLs.

**Additional Details:**
