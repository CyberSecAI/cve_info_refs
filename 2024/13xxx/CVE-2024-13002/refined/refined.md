Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to the Bookstore Management System:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the direct use of unvalidated input from the `fnm` parameter in SQL queries within the `/order_process.php` file. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Specifically, it's susceptible to time-based blind SQL injection.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied input, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.
- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The code does not use prepared statements or parameter binding, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Data Leakage:** Sensitive data can be stolen from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Critical information can be modified or deleted.
- **Potential System Control:** The attacker might gain control of the system.
- **Service Interruption:** Malicious queries can lead to service disruption or downtime.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `fnm` POST parameter in the `/order_process.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can send a specially crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint with a malicious `fnm` parameter.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
