username and password for ADMIN is “admin” “admin” with no capital letters. If the system displays invalid input error with the USER’s username and password that we provided then, simply sign up to the system otherwise you might have spelled it wrong!

AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CREATED A DATABASE NAMING “chat\_system”

Go To “localhost/phpmyadmin” in any browser. then click on Database tab, create Database (name it according to SQL file).In that Database, click on Import tab/section and down there’s a Browse button click on it and select the SQL file which we have provided you in database or sql folder inside the main project folder.

there is an error in register.php file near line:

mysqli\_query($conn,”insert into `user` (uname, username, password, access) values (‘$fname’, ‘$fusername’, ‘$fpassword’, ‘2’)”);

IT SHOULD BE THE FOLLOWING:

mysqli\_query($conn,”insert into `user` (username, password, uname, photo, access) values ( ‘$fusername’, ‘$fpassword’,’$fname’,”, ‘2’)”);

OTHERWISE YOU WONT BE ABLE TO CREATE NEW SIGNUP
