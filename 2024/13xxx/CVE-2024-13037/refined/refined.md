The provided content relates to CVE-2024-13037.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is that the `course_id` parameter from the `/admin/report.php` endpoint is directly used in SQL queries without proper cleansing or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization.
- Direct use of user-supplied input in SQL queries.
- No authentication or authorization is required to exploit the identified vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access: Attackers can read or retrieve sensitive information.
- Data leakage: Confidential records such as attendance logs or user information may be exposed.
- Data manipulation: Potential to create, update, or delete rows maliciously.
- System disruption: Use of time-based (SLEEP) queries could degrade performance or crash services.
- Wider network risks: Lateral movement if privileged credentials are compromised.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `/admin/report.php`
- Manipulation of the `course_id` parameter

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No authentication is required

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable application is the "Attendance Tracking Management System (PHP & MySQL) v1.0".
- The vulnerability can be exploited via a time-based blind SQL injection technique using the `SLEEP()` function.
- The attacker can use `sqlmap` to automate the exploitation.
