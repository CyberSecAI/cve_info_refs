Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input in the `action_service` function within the `roxy.py` module. Specifically, the `service` parameter, which is taken from user input, is directly incorporated into a system command executed using `os.system`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **OS Command Injection:** The most significant vulnerability is the OS command injection. Since the `service` parameter is not validated or sanitized, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the system.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The code does not filter or validate the `service` parameter before using it in a system command.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `/tools/update/<service>` endpoint, where `<service>` is a parameter that the attacker controls.
- The service parameter is then passed to `action_service` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an admin on the Roxy-WI server.
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the server's web interface.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in premium Roxy-WI servers.
- The provided PoC demonstrates how a simple `sleep` command can be injected via URL encoding to confirm the vulnerability.
- A fix was implemented that uses a regular expression to validate the `service` parameter in the `action_service` function.

```python
if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9\.\-]+$', service):
    return f"Invalid service name: {service}. Only alphanumeric characters, dots, and hyphens are allowed."
```
