### @0xs1ash **[0xs1ash](/0xs1ash)** commented [Dec 24, 2024](#issue-2757808526) • edited Loading

Hello, I have found an OS command injection vulnerability in your project, which allows authenticated remote code execution on the premium proxy-wi servers. As shown below, please ensure that the service parameter taken from the user is passed through a regex filter before being used in the cmd parameter, otherwise it will be executed via os.system, leading to code execution on the operating system.

## POC

1. **app/routes/admin/routes.py**

### @0xs1ash **[0xs1ash](/0xs1ash)** commented [Dec 24, 2024](#issue-2757808526) • edited Loading

Hello, I have found an OS command injection vulnerability in your project, which allows authenticated remote code execution on the premium proxy-wi servers. As shown below, please ensure that the service parameter taken from the user is passed through a regex filter before being used in the cmd parameter, otherwise it will be executed via os.system, leading to code execution on the operating system.
