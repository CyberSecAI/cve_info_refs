Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper access control in the web management interface of the D-Link DIR-816A2 router. Specifically, the `form2AdvanceSetup.cgi` endpoint does not properly validate user authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication checks on the `form2AdvanceSetup.cgi` endpoint. This allows unauthenticated users to send requests to this endpoint.
- **Direct Object Reference:** The `goform` endpoint appears to directly act on the provided parameters in the POST request without sufficient validation. This allows manipulation of advanced settings through crafted parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** An attacker can remotely modify the 2.4G and 5G advanced settings of the affected router.
- **Possible Denial of Service:** By misconfiguring the router, an attacker could cause the device to malfunction or become unreachable, leading to a denial of service.
- **Further Exploitation:**  Manipulating settings could potentially create avenues for more severe attacks such as network access or interception of network traffic.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `goform` endpoint.
- **Specific Header:** The request must include the header specifying `form2AdvanceSetup.cgi`, which is the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attack does not require authentication.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the web management interface of the vulnerable D-Link router (which might be exposed on the local network or via remote access depending on the configuration).
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to craft and send HTTP POST requests.
