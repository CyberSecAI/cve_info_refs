Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application fails to invalidate or remove JWT (JSON Web Tokens) upon user logout.
- The same JWT can be used across different instances of the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **JWT Reuse:**  The application doesn't invalidate JWTs upon logout, leading to them being perpetually valid.
- **Universal JWT:** The JWT is not tied to a specific user session, allowing it to be used by any user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:**  An attacker can use a leaked or intercepted valid JWT to bypass authentication and gain administrator-level access to the application and associated resources. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or complete system takeover.
- **Widespread Impact:** The vulnerability affects all instances of the application due to the universal nature of the JWT.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Interception:**  An attacker could intercept a JWT in transit, particularly if the traffic is not encrypted.
- **Leaked Tokens:**  If a valid JWT is somehow made public (e.g. through logging, or insecure storage) it can be used by an attacker.
- **Replay Attacks**: If a user logs out but the token is still valid, this allows an attacker to use the same token and potentially log back in as that user.
- **Direct API Access**: With a valid JWT, an attacker can directly make API requests to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs a valid JWT. This can be obtained through network interception, leakage, or by capturing one during an actual login.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information is based on a GitHub issue report which provides more technical details and a proof of concept, going into more detail than a standard CVE description.
- The attacker uses a fixed JWT (eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3MzQ5NTQ2NjEsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoicGVyc29uIn0.6tEVOLvOYme17vn8p4UF2mTG2oxwtCPgHzgQ7Fxmga4) to gain access and send a POST request to `/exam/api/sys/user/paging`.
- The code snippet `src/main/java/com/yf/exam/modules/sys/user/controller/SysUserControl.java` is referenced as the location where the vulnerability occurs when a user logs out.
