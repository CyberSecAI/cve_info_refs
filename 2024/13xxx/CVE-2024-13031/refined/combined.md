## CVE-2024-13031 - Reflected XSS in content editor of Antabot White-Jotter 0.2.2

### Description:

A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in authenticated content editing functionality in Antabot White-Jotter 0.2.2. It is immediately triggered after a valid XSS payload is input within the content editor.

### Affected Component:

* Endpoint: `/admin/content/editor`
* Application Version: 0.2.2

### Type of Vulnerability:

CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

### Steps to Reproduce / PoC:

* For local testing, login to the backend and navigate to `http://localhost:8443/admin/content/editor`.
* Within the article content editor, input an XSS payload such as:

```
<img src="bad" onerror="alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))"></img>
```

* Immediately after supplying an XSS payload within the editor, a reflected XSS would occur.

### Root Cause:

The application fails to properly sanitize input fields used in the content editor. Specifically, attributes like onerror within HTML elements are not validated or escaped, allowing JavaScript code execution.

### Mitigation Recommendations:

1. Input Validation and Sanitization:

   * Validate and sanitize all user input within the content editor to prevent injection of malicious code.
   * Use a trusted library, such as DOMPurify, to remove dangerous attributes and scripts.
2. Content Security Policy (CSP):
   Implement a CSP to limit the execution of inline JavaScript or restrict resource loading to trusted domains.
