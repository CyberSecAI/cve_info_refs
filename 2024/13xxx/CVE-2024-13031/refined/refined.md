- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize input fields used in the content editor. Specifically, attributes like `onerror` within HTML elements are not validated or escaped, allowing JavaScript code execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `/admin/content/editor` endpoint where an attacker can input a malicious XSS payload within the article content editor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be authenticated to the backend of the application.
