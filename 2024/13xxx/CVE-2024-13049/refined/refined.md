- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing XE files, leading to a type confusion condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Type confusion vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit this by enticing a user to open a malicious XE file or visit a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious XE file or a malicious page to the target. User interaction is required.
