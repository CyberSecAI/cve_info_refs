- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CO files, leading to a type confusion condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Type confusion vulnerability in the parsing of CO files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by enticing the user to open a malicious CO file or visit a malicious web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious CO file or host a malicious webpage. User interaction is required, as the target must open the malicious file or visit the malicious page. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system.
