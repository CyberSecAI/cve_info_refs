Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-13039.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability found in the `add_user.php` file of the "Simple Chat System" project. This is due to the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `name` parameter, which is directly used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in `add_user.php`
- Insufficient user input validation of the `name` parameter

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access
- Sensitive data leakage
- Data tampering
- Comprehensive system control
- Service interruption

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `add_user.php`
- Malicious SQL code injected via the `name` parameter

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No login or authorization required
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection
- The vulnerable parameter is `name` in the POST request.
- The provided payload demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using `SLEEP()` function, which causes a time delay if the injected code is executed, indicating successful injection.
- The report also includes screenshots showing the exploitation using `sqlmap`.
- The suggested repair includes using prepared statements, input validation and filtering, minimizing database user permissions, and regular security audits.
