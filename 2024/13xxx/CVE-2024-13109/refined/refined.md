Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `ShiroConfig.java` file within the `yfexam-exam` project. Specifically, the `doc.html` path does not have access permissions set.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of access control on the `doc.html` endpoint. This allows unauthenticated users to access it.
- **Interface Exposure:** The `doc.html` endpoint exposes all application interfaces.
- **API documentation exposure:** The `/v2/api-docs` endpoint also lacks proper authentication, exposing API documentation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can access the `doc.html` path without authentication and view the application's interfaces.
- **Information Disclosure:** This can reveal sensitive information about the application's internal workings, API endpoints, and possibly data structures.
- **Potential for further attacks:** Knowledge gained from the exposed interfaces could be used to plan further attacks on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by directly requesting the `doc.html` endpoint (`http://192.168.0.106:8101/doc.html`) or the `/v2/api-docs` endpoint without prior authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application, specifically to the exposed `doc.html` and `/v2/api-docs` paths.
- **No authentication needed**: The attacker does not need any authentication credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes links to images showing the exposed interface documentation and API documentation.
- The vulnerability was identified in version 1.9.2 of `yfexam-exam`.
- The vulnerability was reported in a GitHub issue.
