Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation or authorization in the `PaperController.java` file within the `yfexam-exam` application. Specifically, the application doesn't restrict the input ID when accessing exam results, which allows users to directly view the answers of any exam by manipulating the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application directly uses the exam ID provided in the URL to retrieve and display the exam results, without verifying if the user is authorized to view those results.
*   **Lack of Authorization:** There's no proper authorization check to ensure that only the user who took the exam can view the results during the answering process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cheating in Exams:** By directly accessing the exam result URL, a user can view all correct answers before or during the exam, enabling them to cheat and obtain a perfect score.
*   **Compromised Exam Integrity:** The vulnerability undermines the integrity of the exam process, making it unreliable.
*   **Potential for Unfair Advantage:** Users who exploit this vulnerability gain an unfair advantage over others.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** The attacker can directly manipulate the exam ID in the URL (`http://192.168.0.106:8101/#/my/exam/result/{examId}`) to view results of any exam.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Exam ID Format:** The attacker needs to understand how the exam IDs are generated or be able to guess/brute-force them to access arbitrary exam results.
*   **Access to the Application:** The attacker must have access to the exam application and be able to navigate to the exam interface and modify the URL.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `src/main/java/com/yf/exam/modules/paper/controller/PaperController.java`.
*   The identified version with the vulnerability is `yfexam-exam` version `1.9.2`.
*   The attacker can view the answers during the answering process, not just after the exam is submitted.
*   The provided screenshots show that by manipulating the URL, it is possible to directly see the correct answers.
