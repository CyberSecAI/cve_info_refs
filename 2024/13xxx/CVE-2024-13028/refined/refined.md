{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application's error handling logic leaks information by providing differentiated responses for login failures, making it possible for attackers to enumerate valid usernames.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Observable Response Discrepancy (CWE-204)"
    ],
    "impact": "User Enumeration: Attackers can distinguish valid usernames from invalid ones based on server responses. Targeted Attacks: Knowledge of valid usernames facilitates brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the `/login` endpoint of the application.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the `/login` endpoint of the application. No special permissions are required."

    "affected_component": "Endpoint: `/login`, Application Version: White-Jotter 0.2.2",
    "steps_to_reproduce": [
      "Navigate to http://localhost:8443/login for a default local installation.",
      "Input a non-existent username, leave the password field empty.",
      "Click 'Login'.",
      "Observe the response 'User does not exist'.",
      "Input an existing username and leave the password field empty.",
      "Click 'Login'.",
       "Observe the response 'Wrong password'." ,
       "Compare the responses to identify valid users."

    "mitigation_recommendations": [
      "Return a uniform error message (e.g., 'Invalid login') for all failed login attempts.",
      "Implement rate-limiting mechanisms to restrict the number of login attempts.",
      "Lock accounts temporarily after repeated failed login attempts.",
      "Ensure consistent response timing for both valid and invalid username or passwords."
