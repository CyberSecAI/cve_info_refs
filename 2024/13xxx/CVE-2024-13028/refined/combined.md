## CVE-2024-13028 - Observable Response Discrepancy Vulnerability allowing for User Enumeration in Antabot White-Jotter 0.2.2

### Description:

An observable response discrepancy vulnerability exists in the Antabot White-Jotter 0.2.2 application at the `/login` endpoint. During the login process, the server can return two different responses, "User does not exist" and "Wrong password". This allows attackers to determine the existence of user accounts. By analyzing the distinct responses, attackers can enumerate valid usernames and use this information to perform targeted attacks such as credential stuffing.

### Affected Component:

* Endpoint: `/login`
* Application Version: White-Jotter 0.2.2

### Type of Vulnerability:

[CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/204.html)

### Impact:

* User Enumeration: Attackers can distinguish valid usernames from invalid ones based on server responses.
* Targeted Attacks: Knowledge of valid usernames facilitates brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

### Steps to Reproduce / PoC:

1. Set Up:
   * Navigate to <http://localhost:8443/login> for a default local installation.
2. Inputs:
   * Input a non-existent username, leave the password field empty.
   * Click "Login".
   * If a user exists, it will show "Wrong password".
   * If a the supplied user does not exist, it will show "User does not exist".
3. Compare Responses:
   * Note the difference in server responses, allowing the attacker to determine which accounts exist.

### Root Cause:

The application's error handling logic leaks information by providing differentiated responses for login failures, making it possible for attackers to enumerate valid usernames.

### Mitigation Recommendations:

1. **Generic Error Messaging:**

   * Return a uniform error message (e.g., "Invalid login") for all failed login attempts, regardless of the username or password validity.
2. **Rate Limiting and Account Lockouts:**

   * Implement rate-limiting mechanisms to restrict the number of login attempts from a single source.
   * Lock accounts temporarily after repeated failed login attempts.
3. **Response Timing:**

   * Ensure consistent response timing for both valid and invalid username or passwords to prevent potential timing-based attacks.
