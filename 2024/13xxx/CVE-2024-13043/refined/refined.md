- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the Hotspot Shield component of Panda Security Dome. By creating a junction, an attacker can abuse the application to delete arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file deletion vulnerability due to insecure handling of junctions within the Hotspot Shield.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. Then they can create a junction to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system is required to exploit this vulnerability.
