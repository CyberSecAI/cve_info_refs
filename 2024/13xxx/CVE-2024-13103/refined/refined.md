Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-13103 (Based on the context it is the most likely CVE ID for this vulnerability)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper access control in the web management interface of the D-Link DIR-816A2 router. Specifically, the `form2AddVrtsrv.cgi` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication/Authorization:** The primary issue is that the `goform` endpoint, when accessed with `form2AddVrtsrv.cgi` in the header, does not require authentication. This allows unauthenticated attackers to send requests to modify the virtual server settings.
- **Improper Access Control:** The web interface fails to enforce proper access control mechanisms, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can set the virtual server configurations on the vulnerable D-Link DIR-816A2 device. This can be used to redirect traffic to malicious servers, expose internal services to the internet, or cause other types of network disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `goform` endpoint.
- The `form2AddVrtsrv.cgi` value needs to be set in the header of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web management interface. This typically requires network access to the router's local network.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected version is specifically identified as DIR-816A2 v1.10 and the firmware as DIR-816A2\_FWv1.10CNB05\_R1B011D88210.
- The provided content includes a Proof-of-Concept (POC) which demonstrates the ability to set virtual server configurations using the vulnerability.
