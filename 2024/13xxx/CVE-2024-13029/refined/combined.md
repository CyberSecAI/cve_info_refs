## CVE-2024-13029 - Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability in Book Cover URL Specification Functionality of Antabot White-Jotter 0.2.2

### Description:

A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the book cover URL specification functionality of Antabot White-Jotter version 0.2.2. This vulnerability arises because the application allows users to specify arbitrary URLs from the admin page to fetch book cover images. An attacker can exploit this functionality to force the server to make unauthorized requests to internal services or external targets, potentially exposing sensitive information or enabling further attacks.

### Affected Component:

* Endpoint: `/admin/content/book` (cover value)
* Application Version: White-Jotter 0.2.2

### Type of Vulnerability:

[CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html)

### Impact:

* Unauthorized Internal Access: Attackers can access internal services or network-restricted endpoints through SSRF.

### Steps to Reproduce / PoC:

1. Set Up:

   * Setup a Python server on port 443 as such:
   ```
    python3 -m http.server 443
   ```
2. Inputs:

   * Navigate to `http://localhost:8443/admin/content/book`.
   * Modify an existing book listing by clicking "Edit" on any book row.
   * For the "Cover" input box, specify <http://127.0.0.1:443>
   * Click "Save"
3. Triggering SSRF:

   * Load the main book catalogue page that regular users will see at `http://localhost:8443/library`
   * Observe the Python server receiving a GET request on port 443 as such:
   ```
   Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 443 (http://0.0.0.0:443/) ...
   127.0.0.1 - - [x/x/x x:x:x] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
   ```

### Root Cause:

The application does not validate or sanitize user-provided URLs for the book cover upload functionality. This lack of restriction allows attackers to supply arbitrary URLs, leading to SSRF.

### Mitigation Recommendations:

1. **Input Validation:**

   * Restrict the allowed URLs to trusted domains using a whitelist.
2. **Network Restrictions:**

   * Configure the backend to restrict outbound requests to necessary domains and block access to internal/private IP ranges.
