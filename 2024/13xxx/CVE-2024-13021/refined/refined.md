Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `mark_name` parameter in the `/endpoint/add-mark.php` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores the unsanitized user input. When other users view the marked road accident area, the injected JavaScript code executes within their browsers. This is a classic stored XSS vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who view the affected page.
- **Session Hijacking:** The injected script could potentially steal session cookies, allowing the attacker to hijack user sessions.
- **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to steal sensitive information from users.
- **Malicious activities:** The injected JavaScript code can redirect users to malicious websites or perform unwanted actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a POST request to the `/road-accident-map-marker/endpoint/add-mark.php` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `mark_name` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious Javascript code into the `mark_name` parameter.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided proof of concept (POC) uses the payload `<img+src=x+onerror=alert('PwnedPixel')>` to demonstrate the XSS vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is located in the Road Accident Map Marker functionality.

The provided information gives a clear picture of the stored XSS vulnerability in the Road Accident Map Marker application.
