Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a **Broken Access Control** vulnerability in the "Online Food Ordering System" application. Specifically, there is a lack of proper authentication and authorization checks when accessing admin pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication Checks:** The application fails to verify if a user is logged in and has the necessary administrative privileges before granting access to admin pages. This allows unauthenticated users to bypass the login process.
*   **Direct Access to Admin Pages:** The vulnerability allows direct access to restricted admin pages simply by navigating to their URL without any authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the administrative interface of the application without needing valid credentials.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Through the administrative interface, an attacker may be able to view sensitive data, such as user information, orders, and other potentially confidential information.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Once inside the administrative interface, an attacker can perform unauthorized actions, such as:
    *   Modifying user data.
    *   Changing system settings.
    *   Potentially disrupting or taking down the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** The attack vector is a direct HTTP GET request to an administrative page, such as ` /OnlineFood-PHP/admin/all_users.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to possess any valid user credentials.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an unauthenticated user can access the `/OnlineFood-PHP/admin/all_users.php` page.
*   The vendor is identified as "CodeAstro" and the product is the "Online Food Ordering System," available at the specified URL.
*   The provided content is more descriptive than a typical CVE description, with detailed proof of concept and impact.
