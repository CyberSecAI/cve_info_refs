Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of AR files within Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt. Specifically, it's caused by the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before it is copied to a stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The primary weakness is a stack buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious AR Files:** The attack vector involves enticing the target to open a specially crafted, malicious AR file.
* **Malicious Web Page:** Alternatively, the target can be lured to a web page containing malicious content which triggers the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction; the target must either open a malicious AR file or visit a malicious web page.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely.
