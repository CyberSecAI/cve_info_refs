- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing VC6 files. This occurs before the data is copied to a heap-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious VC6 file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious VC6 file or a malicious web page to be able to trigger the vulnerability. User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
