- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of AR files within Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt, where insufficient validation of user-supplied data leads to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper input validation when parsing AR files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a malicious AR file, which the target user must open or visit a malicious page hosting such a file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a specially crafted malicious AR file and entice the user to open it, or host the file on a malicious page. The attacker does not need any prior privileges on the system.
