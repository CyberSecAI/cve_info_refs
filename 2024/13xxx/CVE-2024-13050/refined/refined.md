- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of user-supplied data length when parsing VC6 files, specifically before copying it into a heap-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious VC6 file or visits a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted VC6 file to the user, requiring user interaction (opening the file or visiting a malicious page). The attacker can be remote.
