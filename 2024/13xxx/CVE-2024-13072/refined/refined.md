{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient sanitization of user inputs in the 'Array-like #1* ((custom) POST)' parameter. The system constructs SQL statements with these parameters directly, allowing attackers to embed arbitrary code into the query.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization",
      "Direct use of user-controlled input in SQL queries"
     ],
    "impact": "Attackers may escalate privileges, read sensitive data, make unauthorized modifications, leak confidential information, cause service interruption via malicious queries, and potentially gain broader system-level access.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is located in `/admin/add-customer-services.php` and is exploited through the 'Array-like #1* ((custom) POST)' parameter via HTTP POST requests.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, suggesting any unauthenticated user can send malicious requests."
