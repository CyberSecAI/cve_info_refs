- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of XE files in Ashlar-Vellum Cobalt. This allows for a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the parsing of XE files due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires user interaction, either by visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious XE file or induce a user to visit a malicious webpage that triggers the vulnerability, but does not require any special privileges on the system to initiate the attack.
