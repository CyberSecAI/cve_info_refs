Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-13070 (Note: While the CVE description is a placeholder, the provided content describes a specific vulnerability that could be associated with this ID.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an SQL injection flaw in the `update_users.php` page of the "Online Food Ordering System" application developed by CodeAstro.
- The vulnerable code directly uses the `$_GET['user_upd']` parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks due to the direct inclusion of user-supplied input (`$_GET['user_upd']`) into an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to inject malicious SQL queries that can create a PHP backdoor file (cmd.php) on the server. This file allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code and thereby gain remote control of the server.
- **Data Breach:** An attacker may gain access to sensitive data stored in the database by crafting specific SQL injection queries.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** It may be possible to disrupt service availability through database manipulation or server resource exhaustion via malicious queries.
- **Complete System Compromise:** The ability to execute code remotely allows for the complete compromise of the system, including gaining access to files, databases, and potentially other systems on the same network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request targeting the vulnerable `update_users.php` page and includes the payload as part of the `user_upd` query parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the application to send HTTP requests.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to possess a basic understanding of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques to craft a malicious payload to bypass the injection.
- **Targeted Application:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable application URL and specific vulnerable parameter name (`user_upd`).

**Technical Details:**
- The provided code snippet `<?php $ssql ="select * from users where u_id='$_GET[user_upd]'";  $res=mysqli_query($db, $ssql); $newrow=mysqli_fetch_array($res);?>` shows the vulnerable SQL query where `$_GET[user_upd]` is directly used without any sanitization.
- The proof of concept shows how the attacker can inject a crafted SQL query that creates a PHP file containing a system call, allowing for arbitrary command execution by accessing `cmd.php?0=<command>`.
- The attacker is using `UNION SELECT` statement to inject PHP code into the database, which is then written to a file using `INTO OUTFILE`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content offers a detailed explanation and proof of concept, including a sample HTTP request and a screenshot that illustrates the vulnerability exploitation.
- The vulnerability is present in the "Online Food Ordering System" application provided by CodeAstro which makes it highly relevant to this specific system.
