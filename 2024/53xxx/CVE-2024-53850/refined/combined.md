## Package

addressing
(pluginsglpi)

## Affected versions

>= 3.0.0 < 3.0.3

## Patched versions

## Description

# Impact

A poor security check allows an unauthenticated attacker to determine whether data exists (by name) in GLPI.

# Patches

Update to 3.0.3

### Severity

High

8.2

# CVSS overall score

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-53850
