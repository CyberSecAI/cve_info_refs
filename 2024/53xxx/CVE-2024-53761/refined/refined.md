- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress WP Revisions Manager plugin <= 1.0.2 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious request and tricks an authenticated user into executing it (e.g., via a link or malicious website).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into submitting a malicious request. No specific position within the target network or system is required, although social engineering or similar techniques are necessary. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
