- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Essential Breadcrumbs plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website to trigger the unintended action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs to find a way to get a logged-in user to perform an action.
