Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-53131.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a null pointer dereference in the `touch_buffer()` function when called from `__nilfs_get_folio_block()` or `__nilfs_get_page_block()` within the nilfs2 filesystem. This occurs because the `touch_buffer()` function accesses the `dev_t` member `bh->b_bdev->bd_dev` of a buffer head (`bh`) before the `block_device` structure is properly set.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The `touch_buffer()` function attempts to access a member of a structure pointer (`bh->b_bdev`) that might be NULL.
- Race Condition: The `block_device` structure is set after the `touch_buffer()` is called from nilfs2 code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: The null pointer dereference can cause a kernel crash, resulting in a denial-of-service.
- General protection fault: When KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer) is enabled, it triggers a general protection fault.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by using the "block:block_touch_buffer" tracepoint in conjunction with nilfs2.
- Specifically, the vulnerable code is in the `__nilfs_get_folio_block` and `__nilfs_get_page_block` functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to trigger the "block:block_touch_buffer" tracepoint while interacting with the nilfs2 filesystem.
- This typically involves having the ability to mount and perform operations on a nilfs2 filesystem.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Ubisectech Sirius and syzbot.
- The fix involves removing the call to `touch_buffer()` in the affected functions of nilfs2 (`__nilfs_get_folio_block` and `__nilfs_get_page_block`). This is because the folio/page is marked as accessed in the common search helper function so there is no need to call touch_buffer().
- The fix was backported to several stable kernel branches as indicated by the multiple commits provided.
