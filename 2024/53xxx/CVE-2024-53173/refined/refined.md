{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A use-after-free vulnerability occurs in the NFSv4.0 client when two threads concurrently open files and are forced to abort before receiving a reply. The `nfs_release_seqid()` call within `nfs4_opendata_free()` can lead to a use-after-free condition on the RPC task pointer of the other thread.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper handling of RPC task cleanup in asynchronous open operations.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves multiple threads attempting to open files concurrently via NFSv4.0, with the connection being forced to abort before replies are received.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger concurrent file open operations over NFSv4.0 and be able to force abort connections while open operations are in progress."
