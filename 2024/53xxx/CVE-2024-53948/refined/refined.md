- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The generation of error messages in Apache Superset before version 4.1.0 includes sensitive analytics metadata information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Error messages are overly verbose and expose internal data that should not be accessible to unauthorized users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The exposure of analytics metadata could potentially lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security compromises.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially trigger an error in Superset that would lead to the generation of verbose error messages, thereby revealing the sensitive information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application in a way that triggers error messages. No specific position or authentication level is mentioned beyond needing to trigger an error.
