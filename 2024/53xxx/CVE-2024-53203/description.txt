In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: fix potential array underflow in ucsi_ccg_sync_control()

The "command" variable can be controlled by the user via debugfs.  The
worry is that if con_index is zero then "&uc->ucsi->connector[con_index
- 1]" would be an array underflow.
