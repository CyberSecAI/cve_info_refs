The provided content relates to CVE-2024-53068.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `scmi_dev->name` is freed prematurely in `__scmi_device_destroy()`, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability when `scmi_dev->name` is accessed later in `scmi_bus_notifier()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The memory pointed to by `scmi_dev->name` is freed, and later accessed causing a memory safety issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: The use-after-free causes a kernel crash detected by KASAN.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered during device unregistration when a device using the System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) is removed or destroyed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to trigger the removal/destruction of a SCMI device to trigger the vulnerable code path. This would most likely occur locally. The provided crash information shows this is occurring during system initialization.

**Additional details:**
- The fix moves the freeing of `scmi_dev->name` from `__scmi_device_destroy()` to `scmi_device_release()`, ensuring that the memory is not freed before the notification functions are called.
- The vulnerability was found using Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASAN).
- The stack trace provided in the commit message gives a detailed overview of the vulnerable code path and the state of the system at the time of the crash.
