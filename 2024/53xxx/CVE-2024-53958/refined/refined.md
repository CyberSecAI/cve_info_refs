- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), with a low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges required (PR:N), and requires user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to entice a user to open a malicious file, triggerring the vulnerability locally on the system.
