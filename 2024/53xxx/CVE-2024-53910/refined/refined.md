The provided content is related to CVE-2024-53910.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability present in the .NET Remoting services used by Veritas Enterprise Vault, Discovery Accelerator, and Compliance Accelerator/Veritas Surveillance. The .NET Remoting service listens on random TCP ports for commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Deserialization of untrusted data in .NET Remoting services.
- Unsecured TCP and local IPC services
- Randomly generated dynamic ports that are not properly secured
- Lack of proper firewall configuration

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the affected servers.
- Full compromise of the server, as indicated by the CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8 with high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks exploiting the .NET Remoting TCP ports.
- Local IPC exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- RDP access to a VM on the same network as the target server (attacker needs to be part of the Remote Desktop Users group)
- Knowledge of the target serverâ€™s IP address, process IDs, dynamic TCP ports, and remoteable object URIs.
- The target server firewall must be improperly configured to allow the malicious connection.
