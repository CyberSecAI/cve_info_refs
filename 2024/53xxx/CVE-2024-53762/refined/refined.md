- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to force actions on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions with their current authentication. Specific impacts vary on a case-by-case basis but could include modification of appointment booking settings, user data manipulation, or other administrative tasks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious request that is sent to the vulnerable website and triggered by a logged-in user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to click on a malicious link or open a malicious page, which executes the crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target website.
