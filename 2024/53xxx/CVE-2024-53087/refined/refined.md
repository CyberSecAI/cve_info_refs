The provided content is related to CVE-2024-53087.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing reference drop of the exec queue in the `xe_exec_ioctl` function within the Intel GPU DRM driver. Specifically, if the IOCTL returns an error due to invalid input such as `EXEC_QUEUE_FLAG_VM` flag being set, or an incorrect `num_batch_buffer` value, the exec queue reference count is not decremented, which could lead to a resource leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a resource leak. The `xe_exec_ioctl` function, after acquiring a reference to the exec queue, fails to release it upon encountering certain input errors.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact is a resource leak. Repeatedly triggering this condition could lead to exhaustion of available resources (exec queues in this case), potentially degrading system performance or leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending specific, malformed IOCTL requests to the `xe_exec_ioctl` function that trigger the error conditions (e.g. setting the `EXEC_QUEUE_FLAG_VM` flag or providing a mismatched number of batch buffers).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to interact with the DRM subsystem, typically requiring local access to the system. The attacker also needs to have the capability to send specific IOCTL commands and crafting the necessary input structures to trigger the faulty logic.
