Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The GitHub CLI (`gh`) incorrectly treats non-GitHub.com and non-ghe.com hosts as GitHub Enterprise Server hosts when cloning repositories with submodules, leading to the exposure of authentication tokens.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `gh` CLI commands `gh repo clone`, `gh repo fork`, and `gh pr checkout` invoke `git` with instructions to retrieve authentication tokens using the `credential.helper` configuration for any encountered host, including non-GitHub hosts.
- Prior to version `2.63.0`, `gh` incorrectly sourced tokens from environment variables (`GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, and `GITHUB_TOKEN` when `CODESPACES` is set) for non-GitHub hosts, treating them as GitHub Enterprise Server instances.
- Git may then send these tokens to the submodule host during cloning.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Leaked authentication tokens could be used by a third party to access privileged resources on the non-GitHub submodule host.

**Attack vectors:**
- Cloning a repository with a submodule hosted on a non-GitHub domain using the vulnerable `gh` commands.
- The attacker would need to control or compromise a git repository, with a submodule pointing to a server under their control.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create or control a git repository with submodules hosted on a non-GitHub server.
- The attacker needs a victim to clone the repository using vulnerable versions of the `gh` tool.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in `gh` version `2.63.0` by limiting the hosts for which `gh` acts as a credential helper and by restricting the usage of `GITHUB_TOKEN` to GitHub.com and ghe.com.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5 (Moderate severity).
- The attack vector is local, but the impact involves high confidentiality and integrity issues.
