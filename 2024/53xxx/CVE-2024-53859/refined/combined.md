Warning

Treat your access tokens like passwords. For more information, see [Keeping your personal access tokens secure](#keeping-your-personal-access-tokens-secure).

## [About personal access tokens](#about-personal-access-tokens)

Personal access tokens are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to GitHub Enterprise Cloud when using the [GitHub API](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/rest/overview/authenticating-to-the-rest-api) or the [command line](#using-a-personal-access-token-on-the-command-line).

Personal access tokens are intended to access GitHub resources on behalf of yourself. To access resources on behalf of an organization, or for long-lived integrations, you should use a GitHub App. For more information, see [About creating GitHub Apps](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/about-creating-github-apps).

A token has the same capabilities to access resources and perform actions on those resources that the owner of the token has, and is further limited by any scopes or permissions granted to the token. A token cannot grant additional access capabilities to a user. For example, a personal access token can be configured with an `admin:org` scope, but if the owner of the token is not an organization owner, the token will not give administrative access to the organization.

### [Types of personal access tokens](#types-of-personal-access-tokens)

GitHub currently supports two types of personal access tokens: fine-grained personal access tokens and personal access tokens (classic). GitHub recommends that you use fine-grained personal access tokens instead of personal access tokens (classic) whenever possible.

Both fine-grained personal access tokens and personal access tokens (classic) are tied to the user who generated them and will become inactive if the user loses access to the resource.

Organization owners can set a policy to restrict the access of personal access tokens (classic) to their organization, and enterprise owners can restrict the access of personal access tokens (classic) to the enterprise or organizations owned by the enterprise. For more information, see [Setting a personal access token policy for your organization](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization#restricting-access-by-personal-access-tokens).

#### [Fine-grained personal access tokens](#fine-grained-personal-access-tokens)

Fine-grained personal access tokens have several security advantages over personal access tokens (classic):

* Each token can only access resources owned by a single user or organization.
* Each token can only access specific repositories.
* Each token is granted specific permissions, which offer more control than the scopes granted to personal access tokens (classic).
* Organization owners can require approval for any fine-grained personal access tokens that can access resources in the organization.
* Enterprise owners can require approval for any fine-grained personal access tokens that can access resources in organizations owned by the enterprise.

#### [Personal access tokens (classic)](#personal-access-tokens-classic)

Personal access tokens (classic) are less secure. However, some features currently will only work with personal access tokens (classic):

* Only personal access tokens (classic) have write access for public repositories that are not owned by you or an organization that you are not a member of.
* Only personal access tokens (classic) automatically have write access for internal repositories that are owned by your enterprise. Fine-grained personal access tokens must be granted access to internal repositories.
* Outside collaborators can only use personal access tokens (classic) to access organization repositories that they are a collaborator on.
* Only personal access tokens (classic) can access enterprises. (Fine-grained personal access token can access organizations owned by enterprises.)
* A few REST API endpoints are only available with a personal access tokens (classic). To check whether an endpoint also supports fine-grained personal access tokens, see the documentation for that endpoint, or see [Endpoints available for fine-grained personal access tokens](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/rest/overview/endpoints-available-for-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens).

If you choose to use a personal access token (classic), keep in mind that it will grant access to all repositories within the organizations that you have access to, as well as all personal repositories in your personal account.

As a security precaution, GitHub automatically removes personal access tokens that haven't been used in a year. To provide additional security, we highly recommend adding an expiration to your personal access tokens.

### [Keeping your personal access tokens secure](#keeping-your-personal-access-tokens-secure)

Personal access tokens are like passwords, and they share the same inherent security risks. Before creating a new personal access token, consider if there is a more secure method of authentication available to you:

* To access GitHub from the command line, you can use [GitHub CLI](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli) or [Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/blob/main/README.md) instead of creating a personal access token.
* When using a personal access token in a GitHub Actions workflow, consider whether you can use the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` instead. For more information, see [Automatic token authentication](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).

If these options are not possible, and you must create a personal access token, consider using another CLI service to store your token securely.

When using a personal access token in a script, you can store your token as a secret and run your script through GitHub Actions. For more information, see [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets). You can also store your token as a Codespaces secret and run your script in Codespaces. For more information, see [Managing your account-specific secrets for GitHub Codespaces](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-codespaces).

For more information about best practices, see [Keeping your API credentials secure](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/rest/overview/keeping-your-api-credentials-secure).

## [Creating a fine-grained personal access token](#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)

Note

Fine-grained personal access token are currently in public preview and subject to change. To leave feedback, see [the feedback discussion](https://github.com/community/community/discussions/36441).

1. [Verify your email address](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address), if it hasn't been verified yet.
2. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  **Settings**.
3. In the left sidebar, click  **Developer settings**.
4. In the left sidebar, under  **Personal access tokens**, click **Fine-grained tokens**.
5. Click **Generate new token**.
6. Under **Token name**, enter a name for the token.
7. Under **Expiration**, select an expiration for the token. Infinite lifetimes are allowed but may be blocked by a maximum lifetime policy set by your organization or enterprise owner. For more information, See [Enforcing a maximum lifetime policy for personal access tokens](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization#enforcing-a-maximum-lifetime-policy-for-personal-access-tokens).
8. Optionally, under **Description**, add a note to describe the purpose of the token.
9. Under **Resource owner**, select a resource owner. The token will only be able to access resources owned by the selected resource owner. Organizations that you are a member of will not appear unless the organization opted in to fine-grained personal access tokens. For more information, see [Setting a personal access token policy for your organization](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization). You may be required to perform single sign-on (SSO) if the selected organization requires it and you do not already have an active session.
10. Optionally, if the resource owner is an organization that requires approval for fine-grained personal access tokens, below the resource owner, in the box, enter a justification for the request.
11. Under **Repository access**, select which repositories you want the token to access. You should choose the minimal repository access that meets your needs. Tokens always include read-only access to all public repositories on GitHub.
12. If you selected **Only select repositories** in the previous step, under the **Selected repositories** dropdown, select the repositories that you want the token to access.
13. Under **Permissions**, select which permissions to grant the token. Depending on which resource owner and which repository access you specified, there are repository, organization, and account permissions. You should choose the minimal permissions necessary for your needs.

    The REST API reference document for each endpoint states whether the endpoint works with fine-grained personal access tokens and states what permissions are required in order for the token to use the endpoint. Some endpoints may require multiple permissions, and some endpoints may require one of multiple permissions. For an overview of which REST API endpoints a fine-grained personal access token can access with each permission, see [Permissions required for fine-grained personal access tokens](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens).
14. Click **Generate token**.

If you selected an organization as the resource owner and the organization requires approval for fine-grained personal access tokens, then your token will be marked as `pending` until it is reviewed by an organization administrator. Your token will only be able to read public resources until it is approved. If you are an owner of the organization, your request is automatically approved. For more information, see [Reviewing and revoking personal access tokens in your organization](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/reviewing-and-revoking-personal-access-tokens-in-your-organization).

## [Creating a personal access token (classic)](#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)

Note

Organization owners can restrict the access of personal access token (classic) to their organization. If you try to use a personal access token (classic) to access resources in an organization that has disabled personal access token (classic) access, your request will fail with a 403 response. Instead, you must use a GitHub App, OAuth app, or fine-grained personal access token.

Warning

Your personal access token (classic) can access every repository that you can access. GitHub recommends that you use fine-grained personal access tokens instead, which you can restrict to specific repositories. Fine-grained personal access tokens also enable you to specify fine-grained permissions instead of broad scopes.

1. [Verify your email address](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address), if it hasn't been verified yet.
2. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  **Settings**.
3. In the left sidebar, click  **Developer settings**.
4. In the left sidebar, under  **Personal access tokens**, click **Tokens (classic)**.
5. Select **Generate new token**, then click **Generate new token (classic)**.
6. In the "Note" field, give your token a descriptive name.
7. To give your token an expiration, select **Expiration**, then choose a default option or click **Custom** to enter a date.
8. Select the scopes you'd like to grant this token. To use your token to access repositories from the command line, select **repo**. A token with no assigned scopes can only access public information. For more information, see [Scopes for OAuth apps](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes).
9. Click **Generate token**.
10. Optionally, to copy the new token to your clipboard, click .

    ![Screenshot of the "Personal access tokens" page. Next to a blurred-out token, an icon of two overlapping squares is outlined in orange.](/assets/cb-17251/images/help/settings/personal-access-tokens.png)
11. To use your token to access resources owned by an organization that uses SAML single sign-on, authorize the token. For more information, see [Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).

## [Deleting a personal access token](#deleting-a-personal-access-token)

You should delete a personal access token if it is no longer needed. If you delete a personal access token that was used to create a deploy key, the deploy key will also be deleted.

1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  **Settings**.
2. In the left sidebar, click  **Developer settings**.
3. In the left sidebar, under  **Personal access tokens**, click either **Fine-grained tokens** or **Tokens (classic)**, depending on which type of personal access token you'd like to delete.
4. To the right of the personal access token you want to delete, click **Delete**.

## [Using a personal access token on the command line](#using-a-personal-access-token-on-the-command-line)

Once you have a personal access token, you can enter it instead of your password when performing Git operations over HTTPS.

For example, to clone a repository on the command line you would enter the following `git clone` command. You would then be prompted to enter your username and password. When prompted for your password, enter your personal access token instead of a password.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git
Username: YOUR-USERNAME
Password: YOUR-PERSONAL-ACCESS-TOKEN

```

Personal access tokens can only be used for HTTPS Git operations. If your repository uses an SSH remote URL, you will need to [switch the remote from SSH to HTTPS](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories#switching-remote-urls-from-ssh-to-https).

If you are not prompted for your username and password, your credentials may be cached on your computer. You can [update your credentials in the Keychain](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/get-started/getting-started-with-git/updating-credentials-from-the-macos-keychain) to replace your old password with the token.

Instead of manually entering your personal access token for every HTTPS Git operation, you can cache your personal access token with a Git client. Git will temporarily store your credentials in memory until an expiry interval has passed. You can also store the token in a plain text file that Git can read before every request. For more information, see [Caching your GitHub credentials in Git](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git).

# `auth.TokenForHost` violates GitHub host security boundary when sourcing authentication token within a codespace

Moderate

[andyfeller](/andyfeller)
published
GHSA-55v3-xh23-96gh
Nov 27, 2024

## Package

gomod

github.com/cli/go-gh/v2
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= 2.11.0

## Patched versions

2.11.1

## Description

### Summary

A security vulnerability has been identified in `go-gh` that could leak authentication tokens intended for GitHub hosts to non-GitHub hosts when within a codespace.

### Details

`go-gh` sources authentication tokens from different environment variables depending on the host involved:

* `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` for GitHub.com and ghe.com
* `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` for GitHub Enterprise Server

Prior to `2.11.1`, `auth.TokenForHost` could source a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for a host other than GitHub.com or ghe.com when [within a codespace](https://github.com/cli/go-gh/blob/71770357e0cb12867d3e3e288854c0aa09d440b7/pkg/auth/auth.go#L73-L77).

In `2.11.1`, `auth.TokenForHost` will only source a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for GitHub.com or ghe.com hosts.

### Impact

Successful exploitation could send authentication token to an unintended host.

### Remediation and mitigation

1. Upgrade `go-gh` to `2.11.1`
2. Advise extension users to regenerate authentication tokens:
   * [Personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
   * [GitHub CLI OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/reviewing-and-revoking-authorization-of-github-apps#reviewing-your-authorized-github-apps)
3. Advise extension users to review their personal [security log](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-security-log) and any relevant [audit logs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/identifying-audit-log-events-performed-by-an-access-token) for actions associated with their account or enterprise

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Identifying audit log events performed by an access token

You can identify the actions performed by a specific token in your enterprise.

## In this article

## [About token data in the audit log for an enterprise](#about-token-data-in-the-audit-log-for-an-enterprise)

Your enterprise's audit log contains an event for each action that a user or integration performs. If the action occurred outside of GitHub's web UI, the event's data will show details about how the user or integration authenticated.

If you learn that a token was compromised, you can understand the actions taken by the compromised token by searching the audit log for all events associated with that token.

Token data appears in the audit log for the following authentication methods.

* Personal access token
* OAuth token
* GitHub Apps (authentication as an app installation or on behalf of a user)
* Deploy key
* SSH key

Note

Display of token data for SSH keys and deploy keys in the audit log is in public preview and subject to change.

## [Token data in audit log events](#token-data-in-audit-log-events)

The following data about token use appears in the audit log to help you understand how the user or integration authenticated.

| Information | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `hashed_token` | SHA-256 hash of the token used for authentication. |
| `programmatic_access_type` | Type of authentication used. |
| `token_scopes` | If applicable, the scopes for the token. |

## [Identifying events associated with a token](#identifying-events-associated-with-a-token)

To identify events associated with a specific token, you can use the UI or REST API. To identify Git events, you'll need to export the events from the audit log. To identify any events, you will need to know the SHA-256 hash of the token first.

* [Generating a SHA-256 hash value for a token](#generating-a-sha-256-hash-value-for-a-token)
* [Searching on GitHub](#searching-on-github)
* [Searching with the REST API](#searching-with-the-rest-api)
* [Identifying Git events](#identifying-git-events)

### [Generating a SHA-256 hash value for a token](#generating-a-sha-256-hash-value-for-a-token)

If you only have a raw token value, you'll need to generate a SHA-256 hash before you can search for the token.

For macOS and Linux, you can use `echo -n TOKEN | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64`, replacing TOKEN with the token value.

For Powershell, you can use the following script to return a SHA-256 hash for a given string.

Shell
```
Param (
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]
    $ClearString
)

$hasher = [System.Security.Cryptography.HashAlgorithm]::Create('sha256')
$hash = $hasher.ComputeHash([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($ClearString))

$hashString = [System.BitConverter]::ToString($hash)
$hashString.Replace('-', '')

```
```
Param (
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]
    $ClearString
)
$hasher = [System.Security.Cryptography.HashAlgorithm]::Create('sha256')
$hash = $hasher.ComputeHash([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($ClearString))
$hashString = [System.BitConverter]::ToString($hash)
$hashString.Replace('-', '')

```
### [Searching on GitHub](#searching-on-github)

While searching the audit log on GitHub, include `hashed_token:"VALUE"` in your search query, replacing `VALUE` with the SHA-256 hash of the token.

Note

Make sure to wrap the hashed token value in quotation marks.

Searches using GitHub do not return Git events.

### [Searching with the REST API](#searching-with-the-rest-api)

Before you can search for a token using the REST API, after you generate a SHA-256 hash, you also need to URI-escape the hash. Most major programming languages provide a utility for URI escaping. For example, [encodeURIComponent()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) encodes a string for JavaScript.

Then, include `hashed_token:"VALUE"` in your search phrase, replacing VALUE with the URI-escaped hash.

Searches using the REST API do not return Git events.

For example, if the name of the enterprise account is `octo-corp`, the following curl command would search @octo-corp's audit log for all events that are associated with the token whose URI-encoded SHA-256 hash is `EH4L8o6PfCqipALbL%2BQT62lyqUtnI7ql0SPbkaQnjv8`.

```
curl --header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" --header "X-GitHub-Api-Version:2022-11-28" 'https://api.github.com/enterprises/octo-corp/audit-log?phrase=hashed_token:"EH4L8o6PfCqipALbL%2BQT62lyqUtnI7ql0SPbkaQnjv8"'

```
### [Identifying Git events](#identifying-git-events)

You can identify Git events authenticated with a specific token. When you export Git event data from the audit log, fields with details about authentication appear in the output. For more information, see [Exporting audit log activity for your enterprise](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/admin/monitoring-activity-in-your-enterprise/reviewing-audit-logs-for-your-enterprise/exporting-audit-log-activity-for-your-enterprise#exporting-git-events-data).

Note

Display of token data for Git events in the audit log is in public preview and subject to change.

# Reviewing your security log

You can review the security log for your personal account to better understand actions you've performed and actions others have performed that involve you.

## In this article

* [Accessing your security log](#accessing-your-security-log)
* [Searching your security log](#searching-your-security-log)
* [Exporting your security log](#exporting-your-security-log)
## [Accessing your security log](#accessing-your-security-log)

The security log lists all actions performed within the last 90 days.

1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  **Settings**.
2. In the "Archives" section of the sidebar, click  **Security log**.

## [Searching your security log](#searching-your-security-log)

The name for each audit log entry is composed of a category of events, followed by an operation type. For example, the `repo.create` entry refers to the `create` operation on the `repo` category.

Each audit log entry shows applicable information about an event, such as:

* The organization an action was performed in
* The user (actor) who performed the action
* The user affected by the action
* Which repository an action was performed in
* The action that was performed
* Which country the action took place in
* The date and time the action occurred

Note that you cannot search for entries using text. You can, however, construct search queries using a variety of filters. Many operators used when querying the log, such as `-`, `>`, or `<`, match the same format as searching across GitHub. For more information, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github).

### [Search based on operation](#search-based-on-operation)

Use the `operation` qualifier to limit actions to specific types of operations. For example:

* `operation:access` finds all events where a resource was accessed.
* `operation:authentication` finds all events where an authentication event was performed.
* `operation:create` finds all events where a resource was created.
* `operation:modify` finds all events where an existing resource was modified.
* `operation:remove` finds all events where an existing resource was removed.
* `operation:restore` finds all events where an existing resource was restored.
* `operation:transfer` finds all events where an existing resource was transferred.

### [Search based on repository](#search-based-on-repository)

Use the `repo` qualifier to limit actions to a specific repository. For example:

* `repo:my-org/our-repo` finds all events that occurred for the `our-repo` repository in the `my-org` organization.
* `repo:my-org/our-repo repo:my-org/another-repo` finds all events that occurred for both the `our-repo` and `another-repo` repositories in the `my-org` organization.
* `-repo:my-org/not-this-repo` excludes all events that occurred for the `not-this-repo` repository in the `my-org` organization.

Note that you must include the account name within the `repo` qualifier; searching for just `repo:our-repo` will not work.

### [Search based on the user](#search-based-on-the-user)

The `actor` qualifier can scope events based on who performed the action. For example:

* `actor:octocat` finds all events performed by `octocat`.
* `actor:octocat actor:hubot` finds all events performed by `octocat` or `hubot`.
* `-actor:hubot` excludes all events performed by `hubot`.

Note that you can only use a GitHub username, not an individual's real name.

### [Search based on the action performed](#search-based-on-the-action-performed)

The events listed in your security log are triggered by your actions. Actions are grouped into different categories. For the full list of events in each category, see [Security log events](/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/security-log-events).

## [Exporting your security log](#exporting-your-security-log)

You can export the log as JSON data or a comma-separated value (CSV) file with the **Export** dropdown menu.

To filter the results in your export, search by one or more of these supported qualifiers before using the **Export** dropdown menu.

| Qualifier | Example value |
| --- | --- |
| `action` | team.create |
| `actor` | octocat |
| `user` | codertocat |
| `org` | octo-org |
| `repo` | octo-org/documentation |
| `created` | 2019-06-01 |
| After you export the log, you'll see the following keys and values in the resulting file. |  |

| Key | Example value |
| --- | --- |
| `action` | team.create |
| `actor` | octocat |
| `user` | codertocat |
| `actor_location.country_code` | US |
| `org` | octo-org |
| `repo` | octo-org/documentation |

# Reviewing and revoking authorization of GitHub Apps

You can review the GitHub Apps that you have authorized, and you can revoke your authorization.

## In this article

* [About authorized GitHub Apps](#about-authorized-github-apps)
* [Reviewing your authorized GitHub Apps](#reviewing-your-authorized-github-apps)
* [Further reading](#further-reading)
## [About authorized GitHub Apps](#about-authorized-github-apps)

You may authorize a GitHub App to give the app permission to access information on your GitHub account and to act on your behalf. For more information, see [Authorizing GitHub Apps](/en/apps/using-github-apps/authorizing-github-apps).

You should periodically review the GitHub Apps that you have authorized. If you no longer use an app, consider revoking your authorization for that app.

The authorization can only be revoked by the person who authorized the GitHub App. Organization owners cannot revoke GitHub App authorizations for their organization members. However, organization owners can uninstall the GitHub App from their organization, which will prevent the app from accessing organization-owned resources. For more information, see [Reviewing and modifying installed GitHub Apps](/en/apps/using-github-apps/reviewing-and-modifying-installed-github-apps).

## [Reviewing your authorized GitHub Apps](#reviewing-your-authorized-github-apps)

1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  **Settings**.
2. In the "Integrations" section of the sidebar, click  **Applications**.
3. Click the **Authorized GitHub Apps** tab.
4. Review the GitHub Apps that have access to your account. For those that you don't recognize or that have not been used recently, click **Revoke**. To revoke your authorization for all GitHub Apps, click **Revoke all**.

   ![Screenshot of the "Authorized GitHub Apps" tab. Next to an app, a button, labeled "Revoke," is highlighted in orange.](/assets/cb-56741/images/help/settings/revoke-github-app.png)
