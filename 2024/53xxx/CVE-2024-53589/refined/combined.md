## Buffer Overflow in GNU Binutils objdump tekhex Parser

* Vulnerability Type: Buffer Overflow
* Vendor: GNU Project
* Product: GNU Binutils
* Version Affected: 2.43 and potentially earlier versions
* Fix Status: Fixed in commit e0323071916878e0634a6e24d8250e4faff67e88

## Description

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in GNU Binutils’ objdump utility when processing tekhex format files. The vulnerability occurs in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library’s tekhex parser during format identification. Specifically, the issue manifests when attempting to read 8 bytes at an address that precedes the global variable ‘\_bfd\_std\_section’, resulting in an out-of-bounds read.

## Technical Details

The vulnerability triggers a global buffer overflow with the following characteristics:

1. Memory Access:

* Type: READ operation
* Size: 8 bytes
* Location: 8 bytes before global variable ‘\*bfd\_std\_section’
* Variable Definition: Located in ‘section.c:777’

2. Memory Layout:

* Vulnerable address is located:
  + 8 bytes before `*bfd_std_section` (size 1120 bytes)
  + 64 bytes after `bfd_plugin_canonicalize_symtab.fake_common_section` (size 280 bytes)

```
bfd_get_next_section_by_name (section.c:940)
→ first_phase (tekhex.c:484)
→ pass_over (tekhex.c:554)
→ tekhex_object_p (tekhex.c:619)
→ bfd_check_format_matches (format.c:530)
→ display_object_bfd (objdump.c:5850)
→ display_any_bfd (objdump.c:5939)
→ display_file (objdump.c:5960)
→ main (objdump.c:6377)
```

The root cause stems from improper handling of the `bfd_abs_section` pointer in the `first_phase` function within `tekhex.c`. The code attempts to perform section traversal operations on `bfd_abs_section_ptr` without proper validation, leading to an invalid memory access.

## Impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious `tekhex` file that, when processed by `objdump`, triggers an out-of-bounds read. This could potentially:

1. Cause program crash through invalid memory access
2. Lead to information disclosure, potentially exposing memory addresses that could be used to defeat ASLR
3. Potentially allow for arbitrary code execution in specific circumstances

## Reproduction

The issue can be reproduced by:

1. Compiling binutils with Address Sanitizer (ASAN)
2. Running `objdump -a` on a specially crafted tekhex file

## Fix

The issue has been patched by adding proper validation checks in the first\_phase function to guard against modification of `_bfd_std_section[]` entries. The fix specifically addresses the handling of `bfd_abs_section` in the `tekhex parser`.

## GNU Binutils

The GNU Binutils are a collection of binary tools. The main
ones are:

* **ld** - the GNU linker.
* **as** - the GNU assembler.
* **gold** - a new, faster, ELF only linker.

But they also include:

* **addr2line** - Converts addresses into filenames and
  line numbers.
* **ar** - A utility for creating, modifying and
  extracting from archives.
* **c++filt** - Filter to demangle encoded C++
  symbols.
* **dlltool** - Creates files for building and using DLLs.
* **elfedit** - Allows alteration of ELF format files.
* **gprof** - Displays profiling information.
* **[gprofng](https://sourceware.org/binutils/wiki/gprofng)** - Collects and displays application performance data.
* **nlmconv** - Converts object code into an NLM.
* **nm** - Lists symbols from object files.
* **objcopy** - Copies and translates object files.
* **objdump** - Displays information from object
  files.
* **ranlib** - Generates an index to the contents of an
  archive.
* **readelf** - Displays information from any ELF format
  object file.
* **size** - Lists the section sizes of an object or
  archive file.
* **strings** - Lists printable strings from files.
* **strip** - Discards symbols.
* **windmc** - A Windows compatible message compiler.
* **windres** - A compiler for Windows resource
  files.

As well as some libraries:

* **libbfd** - A library for manipulating binary files in a variety of
  different formats.
* **libctf** - A library for manipulating the CTF debug format.
* **libopcodes** - A library for assembling and disassembling a variety
  of different assembler languages.
* **libsframe** - A library for manipulating the SFRAME debug format.

Most of these programs use **BFD**, the Binary File
Descriptor library, to do low-level manipulation. Many of them
also use the **opcodes** library to assemble and disassemble
machine instructions.

The binutils have been ported to most major Unix variants as
well as Wintel systems, and their main reason for existence is to
give the [GNU
system](/gnu/gnu-history.html) (and [GNU/Linux](/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html)) the facility to compile and link programs.

### Obtaining binutils

The latest release of GNU binutils is 2.43. The various NEWS files
([binutils](https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=blob_plain;f=binutils/NEWS;hb=refs/heads/binutils-2_43-branch),
[gas](https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=blob_plain;f=gas/NEWS;hb=refs/heads/binutils-2_43-branch), and
[ld](https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=blob_plain;f=ld/NEWS;hb=refs/heads/binutils-2_43-branch))
have details of what has changed in this release.

See the [SOFTWARE](/software/software.html#getgnu)
page for information on obtaining releases of GNU binutils and
other GNU software. The current release can be downloaded from
<https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils> or <https://sourceware.org/pub/binutils/releases/>.

If you plan to do active work on GNU binutils, you can access
the development source tree by anonymous git:

`git clone git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git`

Alternatively, you can use [the gitweb interface](http://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git), or the source snapshots, available as
compressed tar files from
<https://sourceware.org/pub/binutils/snapshots/>.

Releases are made from branches in the repository, and commits are often
made to the branches even after the release has gone out. The branches are
named **binutils-M\_NN-branch** where **M** is the major component of the
version number and **NN** is the minor component. So the 2.43 release for
example was taken from a branch called binutils-2\_43-branch.

Releases and branches are tagged as well. The point where a branch was
created is tagged as **binutils-M\_NN-branchpoint** and the point where a
release was created is tagged as **binutils-M\_NN**. So for example the
2.43 release branch was split from the master branch at
the binutils-2\_43-branchpoint tag and the 2.43 release was made from
that release at the binutils-2\_43 tag.

Due to an unfortunate mistake the tag for the 2.41 release was not set to
the correct location. Since this mistake was only discovered after the
release had gone out we decided not to move the tag, but instead create a new
one. Hence for the 2.41 release only, the release tag is
called **binutils-2\_41-official-release**.

### Bug reports

There is a bug-tracking system at <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/>.

Patches can be emailed to binutils@sourceware.org.
### Mailing lists

There are three binutils mailing lists:

bug-binutils@gnu.org
([archives](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-binutils/))
For reporting bugs.
binutils@sourceware.org
([archives](https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/))
For discussing binutils issues.
binutils-cvs ([archives](https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils-cvs/))
A read-only mailing list containing the notes from checkins
to the binutils git repository. (This list has an odd name for
historical reasons.)

To subscribe to the binutils@sourceware.org mailing list, see
[the binutils
mailing list page](https://sourceware.org/mailman/listinfo/binutils).

To subscribe to the bug-binutils@gnu.org mailing
list, see [the bug-binutils info page](http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-binutils).

You may wish to browse the old mail archives of the
[gas2](http://sourceware.org/ml/gas2/) and
[bfd](http://sourceware.org/ml/bfd/)
mailing lists. These were the discussion lists for binutils until
May 1999. Please do not send mail to them any longer.

### Documentation

* The [documentation for the current binutils release](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/) is available here.
* A [guide to
  porting the binutils](https://sourceware.org/binutils/binutils-porting-guide.txt) to a new target has been contributed.
* A [wiki for the GNU
  Binutils](https://sourceware.org/binutils/wiki/HomePage) contains more information about the project and the various tools
  that it contains.
* The GNU Binutils has a
  [Code
  of Conduct](https://sourceware.org/binutils/code-of-conduct/Code-of-Conduct.html) for anyone wishing to work with the project.

All of these documents are maintained in a
[git repository](https://sourceware.org/cgit/binutils-htdocs/),
which can be cloned via:

`git clone git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-htdocs`

*Note - there are two separate copies of this page. One is available at
[sourceware.org](https://sourceware.org/binutils/) and one
at [gnu.org](/software/binutils/). The sourceware version is
obtained from the git repository mentioned above. The gnu.org page is
