In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: qcom-pmic: init value of hdr_len/txbuf_len earlier

If the read of USB_PDPHY_RX_ACKNOWLEDGE_REG failed, then hdr_len and
txbuf_len are uninitialized. This commit stops to print uninitialized
value and misleading/false data.
