{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The UBI (Unsorted Block Images) subsystem's fast attach process could invoke the `alloc_ai()` function multiple times with the same slab cache name, `ubi_aeb_slab_cache`. This violates the kernel's requirement for unique slab cache names, leading to a warning being thrown when `DEBUG_VM` is enabled.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Duplicate slab cache names"
    ],
    "impact": "A kernel warning message is generated due to the duplicate slab cache name. Although the warning itself does not directly cause a functional issue, it is an indication of a flaw in resource management and could lead to further issues if not addressed.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the normal operation of the UBI subsystem when attaching a UBI device using the fastmap functionality. There is no specific attack vector, the issue arises from normal device initialization.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs no specific capabilities or position. The issue can be triggered by anyone loading a UBI device using fastmap. Enabling the `CONFIG_DEBUG_VM` kernel configuration option makes the issue visible via the kernel log."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix involves modifying the `alloc_ai()` function to accept a slab name as an argument, rather than using a hardcoded name.  Different slab names are now used when allocating the slab cache in different code paths."
