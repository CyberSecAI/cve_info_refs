The provided content relates to CVE-2024-53126.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the fact that in `psnet_open_pf_bar()` and `snet_open_vf_bar()`, a string used later by `pcim_iomap_regions()` is allocated on the stack. `pcim_iomap_regions()` does not copy this string, thus when the stack frame disappears, the string becomes invalid, causing undefined behavior if used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of stack-allocated memory for a string passed to a function that might use it later after the stack frame has been deallocated.
- Lack of proper memory management for the string used by `pcim_iomap_regions()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The exploitation leads to undefined behavior, which can result in crashes, unexpected program behavior, or potentially other vulnerabilities due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered during the normal operation of the Solidrun DPU driver when opening a PCI BAR, no specific malicious actions or specific configuration/setup needed to trigger the vulnerability other than using the affected code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to use the affected driver code.
