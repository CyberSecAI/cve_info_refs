# Ansible collection "ibm.ibm\_zhmc" has passwords in clear text in log file and in output of some modules when specified as input

High

[andy-maier](/andy-maier)
published
GHSA-mw6c-f428-jx4f
Nov 29, 2024

## Package

ibm.ibm\_zhmc
(Ansible)

## Affected versions

<1.9.3

## Patched versions

1.9.3

## Description

### Impact

The Ansible collection "ibm.ibm\_zhmc" writes password-like properties in clear text into its log file and into the output returned by some of its Ansible modules in the following cases:

* The 'boot\_ftp\_password' or 'ssc\_master\_pw' properties are passed as input to the zhmc\_partition Ansible module
* The 'ssc\_master\_pw' or 'zaware\_master\_pw' properties are passed as input to the zhmc\_lpar Ansible module
* The 'password' property is passed as input to the zhmc\_user Ansible module (just in log file, not in module output)
* The 'bind\_password' property is passed as input to the zhmc\_ldap\_server\_definition Ansible module

These properties appear in the module output only when they were specified in the module input and when creating or updating the corresponding resources. They do not appear in the output when they were not specified in the module input or when retrieving facts for the corresponding resources.

A log file is created only when the "log\_file" module input parameter of the Ansible modules is used. By default, no log file is created.

### Patches

Has been fixed in ibm.ibm\_zhmc version 1.9.3.

### Workarounds

Not applicable, since fix is available.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

```
Details:

* Increased minimum version of zhmcclient to 1.8.2 to pick up fixes for no
  longer logging password-like properties in clear-text.

* Fixed that all password-like input parameters that were written in clear text
  to the module entry log are now blanked out. This affected the following
  modules: zhmc_ldap_server_definition, zhmc_lpar, zhmc_partition, zhmc_user.

* Fixed that all password-like input parameters that were added to the
  module return value in clear text for 'state' values that created or updated
  the resource are now removed from the return value. This affected the
  following modules: zhmc_ldap_server_definition, zhmc_lpar, zhmc_partition.

* The 'hmc_auth' input parameter is no longer completely removed from the
  module entry log, but instead its sensitive items 'password' and 'session_id'
  are now blanked out.

* In support of the above, added common functions blanked_params(),
  blanked_dict() and removed_dict(). Added unit tests for these new functions.

* Improved the end2end tests for the affected modules to check that the module
  output does not contain the password-like properties.
