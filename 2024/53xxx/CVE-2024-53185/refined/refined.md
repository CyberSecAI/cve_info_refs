Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-53185.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing initialization of the `server->cipher_type` field for SMB3.02 connections within the Linux kernel's CIFS client. Specifically, when the `SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_ENCRYPTION` flag is set in the negotiate response, the client should use AES-128-CCM as the default cipher. However, a previous fix (`b0abcd65ec54`) added a check for `server->cipher_type` before allocating resources for encryption but failed to initialize the cipher type for SMB3.02 connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** When encryption is enabled with SMB3.02, the `server->cipher_type` remains uninitialized (NULL). Consequently, when `crypto_aead_setkey` is called later to establish encryption, a null pointer dereference occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash:** A successful exploitation leads to a kernel crash due to the null pointer dereference. This is evident from the KASAN report provided. The kernel crash can lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Mount:** The attack vector involves a malicious or misconfigured SMB server that signals encryption support during negotiation with an SMB3.02 client, causing the kernel to crash when it attempts to initialize the encryption mechanism.
- **Mount Command:** The vulnerability is triggered when mounting a CIFS share using the `mount.cifs` command with the `vers=3.02` option and the `seal` option (enabling encryption).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to set up an SMB server and be reachable by the vulnerable client. The attacker has to control the SMB server's responses during negotiation.
- **Mount Trigger:** The attacker does not need any specific local capability. A user on a local system with the ability to mount network shares can trigger the vulnerability.

The provided patches correct the issue by explicitly setting the `server->cipher_type` to `SMB2_ENCRYPTION_AES128_CCM` for SMB3.02 connections in addition to SMB3.0 connections, thus preventing the null pointer dereference.
