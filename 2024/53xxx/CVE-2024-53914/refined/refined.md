This document provides information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2024-53914.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the deserialization of untrusted data within the .NET Remoting service used by Veritas Enterprise Vault. The application starts services listening on random TCP ports which are vulnerable to attacks inherent to .NET Remoting.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Deserialization of untrusted data in .NET Remoting services.
-  TCP ports listening for commands from client applications that are vulnerable due to the .NET Remoting service.
-  Exploitable TCP remoting and local IPC services.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the vulnerable Enterprise Vault, Discovery Accelerator, and Compliance Accelerator/Veritas Surveillance Server.
- Complete compromise of the affected servers (confidentiality, integrity, and availability).

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted data to a vulnerable EV server via .NET Remoting services.
- Exploiting TCP remoting services and local IPC services.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- RDP access to a VM within the network where the EV server resides (attacker needs to be part of the Remote Desktop Users group).
- Knowledge of the EV server IP address, EV process IDs, EV TCP dynamic ports, and EV remoteable object URIs.
- Improperly configured firewall on the EV server.

This document provides more detail than the CVE description by specifying that the vulnerability lies in the .NET Remoting services, specifying the required attacker capabilities and the conditions that must be met for the vulnerability to be exploited. It also mentions that this vulnerability affects multiple Veritas products including Enterprise Vault, Discovery Accelerator, and Compliance Accelerator/Veritas Surveillance.
