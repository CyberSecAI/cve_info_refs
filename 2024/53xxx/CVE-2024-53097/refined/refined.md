The provided content relates to CVE-2024-53097.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the `__do_krealloc` function in the Linux kernel's memory management subsystem. Specifically, when zeroing out spare memory after a `krealloc` operation, the code didn't reset the KASAN tag before calling `memset`, leading to a mismatch between the pointer tag and the memory tag. This mismatch caused a false positive slab-out-of-bounds error when using Memory Tagging Extension (MTE). The root cause is a lack of consideration for MTE when zeroing spare memory with `memset`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The code was not MTE aware.
- Improper handling of KASAN tags during memory initialization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is a false positive slab-out-of-bounds error reported by KASAN when MTE is enabled, leading to kernel panics. The vulnerability does not allow an attacker to corrupt memory or perform other harmful actions. It merely triggers a false positive, crashing the system.
- The false positive can interfere with the normal operation of the kernel.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the execution of a `krealloc` operation when spare memory needs to be zeroed and the `want_init_on_alloc` flag is enabled (typically when `__GFP_ZERO` flag is passed).
- The vulnerability does not require any specific user interaction; it can occur during normal kernel operations that involve dynamic memory reallocation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would not need any special position, the allocation of memory would cause the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not require any capabilities other than normal system use that triggers memory allocations with `__GFP_ZERO`.
