- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cowidgets â€“ Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin is susceptible to XSS, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack can lead to the execution of malicious scripts on the website when users visit the site. This could result in redirects, advertisements, or the injection of other HTML payloads, potentially compromising user data and website integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it is likely through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized by the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need the ability to inject malicious scripts into the website, which can often be done through forms, or other user-facing input fields. The required privilege is listed as "Contributor," meaning the attacker likely requires that level of access to exploit the vulnerability.
