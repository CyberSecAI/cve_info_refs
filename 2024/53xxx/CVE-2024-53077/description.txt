In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rpcrdma: Always release the rpcrdma_device's xa_array

Dai pointed out that the xa_init_flags() in rpcrdma_add_one() needs
to have a matching xa_destroy() in rpcrdma_remove_one() to release
underlying memory that the xarray might have accrued during
operation.
