# Synapse can be forced to thumbnail unexpected file formats, invoking potentially untrustworthy decoders

High

[sandhose](/sandhose)
published
GHSA-vp6v-whfm-rv3g
Dec 3, 2024

## Package

pip

matrix-synapse
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 1.120.1

## Patched versions

1.120.1

## Description

### Impact

In Synapse versions before 1.120.1, enabling the `dynamic_thumbnails` option or processing a specially crafted request could trigger the decoding and thumbnail generation of uncommon image formats, potentially invoking external tools like Ghostscript for processing.

This significantly expands the attack surface in a historically vulnerable area, presenting a risk that far outweighs the benefit, particularly since these formats are rarely used on the open web or within the Matrix ecosystem.

For a list of image formats, as well as decoding libraries and helper programs used, see [the Pillow documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html).

### Patches

Synapse 1.120.1 addresses the issue by restricting thumbnail generation to images in the following widely used formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP.

### Workarounds

* Ensure any image codecs and helper programs, such as Ghostscript, are patched against security vulnerabilities.
* Uninstall unused image decoder libraries and helper programs, such as Ghostscript, from the system environment that Synapse is running in.
  + Depending on the installation method, there may be some decoder libraries bundled with Pillow and these cannot be easily uninstalled.
  + The official Docker container image does not include Ghostscript.

### References

* [The Pillow documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html) includes a list of supported image formats and which libraries or helper programs are used to decode them.
