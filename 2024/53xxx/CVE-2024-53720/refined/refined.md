- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP-ISPConfig 3 plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary depending on the actions available within the plugin and the user's privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** A successful CSRF attack can be launched if a logged-in user with higher privileges visits a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a website containing malicious code that exploits the CSRF vulnerability. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
