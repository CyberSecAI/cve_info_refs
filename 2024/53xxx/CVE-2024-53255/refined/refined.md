**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of the `file` parameter in the `/admin?page=media` endpoint before it's reflected back in the HTML response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper input sanitization/encoding

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that could:
    - Steal the user's session cookie.
    - Perform phishing attacks.
    - Deface the website.

**Attack vectors:**

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious payload
- The attacker needs to induce a logged-in administrator to load the crafted URL.
