# Potential Abuse for Sending Arbitrary Emails

High

[Spencer14420](/Spencer14420)
published
GHSA-mj5r-x73q-fjw6
Nov 27, 2024

## Package

composer

spencer14420/sp-php-email-handler
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 1.0.0

## Patched versions

1.0.0

## Description

### Impact

Messages sent using this script are vulnerable to abuse, as the script allows anybody to specify arbitrary email recipients and include user-provided content in confirmation emails. This could enable malicious actors to use your server to send spam, phishing emails, or other malicious content, potentially damaging your domain's reputation and leading to blacklisting by email providers.

### Patches

Patched in version 1.0.0 by removing user-provided content from confirmation emails. All pre-release versions (alpha and beta) are vulnerable to this issue and should not be used.

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds for this issue. Users must upgrade to version 1.0.0 to mitigate the vulnerability.

### Severity

High

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-53860
