Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SSA-128393: Firmware Decryption Vulnerability in SICAM A8000 CP-8031 and CP-8050

| Publication Date: | 2024-12-10 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-12-10 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 4.6 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 5.1 |

SUMMARY

The SICAM A8000 CP-8031 and CP-8050 devices are affected by a vulnerability that could allow an attacker with physical access to the device to decrypt the firmware.

Siemens has released new firmware and hardware versions for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.
Both the firmware and the hardware update are required to fix the vulnerability. For details see the section "Additional Information".

WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid's reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the grid design.
Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff of the update process in the target environment.
As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate mechanisms (e.g. firewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to configure the environment according to our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SICAM A8000 RTUs (Remote Terminal Units) are modular devices for telecontrol and automation applications in all areas of energy supply.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2024-53832

The affected devices contain a secure element which is connected via an unencrypted SPI bus. This could allow an attacker with physical access to the SPI bus to observe the password used for the secure element authentication, and then use the secure element as an oracle to decrypt all encrypted update files.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Siemens thanks the following party for its efforts:

* Steffen Robertz, Gerhard Hechenberger, Stefan ViehbÃ¶ck, and Constantin Schieber-KnÃ¶bl from SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab for reporting the vulnerability

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The firmware update is effective only when the hardware version for the below MLFB variants is âJJâ or later version (i.e. âKKâ, âLLâ, â¦). Both firmware update and replacement of
hardware is required to fix the vulnerability.

* CP-8031(6MF28031AA00)
* CP-8031 with conformal coating (6MF28031AC00)
* CP-8050 (6MF28050AA00)
* CP-8050 with conformal coating (6MF28050AC00)
