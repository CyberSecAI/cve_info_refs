  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor can craft a request that will be triggered when a logged-in user with higher privileges interacts with it.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into interacting with a malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
