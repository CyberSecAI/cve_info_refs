  "CVE-2024-53155": {
    "Description": "The Linux kernel's ocfs2 filesystem has an uninitialized value vulnerability. When a 'struct kiocb' is passed from the block layer with its 'private' field uninitialized, it can lead to an uninitialized value read in 'ocfs2_file_read_iter'. This occurs because the 'private' field of the kiocb is used to store lock level information related to direct I/O.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'private' field of the 'struct kiocb' can be uninitialized when passed from the block layer, and this uninitialized value is then used in 'ocfs2_file_read_iter'.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uninitialized value read.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "KMSAN (Kernel Memory Sanitizer) reports an uninitialized value read, potentially leading to undefined behavior or a crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Direct I/O operations on the ocfs2 filesystem, especially using io_uring.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger direct I/O reads on the ocfs2 filesystem. This could involve a local user with appropriate privileges to mount the filesystem and perform I/O operations, or potentially a remote attacker if the filesystem is exposed through a network service."
