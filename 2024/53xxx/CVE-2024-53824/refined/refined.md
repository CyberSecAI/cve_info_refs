- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The All Bootstrap Blocks WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin allows inclusion of local files, which can lead to displaying the output of the included file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can include local files of the target website. This may allow them to access sensitive information, such as database credentials, potentially leading to a complete database takeover depending on the server configuration.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the plugin's functionality that handles file inclusion.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires Contributor-level privileges in WordPress.
