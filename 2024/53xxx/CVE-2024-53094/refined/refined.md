The provided content relates to a fix for a potential issue in the Linux kernel's RDMA/siw driver, specifically when using ISER over SIW. It does not describe a vulnerability but rather a bug fix.

**Root cause of the issue:**
- When using ISER over SIW, the initiator machine could encounter a warning from `skb_splice_from_iter()`, indicating a slab page was being used in `send_page`. This was due to the driver not properly checking if a page was suitable for `sendpage` operations before using `MSG_SPLICE_PAGES` flag.

**Weakness:**
- The driver was not checking the return value of `sendpage_ok()` before using `MSG_SPLICE_PAGES` in `siw_tcp_sendpages()`.

**Impact:**
- While not a direct vulnerability, the improper use of slab pages could lead to unpredictable behavior or potentially cause issues with data integrity or system stability, triggering warnings.

**Attack vectors:**
- N/A, This is not a vulnerability. It is related to a warning message that appears when ISER is run over SIW.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- N/A, This is not a vulnerability.
