# Arbitrary file download in Zoo-Project Echo Example

Critical

[gfenoy](/gfenoy)
published
GHSA-93rv-45r8-h5j4
Dec 4, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

up to 641cb18fec58de43a3468f314e5f8808c560e6d9

## Patched versions

None

## Description

A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in Zoo-Project Echo example. The Echo example available by default in Zoo installs implements file caching, which can be controlled by user-given parameters. No input validation is performed in this parameter, which allows an attacker to fully control the file which is returned in the response.

### Patches

Patch was [committed](https://github.com/ZOO-Project/ZOO-Project/commit/641cb18fec58de43a3468f314e5f8808c560e6d9) in November 22nd, 2024. We recommend to update up to that version.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround in this vulnerability. Patching is recommended.

### References

* Found by [XBOW](https://www.xbow.com)

### Severity

Critical

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-53982

### Weaknesses
