  "CVE-2024-53376": {
    "Description": "CyberPanel versions < 2.3.8 are vulnerable to an OS command injection. To exploit the vulnerability the attacker is required to firstly login to the webpanel.\n\nAn attacker can use a HTTP OPTIONS request to instruct the webserver running the CyberPanel application to execute arbitrary commands. This vulnerability lies in the /websites/submitWebsiteCreation endpoint.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper input sanitization in the `submitWebsiteCreation` function, specifically the `phpSelection` parameter which is directly passed to a system command execution function. This bypasses the POST request sanitization filter through use of an OPTIONS request.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "OS Command Injection",
      "Improper Input Validation",
	  "Insufficient HTTP method filtering"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges on the server, potentially leading to a complete system compromise, data exfiltration, and unauthorized access.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "HTTP OPTIONS request to the `/websites/submitWebsiteCreation` endpoint"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker must have valid login credentials to the CyberPanel web interface to exploit this vulnerability. No special positioning needed after obtaining credentials."
