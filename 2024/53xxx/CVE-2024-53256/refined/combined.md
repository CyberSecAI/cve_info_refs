# Command injection via RzBinInfo bclass due legacy code

High

[XVilka](/XVilka)
published
GHSA-5jhc-frm4-p8v9
Dec 21, 2024

## Package

rizin

## Affected versions

< 0.7.3

## Patched versions

0.7.4

## Description

### Impact

`rizin.c` still had an old snippet of code which suffered a command injection due the usage of `rz_core_cmdf` to invoke the command `m` which was removed in v0.1.x.

A malicious binary defining `bclass` (part of RzBinInfo), can execute a command, if the same binary sets `rclass` (part of RzBinInfo) to `fs`; the vulnerability can be exploited by any bin format where `bclass` and `rclass` are user defined.

### Patches

Fixed in via [db6c5b3](https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/commit/db6c5b39c065ce719f587c9815c47fbb834b10fa)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
