The provided content discusses a SQL injection vulnerability in `EventAttendance.php` within the ChurchCRM project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `Event` parameter from the URL is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `Event` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities depending on the database privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through manipulating the URL parameter `Event` in the `EventAttendance.php` script. Specifically, the URL `https://sitecom/ChurchCRM/EventAttendance.php?Action=List&Event=1%20or%20sleep(10)` demonstrates the injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the server hosting the ChurchCRM application. They also need to identify the vulnerable URL and understand how to craft SQL injection payloads.
