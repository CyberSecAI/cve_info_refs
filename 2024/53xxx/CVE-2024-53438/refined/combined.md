### **[p4b3l1t0](/p4b3l1t0)** commented [May 3, 2024](#issue-2278345706)

| **Description**  A clear and concise description of the reported bug:   * ChurchCRM version: 5.7.0   **Steps To Reproduce**   1. Go to '<https://sitecom/ChurchCRM/EventAttendance.php?Action=List&Event=1%20or%20sleep(10)>' 2. See error   **Expected behavior**  A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.  **Finding**  Title: SQL Injection Vulnerability in EventAttendance.php  Description: The EventAttendance.php script in ChurchCRM version [insert version if available] is vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the 'Event' parameter in the URL. This parameter is directly interpolated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or validation, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.  Vulnerable URL: <https://sitecom/ChurchCRM/EventAttendance.php?Action=List&Event=1%20or%20sleep(10)>  Vulnerable Code: [Link to vulnerable code](https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/blob/b99738a30444068d2cce31fe709d7a93ac524e64/src/EventAttendance.php#L27)  Mitigation: To mitigate this vulnerability, implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to handle user input securely. This ensures that user-supplied data is properly sanitized and treated as data rather than executable code.  Code snippet:  ``` $sSQL = 'SELECT * FROM events_event WHERE event_type = ? ORDER BY event_start'; $stmt = $mysqli->prepare($sSQL); $stmt->bind_param("i", $_GET['Event']); // "i" indicates the parameter is an integer $stmt->execute(); $rsOpps = $stmt->get_result(); ``` |

| [@DAcodedBEAT](https://github.com/DAcodedBEAT) I don't think so, you mitigated the vulnerability sanitizing the user supplied inputs.  I just want to get a CVE for this vuln report in <https://cveform.mitre.org/>  I don't know if you have experience with that.  Thanks, Pablo |
