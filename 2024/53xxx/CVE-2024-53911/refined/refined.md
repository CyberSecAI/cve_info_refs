{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the deserialization of untrusted data within the .NET Remoting service used by Veritas Enterprise Vault. Specifically, the application starts services that listen on random TCP ports for commands from client applications. These TCP ports are vulnerable due to issues inherent to .NET Remoting.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Deserialization of untrusted data leads to remote code execution. The .NET Remoting service is vulnerable on TCP ports and local IPC services.",
   "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable Enterprise Vault, Discovery Accelerator, and Compliance Accelerator/Veritas Surveillance Servers.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves sending specially crafted data to a vulnerable Enterprise Vault server via its .NET Remoting TCP ports and potentially local IPC services.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires the following:\n\n*   RDP access to one of the VMs in the network, implying membership in the Remote Desktop Users group.\n*   Knowledge of the EV server's IP address, process IDs (random), TCP dynamic ports (random), and remoteable object URIs.\n*   The EV server's firewall must be improperly configured."
