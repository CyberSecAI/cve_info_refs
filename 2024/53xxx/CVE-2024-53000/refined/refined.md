Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2024-53000
*   **Vulnerability Category:** Out-of-bounds Write ([CWE-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html))
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity:** Critical
*   **CVSS Base Score:** 7.8
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Explanation:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write, which occurs when the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.
*   **Weakness:** The software lacks proper bounds checking when writing data, allowing it to overwrite memory locations outside of the intended buffer.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to run malicious code on the affected system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **AV:L (Local):** The attack requires local access to the vulnerable machine.
    *   **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low.
    *   **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required for the attack
    *   **UI:R (User Interaction Required):** The attack requires user interaction, such as opening a specially crafted file.
    *   **S:U (Unchanged):** The vulnerability does not affect other components/systems.
    *   **C:H (High):** There is a high impact on confidentiality, meaning the attacker can access sensitive information
    *   **I:H (High):** There is a high impact on integrity, meaning the attacker can modify the data.
    *   **A:H (High):** There is a high impact on availability, meaning the attacker can render the system/application unavailable

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is present in Adobe Substance 3D Modeler versions 1.14.1 and earlier.
* The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.15.0.
