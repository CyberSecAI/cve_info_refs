{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Xen hypervisor uses a hypercall page containing functions executed by the guest. This page lacks an interface to specify how these functions should be modified for mitigations or hardening. Consequently, guest OS speculative execution mitigations using compiler transforms on `ret` instructions (like Linux kernel rethunk or safe-ret) can fail or malfunction. Additionally, the hypercall page lacks Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) scheme support, causing malfunction in such configurations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of interface for modifying hypercall page functions",
      "Incompatibility with speculative execution mitigations using ret instruction patching",
      "Lack of Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) scheme support"
    ],
    "impact": "Guest OS mitigations for hardware vulnerabilities might be ineffective, potentially allowing user processes to access unauthorized data. This can lead to information disclosure.",
     "attack_vectors": "Exploitation occurs if the guest OS uses speculative mitigations that modify `ret` instructions or relies on CFI schemes while using the Xen hypercall page.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have a user-level process in a vulnerable guest OS that can trigger speculative execution paths and cause the exploitation of the above weaknesses. The guest OS needs to use speculative mitigation that uses ret instruction patching, or use CFI schemes while using the Xen hypercall page."
