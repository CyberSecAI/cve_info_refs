- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The provided information does not specify the exact attack vector beyond the general classification of local attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a user interaction to trigger the vulnerability and must have local access. The CVSS vector indicates "PR:N" which means no privileges are required, and "UI:R" which means User interaction is required.
