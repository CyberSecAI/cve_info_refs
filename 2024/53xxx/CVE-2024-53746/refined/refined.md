- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Elementor Button Plus plugin for WordPress, versions 1.3.4 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to an injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can inject arbitrary scripts, including redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts will be executed when users visit the compromised pages.
- **Attack vectors:** A contributor level user can inject malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have Contributor-level privileges on the WordPress website.
