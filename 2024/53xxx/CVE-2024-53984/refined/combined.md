```
When all of the following conditions apply:

* Compile time option PB_ENABLE_MALLOC is enabled.
* Message contains at least one field with FT_POINTER field type.
* Custom stream callback is used with unknown stream length (stream.bytes_left = SIZE_MAX)
* pb_decode_ex() function is used with flag PB_DECODE_DELIMITED.
* The input message is corrupted (accidentally or maliciously) in the length prefix.

Then the pb_decode_ex() function does not automatically call pb_release(), like is done for other failure cases.
This could lead to memory leak and potential denial-of-service.

# Memory is not automatically released on error return when using PB\_DECODE\_DELIMITED

Moderate

[PetteriAimonen](/PetteriAimonen)
published
GHSA-xwqq-qxmw-hj5r
Dec 1, 2024

## Package

nanopb

## Affected versions

>=0.4.0, <=0.4.9

## Patched versions

0.4.9.1

## Description

### Impact

When **all** of the following conditions apply:

* Affects nanopb versions 0.4.0 to 0.4.9.
* Compile time option `PB_ENABLE_MALLOC` is enabled.
* Message contains at least one field with `FT_POINTER` field type.
* Custom stream callback is used with unknown stream length (`stream.bytes_left = SIZE_MAX`)
* `pb_decode_ex()` function is used with flag `PB_DECODE_DELIMITED`.
* The input message is corrupted (accidentally or maliciously) in the length prefix.

Then the `pb_decode_ex()` function does not automatically call `pb_release()`, like is done for other failure cases.

This could lead to memory leak and potential denial-of-service.

### Patches

Patch will be released as version 0.4.9.1.

### Workarounds

As a workaround, `pb_release()` can be called manually after decoding failure. Calling the release function multiple times is harmless.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
