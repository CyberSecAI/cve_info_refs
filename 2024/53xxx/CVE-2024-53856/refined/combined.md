# Panics on Malformed Untrusted Input

High

[dignifiedquire](/dignifiedquire)
published
GHSA-9rmp-2568-59rv
Dec 5, 2024

## Package

cargo

pgp
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.14.1

## Patched versions

0.14.1

## Description

During a security audit, [Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) discovered several reachable edge cases which allow an attacker to trigger `rpgp` crashes by providing crafted data.

### Impact

When processing malformed input, `rpgp` can run into Rust panics which halt the program.

This can happen in the following scenarios:

* Parsing OpenPGP messages from binary or armor format
* Decrypting OpenPGP messages via `decrypt_with_password()`
* Parsing or converting public keys
* Parsing signed cleartext messages from armor format
* Using malformed private keys to sign or encrypt

Given the affected components, we consider most attack vectors to be reachable by remote attackers during typical use cases of the `rpgp` library. The attack complexity is low since the malformed messages are generic, short, and require no victim-specific knowledge.

The result is a denial-of-service impact via program termination. There is no impact to confidentiality or integrity security properties.

### Versions and Patches

All recent versions are affected by at least some of the above mentioned issues.

The vulnerabilities have been fixed with version `0.14.1`. We recommend all users to upgrade to this version.

### References

The security audit was made possible by the [NLnet Foundation NGI Zero Core](https://nlnet.nl/core/) grant program [for rpgp](https://nlnet.nl/project/rPGP-cryptorefresh/).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
