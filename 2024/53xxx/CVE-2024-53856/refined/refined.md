- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `rpgp` library contains multiple reachable edge cases that cause Rust panics when processing malformed input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The library is vulnerable to panics when processing crafted data in several scenarios, including parsing OpenPGP messages, decrypting messages, parsing public keys, parsing signed cleartext messages, and using malformed private keys. The identified CWEs are CWE-130 (Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency), CWE-248 (Uncaught Exception), and CWE-617 (Reachable Assertion).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploiting these vulnerabilities leads to a denial-of-service by causing the program to terminate due to uncaught panics. There is no impact to confidentiality or integrity security properties.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vectors are network-based, meaning that an attacker can trigger the crashes remotely, during typical use cases of the `rpgp` library. This includes parsing OpenPGP messages from various formats or using keys in different ways.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker requires the ability to provide crafted, malformed input to the `rpgp` library. The attacker does not need any specific victim knowledge. The attack complexity is low because the malformed messages are generic and short.
