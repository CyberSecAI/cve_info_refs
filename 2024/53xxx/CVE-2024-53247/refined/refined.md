- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unsafe deserialization of data due to an insecure usage of the jsonpickle Python library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE) through deserialization of untrusted data. Specifically, insecure use of the `jsonpickle` Python library.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A low-privileged user can perform Remote Code Execution (RCE). This can lead to complete compromise of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based exploitation; attacker sends malicious serialized data to the vulnerable Splunk Secure Gateway app.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low-privileged user that does not hold the “admin“ or “power“ Splunk roles is required. The attacker needs to be able to send data to the vulnerable endpoint that uses jsonpickle.
