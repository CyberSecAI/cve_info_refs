Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from allowing the `noscript` tag in the allowed tags list of the Rails HTML sanitizer when using HTML5 sanitization. The `noscript` tag can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code, which bypasses the intended sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By including a `noscript` tag with malicious JavaScript within the content that is sanitized, an attacker can execute this code in a user's browser.
*   **Improper Neutralization of Input:** The sanitizer fails to properly neutralize or remove the malicious code within the `noscript` tag when it is included in the allowed tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Cookie theft
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Data exfiltration

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The attacker injects malicious HTML containing the `noscript` tag and malicious JavaScript into content that is passed to the vulnerable HTML sanitizer.
*   **Configuration Override:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application developer overrides the default sanitizer settings to explicitly allow the `noscript` tag.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to inject content into a field that is then sanitized using a vulnerable configuration of `rails-html-sanitizer`.
*   The attacker needs to know the specific configuration of the target application which is using HTML5 sanitization and has allowed the `noscript` tag.
*   No special network access is required, a user able to submit data is all that is needed.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**

*   **Affected versions:** `rails-html-sanitizer` version 1.6.0.
*   **Fixed versions:** Version 1.6.1 includes a fix for this issue. The fix ensures that `noscript` tags are always scrubbed, even if explicitly included in the allowed tags list.
*   **Workarounds:** Either remove `noscript` from the allowed tags, or downgrade sanitization to HTML4.
*   **Vulnerable configurations:** The vulnerability only affects applications that:
    *   Use HTML5 sanitization.
    *   Override the default allowed tags to explicitly include `noscript`.
    *   Use Rails version >= 7.1.0.

*   **Commit Details:** The commit `16251735e36ebdc302e2f90f2a39cad56879414f` in the `rails-html-sanitizer` repository removes `noscript` from the safelist, adding a warning, and adds tests to prevent this vulnerability.
