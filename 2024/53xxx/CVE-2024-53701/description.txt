Multiple FCNT Android devices provide the original security features such as "privacy mode" where arbitrary applications can be set not to be displayed, etc.
Under certain conditions, and when an attacker can directly operate the device which its screen is unlocked by a user, the provided security features' setting pages may be exposed and/or the settings may be altered, without authentication. For example, specific applications in the device configured to be hidden may be displayed and/or activated.
