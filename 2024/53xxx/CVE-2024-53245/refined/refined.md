- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A username colliding with a role name that has read access to a dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure vulnerability. Low-privileged user can see the dashboard name and the dashboard XML by cloning the dashboard due to the username collision with a role name that has read access to the dashboard.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Low-privileged user can gain access to dashboard names and their XML configurations, which could reveal sensitive information, such as queries, data sources, or visualization techniques used in the dashboard.
- **Attack vectors**: Network. An attacker can perform the attack remotely if they have access to the affected Splunk instance with Splunk Web enabled and a valid low-privilege user account that matches a role name.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a low-privileged user account within the affected Splunk instance and the account username should match a role name that has read access to the dashboard. The user should not have admin or power roles.
