Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `loading` endpoint accepting and utilizing an unvalidated `next` parameter for redirects.
* **Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation on the `next` parameter, which leads to an Open Redirect vulnerability (CWE-601).
* **Impact:** Attackers can redirect authenticated users to arbitrary external URLs. This can be exploited for phishing attacks, where users are redirected from the legitimate application to malicious sites.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the `loading` endpoint by providing a crafted URL that contains the malicious URL in the `next` parameter.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to construct and deliver a crafted URL with the malicious redirect to an authenticated user.

The content also provides a proof of concept (PoC): `Visit: /loading?next=https://google.com while authenticated. The page will redirect to google.com.`
