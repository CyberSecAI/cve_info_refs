- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control in Splunk Secure Gateway App Key Value Store (KVstore) collections endpoints.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure due to low-privileged users accessing alert search query responses they should not have access to.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Low-privileged users can view sensitive alert search query responses, potentially leading to the disclosure of confidential information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack through Splunk Secure Gateway App KVstore collection endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a low-privileged user within the Splunk environment but does not require "admin" or "power" roles.
