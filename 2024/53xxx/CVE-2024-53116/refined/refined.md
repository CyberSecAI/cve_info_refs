The provided content relates to a bug fix in the Linux kernel's Panthor DRM driver, specifically addressing an issue with partial GPU mapping of buffer objects. This issue is not a security vulnerability but rather a functional bug that could lead to kernel warnings and errors.

**Root Cause:**
The Panthor driver did not correctly handle partial mappings of buffer objects to the GPU when the mapping spanned multiple scatterlists and the mapping offset did not point to the first page of the starting scatterlist. The `offset` variable was not being reset after reaching the starting scatterlist.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect handling of memory mapping resulting in kernel warnings and errors

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Kernel warnings and errors, which do not seem to be exploitable to cause privilege escalation or code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering partial mappings with specific offsets that span multiple scatterlists through the Panthor DRM driver ioctl calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to interact with the Panthor DRM driver. This likely requires a userland program that can issue relevant ioctl calls.
