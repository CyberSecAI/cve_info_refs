- **Root cause of vulnerability:**
  - Insufficient upper limits on the total reserved amount of memory when parsing long sequences of partial OpenPGP packets.
  - Excessive memory allocation for fixed-size OpenPGP packets with large length fields, even if less data is received.
  - Lack of restrictions on Argon2 parameters within the `Symmetric Key Encrypted Session Key` (SKESK) packet processing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Resource exhaustion due to excessive memory allocation.
  - Denial of service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion.
  - Potential system instability due to memory exhaustion.
  - Long processing times due to excessive Argon2 computations.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Out-of-memory conditions leading to program crashes.
  - System instability due to memory resource exhaustion.
  - Program unresponsiveness due to long computations.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Network-based attack where an attacker sends crafted OpenPGP messages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to send crafted OpenPGP messages to a victim.
  - The attacker does not need knowledge of the symmetric secret used by the victim for the Argon2-based attack.
