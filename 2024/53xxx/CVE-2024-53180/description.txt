In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: pcm: Add sanity NULL check for the default mmap fault handler

A driver might allow the mmap access before initializing its
runtime->dma_area properly.  Add a proper NULL check before passing to
virt_to_page() for avoiding a panic.
