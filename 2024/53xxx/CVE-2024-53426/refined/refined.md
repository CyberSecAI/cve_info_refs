Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `Flow::dissectMDNS` function within the `ntopng` software. The overflow occurs when processing a crafted mDNS packet.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Heap-buffer-overflow: The `strncpy` function within the `Flow::dissectMDNS` function writes beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a crash of the `ntopng` application. This can disrupt the service provided by `ntopng` making it unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**

- Crafted network packets: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted mDNS packet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic that is processed by `ntopng` . The attacker needs to be able to craft a malformed mDNS packet that triggers the overflow.
