### **[TaiPhung217](/TaiPhung217)** commented [Nov 6, 2024](#issue-2637681572)

| Is there an existing issue for this?  * I have searched the existing issues  Can the issue be reproduced with the default theme (daylight/midnight)?  * I was able to reproduce the issue with the default theme  Could the issue be due to extensions?  * I've ruled out the possibility that the extension is causing the problem.  Describe the problem A SQL injection vulnerability has been identified in `version 3.1.11`  of the Siyuan Note application in the `ids` array parameter in the `POST endpoint /api/attr/batchGetBlockAttrs` The code that caused the vulnerability: Vulnerability occurs due to chain concatenation in sql query in file: `/siyuan-3.1.11/kernel/treenode/blocktree.go`  ``` func GetBlockTrees(ids []string) (ret map[string]*BlockTree) { 	ret = map[string]*BlockTree{} 	if 1 > len(ids) { 		return 	}  	sqlStmt := "SELECT * FROM blocktrees WHERE id IN ('" + strings.Join(ids, "','") + "')" 	rows, err := db.Query(sqlStmt) 	if err != nil { 		logging.LogErrorf("sql query [%s] failed: %s", sqlStmt, err) 		return 	} 	defer rows.Close() 	for rows.Next() { 		var block BlockTree 		if err = rows.Scan(&block.ID, &block.RootID, &block.ParentID, &block.BoxID, &block.Path, &block.HPath, &block.Updated, &block.Type); err != nil { 			logging.LogErrorf("query scan field failed: %s", err) 			return 		} 		ret[block.ID] = &block 	} 	return }  ```  In the GetBlockTrees function, it takes a single argument which is an array of string ids. this value is taken from the user input and passed directly into the sql query at:  ``` sqlStmt := "SELECT * FROM blocktrees WHERE id IN ('" + strings.Join(ids, "','") + "')" rows, err := db.Query(sqlStmt)  ``` POC Steps to Reproduce:   1. Set up the Siyuan Note application version 3.1.11 in a local environment.    2.Use sqlmap tools to dump database at api `/api/attr/batchGetBlockAttrs`    download sqlmap: `sudo apt install sqlmap`  ``` POST /api/attr/batchGetBlockAttrs HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:6806 Content-Length: 63 sec-ch-ua: "Not/A)Brand";v="8", "Chromium";v="126" sec-ch-ua-platform: "Windows" Accept-Language: en-US sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.6478.127 Safari/537.36 Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8 Accept: */* Origin: http://localhost:6806 Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty Referer: http://localhost:6806/stage/build/desktop/?r=vshr05s Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Cookie: siyuan=MTczMDg2MTkxNnxEWDhFQVFMX2dBQUJFQUVRQUFCeF80QUFBUVp6ZEhKcGJtY01CZ0FFWkdGMFlRWnpkSEpwYm1jTVZRQlRleUpYYjNKcmMzQmhZMlZ6SWpwN0lpOXphWGwxWVc0dmQyOXlhM053WVdObEx5STZleUpCWTJObGMzTkJkWFJvUTI5a1pTSTZJakV5TXpRaUxDSkRZWEIwWTJoaElqb2lZbWcxY21KMmVTSjlmWDA9fF5xFoKuR_nqED8t-xyAdLUhXwMIaj9E3nswwd1J_2-M; _ga=GA1.1.1190341866.1730861926; _ga_L7WEXVQCR9=GS1.1.1730861926.1.1.1730865252.0.0.0 Connection: keep-alive  {     "ids": [         "20200924101200-gss5vee","*"     ] }  ```  3.
