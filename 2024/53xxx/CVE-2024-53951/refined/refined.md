- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in Adobe InDesign.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a memory leak.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction (UI:R), and no special privileges (PR:N) are needed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file. This is a user-assisted attack with a low attack complexity.
