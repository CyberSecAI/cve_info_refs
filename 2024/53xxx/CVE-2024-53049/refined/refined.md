The provided content relates to a bug fix in the Linux kernel, specifically addressing a warning that arises during the use of `__kmalloc_cache_noprof` within the `slub_kunit` test module. While this commit fixes a warning related to memory allocation tagging, it does not describe a security vulnerability.

Specifically, the commit addresses a situation where `__kmalloc_cache_noprof` was directly used, which resulted in no `alloc_tag` being allocated. This caused `current->alloc_tag` to be null, leading to a warning in `alloc_tag_add_check`. The fix adds an `alloc_hook` layer to `__kmalloc_cache_noprof` within `lib/slub_kunit.c` to correctly allocate an `alloc_tag`. The fix is applied to function `test_kmalloc_redzone_access`.

This issue does not allow for remote code execution, privilege escalation, or data exposure and thus does not represent a security vulnerability.

Therefore:
**NOINFO**
