This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

chore: use sequence for typing rather than list ([#970](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/pull/970))

```
* chore: use sequence for typing rather than list

there's no reason we need to use `List` for the typing of issuers & other parameters - the `Sequence` type allows us to accept more types such as `tuple` and `set` which still support the behavior we need

* chore: use sequence rather than list for parameters in jws

loosens up the typing on `api_jws` so we accept sequences rather than just lists

* chore: undo return type change

* chore: update changelog
```

## Package

pip

PyJWT
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

=2.10.0

## Patched versions

2.10.1

## Description

### Summary

The wrong string if check is run for `iss` checking, resulting in `"acb"` being accepted for `"_abc_"`.

### Details

This is a bug introduced in version [2.10.0](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/commit/1570e708672aa9036bc772476beae8bfa48f4131#diff-6893ad4a1c5a36b8af3028db8c8bc3b62418149843fc382faf901eaab008e380R366): checking the "iss" claim

changed from `isinstance(issuer, list)` to `isinstance(issuer, Sequence)`.

```
-        if isinstance(issuer, list):
+        if isinstance(issuer, Sequence):
            if payload["iss"] not in issuer:
                raise InvalidIssuerError("Invalid issuer")
        else:
```

Since str is a Sequnce, but not a list, `in` is also used for string

comparison. This results in `if "abc" not in "__abcd__":` being

checked instead of `if "abc" != "__abc__":`.

### PoC

Check out the unit tests added here: <https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt-ghsa-75c5-xw7c-p5pm>

```
        issuer = "urn:expected"

        payload = {"iss": "urn:"}

        token = jwt.encode(payload, "secret")

        # decode() succeeds, even though `"urn:" != "urn:expected". No exception is raised.
        with pytest.raises(InvalidIssuerError):
            jwt.decode(token, "secret", issuer=issuer, algorithms=["HS256"])
```
### Impact

I would say the real world impact is not that high, seeing as the signature still has to match. We should still fix it.

### Severity

Low

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N

```
This is a bug introduced in version 2.10.0: checking the "iss" claim
changed from `isinstance(issuer, list)` to `isinstance(issuer,
Sequence)`.

```diff
-        if isinstance(issuer, list):
+        if isinstance(issuer, Sequence):
            if payload["iss"] not in issuer:
                raise InvalidIssuerError("Invalid issuer")
        else:
```

Since str is a Sequnce, but not a list, `in` is also used for string
comparison. This results in `if "abc" not in "__abcd__":` being
checked instead of `if "abc" != "__abc__":`.
