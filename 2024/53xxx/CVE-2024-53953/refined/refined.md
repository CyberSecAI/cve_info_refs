- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use After Free
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free (CWE-416) vulnerability in Adobe Animate
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by a user opening a specially crafted file, requiring user interaction (UI:R). The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs local access to the system. The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to prepare a malicious file that can trigger the use-after-free vulnerability. They also need to have the victim open the malicious file on a vulnerable version of Adobe Animate.
