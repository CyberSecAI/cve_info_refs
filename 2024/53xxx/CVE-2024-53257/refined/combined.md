# HTML injection in /debug/querylogz & /debug/env

Moderate

[rohit-nayak-ps](/rohit-nayak-ps)
published
GHSA-7mwh-q3xm-qh6p
Dec 3, 2024

## Package

gomod

vitess.io/vitess
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 21.0.1, <20.0.4, <19.0.8

## Patched versions

21.0.1, 20.0.4, 19.0.8

## Description

### Summary

The `/debug/querylogz` and `/debug/env` pages for `vtgate` and `vttablet` do not properly escape user input. The result is that queries executed by Vitess can write HTML into the monitoring page at will.

### Details

These pages are rendered using `text/template` instead of rendering with a proper HTML templating engine.

### PoC

Execute any query where part of it is HTML markup, for example as part of a string. To make it easier to observe you might want to make sure the query takes a few seconds to complete, giving you time to refresh the status page.

Example query that can trigger the issue:

```
UPDATE users
SET
    email = CONCAT("<img src=https://cataas.com/cat/says/oops>", users.idUser, "@xxx")
WHERE
    email NOT LIKE '%xxx%' AND email != "demo@xxx.com"
```

Result:

### Impact

Anyone looking at the Vitess status page is affected. This would normally be owners / administrators of the Vitess cluster.

Anyone that can influence what text show up in queries can trigger it. This would normally be pretty much everybody interacting with a system that uses Vitess as a backend.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

These templates were rendered using text/template which is fundamentally
broken as it would allow for trivial HTML injection.

Instead render using safehtml/template so that we have automatic
escaping.
