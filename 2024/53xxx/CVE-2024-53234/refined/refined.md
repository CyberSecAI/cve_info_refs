Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how the erofs filesystem handles NONHEAD logical clusters (lclusters) with a delta[1] value of 0.  This situation is not expected in normal operation, but can occur in crafted images or filesystems created by older versions of mkfs.  The code was previously bailing out immediately upon encountering a zero delta[1] value, which led to incorrect calculations of the decompressed data length. Additionally, compact indexes with `lclusterbits > 14` are illegal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Decompressed Length Calculation:**  When a NONHEAD lcluster had `delta[1] == 0`, the code would prematurely terminate the length calculation, resulting in an inaccurate decompressed length reported by FIEMAP.
- **Lack of proper validation for `lclusterbits`:** The code did not previously validate `lclusterbits` when using compact indexes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Incorrect file size information reported via FIEMAP. This could lead to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or other issues due to incorrect handling of file extents by user space programs, as suggested by the syzbot report of a warning in `iomap_iter_done`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Images/Filesystems:** An attacker could create a malicious erofs image or filesystem with NONHEAD lclusters that have a `delta[1]` value of 0.  This could be achieved using a modified `mkfs` utility or by directly manipulating image files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to mount or otherwise use a crafted erofs filesystem on a vulnerable system.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves treating a `delta[1]` value of 0 in a NONHEAD lcluster as if it were 1. The code now also checks if `lclusterbits > 14` for compact indexes and returns an error if so. This workaround handles filesystems produced by older tools.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by syzbot.
- The fix has been backported to various stable kernel branches.
- The provided diffstat shows that the vulnerability lies in `fs/erofs/zmap.c`.
