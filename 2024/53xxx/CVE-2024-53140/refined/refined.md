  "CVE-2024-53140": {
    "description": "The netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel supports iterative dumping of data via `start`, `dump`, and `done` operations. Closing a netlink socket during an ongoing dump operation previously relied on a workqueue to call the `done` operation. This approach was flawed because the workqueue could be scheduled after the socket was released by another process, leading to use-after-free issues. This commit addresses the vulnerability by removing the workqueue and directly calling the `done` function during socket release, which always happens in a process context.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is the incorrect use of a workqueue to defer the cleanup of a netlink socket during a dump operation. The workqueue could be scheduled after the socket was released, leading to a use-after-free.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A use-after-free vulnerability could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user-space application closes a netlink socket while a dump operation is in progress. The user must initiate a dump operation and then close the socket.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to interact with netlink sockets, typically from user space. No specific privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability."
