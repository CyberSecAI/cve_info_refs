Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the direct injection of the `notebook` parameter into the SQL query within the `searchHistory` function, without any sanitization or input validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly uses user-supplied input in the SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. Specifically, the `notebook` parameter within the `POST /api/history/searchHistory` endpoint is susceptible.
- **Lack of input sanitization/validation:** User-controlled input (the 'notebook' parameter) is not sanitized or validated before being used in an SQL query.
- **Use of string concatenation for SQL queries:** Building SQL queries using string concatenation instead of parameterized queries or prepared statements allows for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Database information disclosure:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as schema information, table names, and potentially user data, as seen in the provided example where the attacker was able to extract the sqlite schema.
- **Data manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `notebook` parameter of a `POST` request to the `/api/history/searchHistory` endpoint.
- **Web interface:** Any interface that allows user input to reach this endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** An attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Knowledge of endpoint and parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/api/history/searchHistory`) and the vulnerable parameter (`notebook`).
- **Ability to craft SQL payloads:**  The attacker must be able to construct SQL injection payloads to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No authentication required:** The provided example does not show any authentication being performed.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Siyuan Note version 3.1.11
- The vulnerability was found in the `kernel/model/history.go` file.
- The identified vulnerabilities were addressed in a set of commits linked to issue #13077 which reference this issue #13058
- There are other similar issues (CVE-2024-53504) involving other endpoints being vulnerable to SQL Injection, as referenced in the description of issue #13077

This information provides a solid description of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited, aligning with the details usually present in CVE descriptions.
