- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Lenxel Core plugin for Lenxel(LNX) LMS is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Local File Inclusion (LFI).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can include local files of the target website and display their output. This could allow access to files containing sensitive data, such as database credentials, potentially leading to a full database takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: By exploiting the LFI vulnerability, an attacker can manipulate file paths to include arbitrary files on the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user with "Contributor" privileges.
