- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ITERAS WordPress plugin <= 1.7.0 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary depending on the actions that can be triggered.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to craft a malicious request that is then triggered by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any specific privileges and can be unauthenticated, however they need to trick an authenticated user into executing a crafted request.
