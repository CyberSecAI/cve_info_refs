**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **TOCTOU Race Condition:** The vulnerability arises from a race condition where a check on a resource's state is performed at one point in time, and the actual use of that resource happens at a later time, without ensuring that the state remains consistent in between. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially security issues if an attacker can manipulate the resource in that time window.
