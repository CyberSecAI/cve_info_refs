- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write, where the software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to have local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have a user interact with a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability, as user interaction is required. No specific privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
