The provided content relates to a patch addressing a crash in the Qualcomm PCIe endpoint driver in the Linux kernel. This patch is relevant to the CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is that the endpoint cleanup functions (dw_pcie_ep_cleanup() and pci_epc_deinit_notify()) were being called during the execution of qcom_pcie_perst_assert(), which occurs when the host asserts PERST#. However, the reference clock (refclk) that the endpoint relies on is disabled by the host shortly after PERST# assertion. The cleanup functions require accessing hardware registers, and accessing these registers without refclk causes a crash in the endpoint SoC.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The cleanup functions were being called during a period when the hardware could not be accessed without causing a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact of this vulnerability is a crash of the endpoint SoC, rendering it unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the host asserting PERST#. This is not a direct attacker-controlled event but is part of the normal operation of PCIe. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of the power state changes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific attacker capabilities or positions are required, the crash happens due to improper handling of PERST# signal by the driver.
