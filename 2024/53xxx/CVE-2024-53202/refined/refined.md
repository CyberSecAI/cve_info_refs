Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a resource leak in the `fw_log_firmware_info()` function within the Linux kernel's firmware loader. The function calculates the SHA256 checksum of a firmware file. If memory allocation (`kmalloc`) for `shash` fails after allocating `alg`, the allocated `alg` is not freed, leading to a resource leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Resource leak: Failure to free the `alg` instance allocated using crypto_alloc_shash under an error condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: Repeatedly triggering the error condition in `fw_log_firmware_info()` can lead to resource exhaustion due to the memory leak, potentially causing system instability or denial of service.
- The leak is in the kernel, so it would be a kernel-level resource exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- Loading firmware that causes the `kmalloc` for `shash` to fail.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to trigger firmware loading.
- The attacker would need to cause memory allocation for `shash` to fail after `alg` has been allocated. This may require a specific, potentially low memory situation.
- No specific location/position is mentioned. This could be an attacker with control over the firmware or an attacker who has an ability to trigger loading of a firmware image.
