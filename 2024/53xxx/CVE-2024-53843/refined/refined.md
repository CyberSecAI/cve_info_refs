- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of a victim who visits the link.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious URL crafted with injected JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and lure a victim into clicking on it. The attacker can be remote as the attack vector is network based.
