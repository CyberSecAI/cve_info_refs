# Reflected XSS Vulnerability in Authentication Flow URL Handling

High

[duckboy81](/duckboy81)
published
GHSA-w5rq-g9r6-vrcg
Nov 25, 2024

## Package

npm

@dapperduckling/keycloak-connector-server
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<2.5.4

## Patched versions

2.5.5

## Description

**Impact**

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the authentication flow of the application. This issue arises due to improper sanitization of the URL parameters, allowing the URL bar's contents to be injected and reflected into the HTML page. An attacker could craft a malicious URL to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of a victim who visits the link.

**Who is impacted?**

Any application utilizing this authentication library is vulnerable. Users of the application are at risk if they can be lured into clicking on a crafted malicious link.

**Patches**

The vulnerability has been patched in **2.5.5** by ensuring proper sanitization and escaping of user input in the affected URL parameters.

Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the following versions:

**Workarounds**

If upgrading is not immediately possible, users can implement the following workarounds:

* Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests containing suspicious URL parameters.
* Apply input validation and escaping directly within the application’s middleware or reverse proxy layer, specifically targeting the affected parameters.

**References**

* OWASP Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Cheat Sheet: <https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
