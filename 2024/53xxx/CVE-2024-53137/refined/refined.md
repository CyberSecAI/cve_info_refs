Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-53137.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The cacheflush syscall on ARM was broken due to the implementation of PAN (Privileged Access Never) for LPAE (Large Physical Address Extension). User access was not enabled around the cache maintenance instructions, which caused them to fault.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of user access permissions during cache maintenance operations. Specifically, user access should be enabled before executing cache maintenance instructions and then restored afterwards.
-  The `cacheflush` system call did not correctly enable user access around the cache maintenance instructions, resulting in a fault when executed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A fault occurs during a `cacheflush` syscall. The `cacheflush` system call was not working as expected on ARM architecture after PAN implementation. This can lead to unexpected behavior, system instability, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user-space application or process attempting to use the `cacheflush` syscall would trigger the fault if the vulnerability exists.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code in user-space.
- The attacker must be able to call the `cacheflush` syscall.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in commit `7af5b901e847` ("ARM: 9358/2: Implement PAN for LPAE by TTBR0 page table walks disablement").
- The fix involves enabling user access before performing the cache operation and disabling it afterwards, using `uaccess_save_and_enable()` and `uaccess_restore()` respectively.
- The fix was introduced in commit `ca29cfcc4a21083d671522ad384532e28a43f033`.
- The fix was backported to stable kernels with commit `e6960a2ed49c9a25357817535f7cc50594a58604`.
