- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the Asset CleanUp: Page Speed Booster plugin for WordPress.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin allows a malicious actor to make website requests to arbitrary domains of their choosing, which is a classic SSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to discover sensitive information about other services running on the system or perform other malicious actions on the target's internal network.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the vulnerable plugin, which allows execution of arbitrary requests to external domains.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator level privileges in order to exploit the vulnerability.
