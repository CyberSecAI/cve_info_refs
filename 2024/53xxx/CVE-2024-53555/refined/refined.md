- Root cause of vulnerability: Malicious code injection via user input fields during issue creation.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: CSV Injection (CWE-1236). Specifically, the application doesn't sanitize user inputs, allowing for injection of malicious formulas.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary OS command execution on the administrator's endpoint upon opening the exported CSV file.
- Attack vectors: A low-privileged project member injects malicious code into issue fields. An administrator later downloads a CSV report containing this injected code.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be a low-privileged project member capable of creating issues within the Taiga system. They also require an administrator to download and open the generated CSV file on their local machine.
