Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-53365:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

   - The provided content directly references "CVE-2024-53365" and includes a description of the vulnerability, indicating that the content is indeed related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the profile name field on the `/users/profile.php` page of the PHPGURUKUL Vehicle Parking Management System v1.13. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - Stored Blind Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability is classified as "stored" because the malicious payload is saved within the application's database and "blind" because the attacker doesn't immediately see the impact of the injected script.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability enables attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to several malicious activities, including:
        - Data theft: Stealing sensitive information like user credentials or session tokens.
        - Session hijacking: Taking over a user's session, gaining unauthorized access to their account.
        - Other malicious actions: Performing actions on behalf of the victim, defacing the website, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - The attack vector is the profile name field located on the `/users/profile.php` page.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the PHPGURUKUL Vehicle Parking Management System v1.13. This means they must have a valid account and be logged into the application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a clear Proof of Concept (PoC), demonstrating how to inject an XSS payload into the vulnerable profile name field.
*   The content also includes links to the CVE record and NVD entry, which are helpful for further information.

**Summary:**

CVE-2024-53365 is a stored blind XSS vulnerability in the profile name field of the PHPGURUKUL Vehicle Parking Management System v1.13. An authenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, and other client-side attacks.
