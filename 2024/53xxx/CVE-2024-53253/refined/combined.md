# Improper error handling leaks Application Integration Client Secret

Moderate

[geoffg-sentry](/geoffg-sentry)
published
GHSA-v5h2-q2w4-gpcx
Nov 22, 2024

## Package

pip

sentry
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

24.11.0

## Patched versions

>= 24.11.1

## Description

### Impact

During routine testing, we identified a scenario where a specific error message generated by our platform could include a plaintext Client ID and Client Secret for an application integration. The Client ID and Client Secret would not be displayed in the UI, but would be returned in the underlying HTTP response to the end user. This could occur under the following conditions:

* An app installation made use of a [Search UI component](https://docs.sentry.io/organization/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/formfield/#select) with the `async` flag set to true (default: true),
* A user types types into the Search Component which creates a request to the third-party for search or query results, and
* That third-party response may then fail validation and Sentry would return the `select-requester.invalid-response` error code along with a serialized version of a Sentry application containing the integration Client Secret.

Should this error be found, it's reasonable to assume the potential exposure of an integration Client Secret. However, an ID and Secret pair alone does not provide direct access to any data. For that secret to be abused an attacker would also need to obtain a valid API token for a Sentry application.

#### Impact for SaaS Users

For Sentry SaaS users, we have confirmed that only a single application integration was impacted and the owner has rotated their Client Secret. We have also confirmed that no abuse of the leaked Client Secret has occurred.

#### Potential Impact for Self-Hosted Users

Sentry self-hosted does not ship with any application integrations. This could only impact self-hosted users that maintain their own integrations. In that case, search for a `select-requester.invalid-response` event. Please note that this error was also shared with another event unrelated to this advisory so you will also need to review the parameters logged for each named event. You may review [select\_requester.py](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/4a448fbb0d0b416fef9ee0ab26579e0dc16f21b7/src/sentry/sentry_apps/external_requests/select_requester.py#L78-L123) for the instances where these errors can be generated. With the security fix this is no longer a shared event type.

### Patches

* Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action.
* Sentry self-hosted users should upgrade to 24.11.1 or higher.

### References

* Bug introduced in [#79377](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/79377)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Ok more like let's differentiate between when we fail due to external requests failing or due to validation errors

Changes:

* Endpoint now throws a ValidationError if we fail to validate the resp or the resp is missing fields
* APIError is only thrown if the request fails
* We still only return 400s so there should be no client side changes
* Update tests to reflect the new exceptions
* Make empty arrays valid response

Sorry, something went wrong.

now that we aren't swallowing this exception, do we gracefully handle it?

Good pt, I just added a distinction to check now, if we get ApiError -> we return a message about validation failure and if the request to the webhook goes wrong we return a somewhat generic message and log the error.

the final url would come in handy in checking who we are contacting, and what the final query stirng is (since for this request we tend to have a bunch of query params).
