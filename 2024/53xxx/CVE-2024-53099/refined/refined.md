The provided content is related to CVE-2024-53099.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a missing check for the validity of `link->type` in the `bpf_link_show_fdinfo()` function within the Linux kernel's BPF subsystem. If a new link type is added without a corresponding `BPF_LINK_TYPE()` invocation to register its string representation, accessing `bpf_link_type_strs[link->type]` can lead to an out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: Accessing `bpf_link_type_strs` with an invalid `link->type` can cause a read beyond the array's boundaries.
- Missing validation: The code lacked a check to ensure that `link->type` is within the valid range of registered link types.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: An out-of-bounds read in the kernel can lead to a crash, causing a denial-of-service.
- Information leak: While not explicitly stated, an out-of-bounds read could potentially lead to the disclosure of kernel memory content.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by creating a BPF link of a type that has not been registered via `BPF_LINK_TYPE()`.
- Subsequently, triggering the `bpf_link_show_fdinfo()` function (likely through an ioctl or similar mechanism that accesses fdinfo) on the created link will cause the out of bound read.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create BPF links and trigger the `bpf_link_show_fdinfo()` function.
- This typically requires elevated privileges like `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` or similar capabilities that allow interacting with BPF subsystem, so a local user can trigger this vulnerability.
