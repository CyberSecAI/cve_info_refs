In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Check validity of link->type in bpf_link_show_fdinfo()

If a newly-added link type doesn't invoke BPF_LINK_TYPE(), accessing
bpf_link_type_strs[link->type] may result in an out-of-bounds access.

To spot such missed invocations early in the future, checking the
validity of link->type in bpf_link_show_fdinfo() and emitting a warning
when such invocations are missed.
