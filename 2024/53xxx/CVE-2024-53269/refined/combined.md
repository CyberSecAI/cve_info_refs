Moderate

[phlax](/phlax)
published
GHSA-mfqp-7mmj-rm53
Dec 18, 2024

## Package

Envoy

## Affected versions

> 1.30

## Patched versions

1.32.2, 1.31.4, 1.30.8

## Description

### Details

When additional address are not ip addresses, then the Happy Eyeballs sorting algorithm will crash in data plane. This CVE will validate all additional and original addresses are IP addresses.

### PoC

### Mitigation

* Disable Happy Eyeballs
* Change the IP configuration

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
