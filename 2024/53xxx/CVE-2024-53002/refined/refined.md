- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in Adobe Substance 3D Modeler.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L) and requires user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system and requires the user to perform some action to trigger the vulnerability (e.g., opening a crafted file). No privileges are needed (PR:N).
