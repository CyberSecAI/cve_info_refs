# Possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of rails-html-sanitizer 1.6.0

Moderate

[flavorjones](/flavorjones)
published
GHSA-w8gc-x259-rc7x
Dec 2, 2024

## Package

bundler

rails-html-sanitizer
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

1.6.0

## Patched versions

1.6.1

## Description

## Summary

There is a possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of Rails::HTML::Sanitizer 1.6.0 when used with Rails >= 7.1.0 and Nokogiri < 1.15.7, or 1.16.x < 1.16.8.

* Versions affected: 1.6.0
* Not affected: < 1.6.0
* Fixed versions: 1.6.1

Please note that the fix in v1.6.1 is to update the dependency on Nokogiri to 1.15.7 or >= 1.16.8.

## Impact

A possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of Rails::HTML::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if HTML5 sanitization is enabled and the application developer has overridden the sanitizer's allowed tags in either of the following ways:

* allow both "math" and "style" elements
* or allow both "svg" and "style" elements

Code is only impacted if Rails is configured to use HTML5 sanitization, please see documentation for [`config.action_view.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-view-sanitizer-vendor) and [`config.action_text.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-text-sanitizer-vendor) for more information on these configuration options.

Code is only impacted if allowed tags are being overridden. Applications may be doing this in a few different ways:

1. using application configuration to configure Action View sanitizers' allowed tags:

```
# In config/application.rb
config.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags = ["math", "style"]
# or
config.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags = ["svg", "style"]
```

see <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-action-view>

2. using a `:tags` option to the Action View helper `sanitize`:

```
<%= sanitize @comment.body, tags: ["math", "style"] %>
<%# or %>
<%= sanitize @comment.body, tags: ["svg", "style"] %>

```

see <https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html#method-i-sanitize>

3. setting Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer class attribute `allowed_tags`:

```
# class-level option
Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags = ["math", "style"]
# or
Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags = ["svg", "style"]
```

(note that this class may also be referenced as `Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer`)

4. using a `:tags` options to the Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer instance method `sanitize`:

```
# instance-level option
Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.new.sanitize(@article.body, tags: ["math", "style"])
# or
Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.new.sanitize(@article.body, tags: ["svg", "style"])
```

(note that this class may also be referenced as `Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer`)

5. setting ActionText::ContentHelper module attribute `allowed_tags`:

```
ActionText::ContentHelper.allowed_tags = ["math", "style"]
# or
ActionText::ContentHelper.allowed_tags = ["svg", "style"]
```

All users overriding the allowed tags by any of the above mechanisms to include (("math" or "svg") and "style") should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds.

## Workarounds

Any one of the following actions will work around this issue:

* Remove "style" from the overridden allowed tags,
* Or, remove "math" and "svg" from the overridden allowed tags,
* Or, downgrade sanitization to HTML4 (see documentation for [`config.action_view.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-view-sanitizer-vendor) and [`config.action_text.sanitizer_vendor`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-action-text-sanitizer-vendor) for more information)
* Or, independently upgrade Nokogiri to v1.15.7 or >= 1.16.8.
