- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, allowing unprivileged users to execute higher-privileged actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Unprivileged users can execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies depending on the context of the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector is not explicitly stated, but it involves exploiting a function within the Tutor LMS Elementor Addons plugin that lacks proper access controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a "Subscriber" level user, which is a low-privilege user role in WordPress.
