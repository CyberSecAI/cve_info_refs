The provided content is related to a fix for a memory leak in the Linux kernel's virtio vsock implementation when using MSG_ZEROCOPY.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A missing `kfree_skb()` call in the error handling path of `virtio_transport_send_pkt_info` function when `virtio_transport_init_zcopy_skb` fails, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak: If `virtio_transport_init_zcopy_skb` fails and returns a non-zero value, the allocated socket buffer `skb` is not freed, resulting in a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Repeated triggering of the error condition could lead to a denial-of-service due to memory exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by repeatedly sending crafted messages that would cause the `virtio_transport_init_zcopy_skb` function to fail.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to send messages over the virtio vsock interface.
