Based on the provided information, all the commits address the same vulnerability.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `vop_plane_atomic_async_check` function within the Rockchip DRM driver. Specifically, there's a potential null pointer dereference in how the `crtc_state` is obtained. The code was previously directly dereferencing 'state' without ensuring it was not NULL.

**Weakness:**
The primary weakness is a missing null check before dereferencing the `state` variable in the `vop_plane_atomic_async_check` function. This can lead to a crash if the state is NULL.

**Impact:**
If the `state` variable is NULL, the kernel will attempt to dereference a null pointer, leading to a kernel crash. This can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves triggering the `vop_plane_atomic_async_check` function with a NULL state. The exact circumstances leading to a NULL state are not fully detailed but likely involves specific DRM operations related to plane updates or cursor updates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need the ability to interact with the DRM subsystem in a way that could lead to `vop_plane_atomic_async_check` being called with a NULL state. This typically implies a user-level process with access to DRM functionalities, possibly via crafted ioctl calls or specific DRM API usage.
