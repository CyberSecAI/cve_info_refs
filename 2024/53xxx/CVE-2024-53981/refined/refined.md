```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `python-multipart` library skips line breaks (CR `\\r` or LF `\\n`) before the first boundary and any trailing bytes after the last boundary one byte at a time, emitting a log event each time. This can lead to excessive logging.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability due to the inefficient parsing of form data, specifically how the library handles data before the first and after the last boundary. The issue also causes excessive logging.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can send a crafted malicious request with large amounts of data before the first boundary or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread. In ASGI applications, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, by sending a specially crafted `multipart/form-data` request to an application that uses the vulnerable `python-multipart` library.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction. They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application."
