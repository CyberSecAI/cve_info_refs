# Denial of service (DoS) via deformation `multipart/form-data` boundary

High

[Kludex](/Kludex)
published
GHSA-59g5-xgcq-4qw3
Nov 30, 2024

## Package

pip

python-multipart
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<0.0.18

## Patched versions

0.0.18

## Description

### Summary

When parsing form data, `python-multipart` skips line breaks (CR `\r` or LF `\n`) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary. This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain inputs.

An attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).

### Impact

Applications that use `python-multipart` to parse form data (or use frameworks that do so) are affected.

### Original Report

This security issue was reported by:

* GitHub security advisory in Starlette on October 30 by [@Startr4ck](https://github.com/Startr4ck)
* Email to `python-multipart` maintainer on October 3 by [@mnqazi](https://github.com/mnqazi)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-53981
