In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/CPU/AMD: Clear virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE on Zen4 client

A number of Zen4 client SoCs advertise the ability to use virtualized
VMLOAD/VMSAVE, but using these instructions is reported to be a cause
of a random host reboot.

These instructions aren't intended to be advertised on Zen4 client
so clear the capability.
