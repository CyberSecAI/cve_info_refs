- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions while they are authenticated. The specific impact varies depending on the actions available within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by tricking a logged-in user into performing actions on the vulnerable application without their knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into performing the malicious request. No specific privileges or access to the target system is required for the attacker to trigger the vulnerability; however, user interaction is needed.
