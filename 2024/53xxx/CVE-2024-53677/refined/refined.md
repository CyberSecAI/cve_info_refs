    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application which uses the Struts framework and has file upload functionality utilizing the vulnerable file upload mechanism.",
        "details": "The vulnerability affects applications that utilize the FileUploadInterceptor. Applications not using the FileUploadInterceptor are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is similar to the one described in S2-066.  The issue stems from how Struts handles the path of uploaded files, which, if manipulated, can allow writing a malicious file in an arbitrary location.  Specifically, the path traversal is achieved through the use of relative path segments like '../'. The fix is not backward compatible since it requires a rewrite to use the new Action File Upload mechanism."
