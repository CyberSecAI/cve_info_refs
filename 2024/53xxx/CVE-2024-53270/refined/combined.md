# HTTP/1: sending overload crashes when the request is reset beforehand

High

[phlax](/phlax)
published
GHSA-q9qv-8j52-77p3
Dec 18, 2024

## Package

Envoy

## Affected versions

< 1.32.0

## Patched versions

1.32.3, 1.31.5, 1.30.9, 1.29.12

## Description

### Details

`sendOverloadError` is going to assume the active request exists when `envoy.load_shed_points.http1_server_abort_dispatch` is configured. If `active_request` is nullptr, only onMessageBeginImpl() is called. However, the `onMessageBeginImpl` will directly return ok status if the stream is already reset leading to the nullptr reference. The downstream reset can actually happen during the H/2 upstream reset,

### PoC

* Has http1 `http1_server_abort_dispatch` configured
* Has the H1 stream be reset by something else
* During dispatching this bug will trigger but we guard with resetStreamCalled

### Impact

Envoy will crash

### Mitigation

* Disable `http1_server_abort_dispatch` load shed point
* Use a high threshold.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
