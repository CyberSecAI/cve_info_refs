Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how `rails-html-sanitizer` handles specific combinations of allowed HTML tags when using HTML5 sanitization. Specifically, when "math", "mtext", "table", and "style" tags are allowed, along with either "mglyph" or "malignmark", it creates a loophole for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insufficient Sanitization:** The sanitizer fails to properly neutralize or escape potentially malicious content when the mentioned tag combinations are permitted. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.
- **Configuration-Dependent:** The vulnerability only occurs if the application developer has explicitly overridden the sanitizer's default allowed tags to include the problematic combinations. The default configuration is not vulnerable.
- **HTML5 Sanitization Specific:** This issue is specific to the HTML5 sanitization implementation, and not HTML4.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation leads to XSS, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can result in various harmful actions, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing sensitive information
    - Defacing websites
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input:** An attacker injects HTML code containing malicious scripts within the allowed tags ("math", "mtext", "table", "style", and either "mglyph" or "malignmark") that are then rendered by the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Inject HTML:** The attacker must be able to provide input to the application that can be processed by the vulnerable sanitization logic. This might involve:
    - User-generated content (e.g., comments, forum posts, etc.)
    - Data within the application's data store
    - API payloads
- **Target Application Configuration:** The attacker must target applications using rails-html-sanitizer 1.6.0 with HTML5 sanitization enabled, and which have overridden the default allowed tags as specified.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')).
- The fix was to disallow 'mglyph' and 'malignmark' tags.
- The advisory includes code examples on how to identify the vulnerable configurations
- The advisory references a HackerOne report
