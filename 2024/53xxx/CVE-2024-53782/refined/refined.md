- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Photo Video Store WordPress plugin (versions <= 21.07) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of CSRF protection mechanisms in the plugin.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site, under their current authentication. The specific impact varies case by case depending on the actions triggered.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted request that tricks an authenticated user into unknowingly performing actions on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user to visit a malicious site or execute a malicious script that triggers the crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
