- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Build App Online plugin, versions 1.0.23 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions while authenticated, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or access.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted requests that exploit the lack of CSRF protection within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into executing a malicious request.
