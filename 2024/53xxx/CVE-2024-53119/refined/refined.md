The provided content describes a memory leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's virtio vsock implementation, specifically related to the accept queue. This vulnerability is addressed by commit d7b0ff5a866724c3ad21f2628c22a63336deec3f and backported into multiple stable kernel branches.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the asynchronous nature of socket destruction. The `virtio_transport_recv_listen()` function, which handles incoming connection requests, could be called after the socket's accept queue is flushed but before the `SOCK_DONE` flag is set during socket destruction. This leads to a race condition where new connections can be enqueued to the accept queue which are never removed, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Race condition:** A race condition exists between the flushing of the accept queue during socket destruction and the setting of the `SOCK_DONE` flag.
*   **Memory Leak:** Due to the race, sockets can be enqueued to the accept queue and never removed, leading to a memory leak over time.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Memory exhaustion:** Repeated triggering of the race condition can exhaust available memory.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Memory exhaustion can lead to system instability and potentially a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious guest OS:** A malicious guest OS using virtio-vsock could trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Network activity:** By sending connection requests to a listening vsock, a malicious actor can trigger the vulnerability during socket closing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create network activity to trigger the `virtio_transport_recv_listen` function.
*   The attacker needs to be in a position to influence the timing of socket destruction related actions.
*   In the case of virtualized environments, this can be a malicious guest.

**Patch:**

The fix introduces a check for `sk->sk_shutdown == SHUTDOWN_MASK` in `virtio_transport_recv_listen()`. This check prevents further enqueueing to the accept queue after the socket has been shut down, resolving the race condition and memory leak.

The provided content includes multiple commit references, each applying the same fix to different branches of the Linux kernel. This indicates a wide impact of the vulnerability across various kernel versions.
