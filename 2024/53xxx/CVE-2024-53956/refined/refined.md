- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Adobe Premiere Pro.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring user interaction (UI:R). The vulnerability can be triggered without special privileges (PR:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious file that triggers the overflow, as user interaction is required.
