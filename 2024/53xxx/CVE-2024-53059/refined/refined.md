```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `iwl_mvm_send_recovery_cmd` function in the Intel iwlwifi driver does not validate the size of the response packet and fails to free the response buffer after use.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of response packet size validation",
      "Missing buffer deallocation"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to memory corruption or other undefined behavior due to the missing size check and memory leak due to not freeing the allocated memory.",
     "attack_vectors": "An attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability by sending crafted or unexpected responses from the firmware when the recovery command is sent, potentially leading to a denial of service or memory corruption.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would likely need the capability to interact with the WiFi firmware or manipulate its responses to exploit this vulnerability. Specific driver or hardware knowledge would likely be needed."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix involves switching from the `iwl_mvm_send_cmd` function to `iwl_mvm_send_cmd_status` function. This new function handles both response size validation and frees the buffer, resolving the identified issues."
