### @ii5mai1 **[ii5mai1](/ii5mai1)** commented [Nov 8, 2024](#issue-2644268938) • edited Loading

**Summary:**

This pull request addresses two security vulnerabilities:

* IDOR Vulnerability: An IDOR vulnerability allows attackers to upload photos on behalf of any user by modifying the user parameter to another user's ID.
* XSS Vulnerability via File Upload: Exploiting the IDOR vulnerability, an attacker can upload an HTML file as an admin. This introduces a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which could lead to admin account takeover.

Sorry, something went wrong.
