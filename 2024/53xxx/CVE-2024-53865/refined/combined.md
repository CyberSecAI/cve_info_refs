# Python package "zhmcclient" has passwords in clear text in its HMC and API logs

High

[andy-maier](/andy-maier)
published
GHSA-p57h-3cmc-xpjq
Nov 28, 2024

## Package

pip

zhmcclient
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<1.18.1

## Patched versions

1.18.1

## Description

### Impact

The Python package "zhmcclient" writes password-like properties in clear text into its HMC and API logs in the following cases:

* The 'boot-ftp-password' and 'ssc-master-pw' properties when creating or updating a partition in DPM mode, in the zhmcclient API and HMC logs
* The 'ssc-master-pw' and 'zaware-master-pw' properties when updating an LPAR in classic mode, in the zhmcclient API and HMC logs
* The 'ssc-master-pw' and 'zaware-master-pw' properties when creating or updating an image activation profile in classic mode, in the zhmcclient API and HMC logs
* The 'password' property when creating or updating an HMC user, in the zhmcclient API log
* The 'bind-password' property when creating or updating an LDAP server definition, in the zhmcclient API and HMC logs

This issue affects only users of the zhmcclient package that have enabled the Python loggers named "zhmcclient.api" (for the API log) or "zhmcclient.hmc" (for the HMC log) and that use the functions listed above.

### Patches

Has been fixed in zhmcclient version 1.18.1

### Workarounds

Not applicable, since fix is available.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CVE ID

Fixed clear-text logging of all password-like properties in API/HMC log

```
Details:

* Reworked the @logged_api_call decorator to get optional parameters
  for specifying properties ot be blanked out in the API logging.
  This required significant reimplementation of that decorator and
  the functions it calls.

* Fixed the clear-text logging of all password-like properties in the API
  logging by using this new capability of the @logged_api_call decorator.

* Fixed the clear-text logging of all password-like properties in the HMC
  logging by blanking them out in the Session.post() method.

* Added unit test cases for the blanked-out API logging, in the
  test_logging.py module.

* Added unit test cases for the blanked-out API logging, in all test
  modules for those resources that have blanked-out properties.

* Improved the checking in the unit test cases for API logging, to check
  the function name, args, kwargs and return value in the log messages.
