The provided content relates to a patch that addresses a potential double-free vulnerability in the AMD display driver within the Linux kernel. This patch is identified as commit `6825cb07b79ffeb1d90ffaa7a1227462cdca34ae` and `874ff59cde8fc525112dda26b501a1bac17dde9f` which are the same.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a failure to handle Dynamic Memory Layout (DML) allocation failures when copying display states. If a DML allocation fails, the copied display state would contain invalid pointers. This would lead to `dc_state_copy_internal` shallow copying these invalid pointers and a double free would occur when the new state was released.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Invalid memory access:** The core weakness lies in the use of potentially invalid pointers within the copied display state when DML allocation fails. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes.
-   **Double-free:**  A double-free vulnerability exists because the invalid pointers may be freed twice when the copied state is released.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a system crash due to a double-free, potentially resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is through the normal system operations involving display state creation and modification that trigger DML allocation, which could fail due to various system resource constraints. The attacker doesn't need to directly trigger the allocation failure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

An attacker would require a valid environment where the AMD display driver is used and has the ability to trigger a display state copy, leading to the possibility of a DML allocation failure. The attacker needs to have access to the system to trigger these operations.
