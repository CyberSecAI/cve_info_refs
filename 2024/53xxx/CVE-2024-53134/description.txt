In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pmdomain: imx93-blk-ctrl: correct remove path

The check condition should be 'i < bc->onecell_data.num_domains', not
'bc->onecell_data.num_domains' which will make the look never finish
and cause kernel panic.

Also disable runtime to address
"imx93-blk-ctrl 4ac10000.system-controller: Unbalanced pm_runtime_enable!"
