- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `panthor_device_mmap_io()` function in the Panthor DRM driver had two issues:
    1. It did not clear the `VM_MAYWRITE` flag when rejecting mappings with `VM_WRITE` set for `DRM_PANTHOR_USER_FLUSH_ID_MMIO_OFFSET`. This allowed userspace to later use `mprotect()` to make the mapping writable.
    2. It did not block `MAP_PRIVATE` mappings, which when combined with `VM_MAYWRITE` result in copy-on-write semantics. This is not supported for VM_PFNMAP, where page table entries (PTEs) are installed using a fault handler.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Improper write protection:** The driver failed to fully prevent write access to a specific memory region.
    - **Incorrect handling of copy-on-write mappings:** The driver did not properly handle private mappings with copy-on-write semantics when dealing with memory regions that install PTEs through a fault handler.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Potential for unexpected flushes:** Although considered unlikely in practice, making the FLUSH_ID mapping writable could potentially trigger more flushes than intended.
    - **Kernel crash:** Using a private mapping with copy-on-write semantics could lead to a kernel crash (BUG() check hit in `vmf_insert_pfn_prot()`) when a fault occurs.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - **Mprotect:** A user space process could remap the initially read-only memory region as writable using `mprotect()` after the initial `mmap()`.
    - **Private mapping with copy-on-write:** By creating a `MAP_PRIVATE` mapping with `VM_MAYWRITE`, which results in copy-on-write semantics and then access the memory region.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have access to the Panthor DRM device.
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to call `mmap()` and `mprotect()`.
    - The attacker needs the ability to trigger a page fault.
