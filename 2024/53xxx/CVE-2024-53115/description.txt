In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vmwgfx: avoid null_ptr_deref in vmw_framebuffer_surface_create_handle

The 'vmw_user_object_buffer' function may return NULL with incorrect
inputs. To avoid possible null pointer dereference, add a check whether
the 'bo' is NULL in the vmw_framebuffer_surface_create_handle.
