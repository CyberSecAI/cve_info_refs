Based on the provided information, this is a valid report for CVE-2024-53258.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `download_all_submissions` feature within Autolab. The code allows a user to download submissions of other users. Specifically, the check `if user != current_user` only verifies that the requested user is not the *current user*, but does not prevent a user from requesting another users' submissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Authorization (CWE-862):** The application does not properly authorize the `download_all_submissions` action, allowing students to access other students' submissions.
- **Privacy Violation (CWE-359):** The ability to download other students' work leads to potential privacy breaches.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to other students' submissions, and potentially even instructor test submissions.
- Leakage of sensitive coursework data.
- Violation of privacy and academic integrity.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- An authenticated student user can exploit the vulnerability by using the `download_all_submissions` feature and providing another user ID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A student account within the vulnerable Autolab system.
- Knowledge of the user ID for whom they want to download submissions.
