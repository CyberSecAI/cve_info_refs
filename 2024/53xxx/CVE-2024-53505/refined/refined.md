Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary root cause is the direct concatenation of user-controlled input into SQL query statements without proper sanitization or parameterization. This is evident in the `asset_content.go` file where the `id` parameter from the `/api/search/getAssetContent` endpoint is directly embedded into the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the lack of input sanitization or usage of prepared statements when building SQL queries. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `/api/search/getAssetContent` endpoint can be manipulated to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Boolean-based blind SQL Injection:**  Identified in `batchGetBlockAttrs`.
*   **SQL Injection:** In the `getAssetContent`, `searchHistory` and `getHistoryItems` functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Leakage:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database, including table names, column information, and potentially all data within the database.
*   **Arbitrary Data Access:** Attackers can bypass normal access controls, potentially modifying or deleting data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request Manipulation:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/api/search/getAssetContent` endpoint with a malicious SQL payload injected into the `id` parameter.
*   **SQLmap Tool:** The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) uses the `sqlmap` tool, which automates the process of finding and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Siyuan Note application's server, specifically to port 6806 according to the provided example.
*   **Knowledge of the API Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable API endpoint (`/api/search/getAssetContent`) and how to interact with it.
*   **SQL Injection Skills/Tools:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques or should have access to a tool like `sqlmap`.

**Additional Information from Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Siyuan Note application version 3.1.11 is identified as vulnerable.
*   **Specific Vulnerable Functions:** `batchGetBlockAttrs`, `getAssetContent`, `searchHistory` and `getHistoryItems` are all vulnerable.
*   **Fix Merged:** The fix for the `getAssetContent` SQL injection vulnerability was merged into issue #13077.
*   **Mitigation Recommendations:** The report suggests using parameterized queries or prepared statements, sanitizing user inputs, and implementing input validation and error handling.
*   **Code Snippet:** The vulnerable code in `asset_content.go` clearly shows the direct concatenation of the `id` parameter into the SQL query string.
*   **Exploitation Details:** The steps to reproduce the vulnerability using the `sqlmap` tool are outlined, including the necessary request payload and command-line parameters to list tables and dump data.

**CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to the identified SQL injection vulnerability affecting multiple functions, including `getAssetContent`, `batchGetBlockAttrs`, `searchHistory` and `getHistoryItems`  in the Siyuan Note application.

**Summary:**

The content details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Siyuan Note version 3.1.11 due to unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into SQL queries. This allows an attacker with network access to the application to extract sensitive information from the database.
