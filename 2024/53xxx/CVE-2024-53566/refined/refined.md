{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `action_listcategories()` function in Sangoma Asterisk does not properly sanitize the input `Filename` parameter, allowing for path traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive configuration information.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted `ListCategories` action through the Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI). The attacker provides a malicious file path in the `Filename` parameter to access files outside the intended directory.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to the AMI and be able to send commands through it."

  "affected_products": [
    "Sangoma Asterisk versions 22, 22.0.0, 22.0.0-rc1, 22.0.0-rc2, and 22.0.0-pre1"
