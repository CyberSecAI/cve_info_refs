In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: revert "mm: shmem: fix data-race in shmem_getattr()"

Revert d949d1d14fa2 ("mm: shmem: fix data-race in shmem_getattr()") as
suggested by Chuck [1].  It is causing deadlocks when accessing tmpfs over
NFS.

As Hugh commented, "added just to silence a syzbot sanitizer splat: added
where there has never been any practical problem".
