The provided content contains information about multiple reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Habitica. The vulnerabilities are related to the improper sanitization of the `redirectTo` parameter used in the login, register, and home pages.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the improper sanitization of the `redirectTo` parameter. The application uses a `sanitizeRedirect` function, but it was not sufficient to prevent XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected XSS in `/login` (GHSL-2024-109): The login function in `RegisterLoginReset.vue` incorrectly sanitizes the `redirectTo` parameter.
- Reflected XSS in `/register` (GHSL-2024-110): The register function in `RegisterLoginReset.vue` incorrectly sanitizes the `redirectTo` parameter.
- Reflected XSS in `/home` (GHSL-2024-111): The home page in `home.vue` also incorrectly sanitizes the `redirectTo` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's session.
- Attackers may be able to steal the victim's user ID and API key, potentially gaining full access to the victimâ€™s account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious link containing a `redirectTo` parameter with malicious JavaScript code.
- The attacker sends the malicious link to the victim, who then clicks it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking the malicious URL.

The provided GitHub commit diff shows the changes made to fix these vulnerabilities, specifically in `website/client/src/mixins/sanitizeRedirect.js`, where a more robust sanitization logic has been implemented.
