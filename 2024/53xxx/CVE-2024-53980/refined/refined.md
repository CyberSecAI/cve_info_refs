  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A vulnerability exists in the RIOT-OS implementation for CC2538 radio where a crafted IEEE 802.15.4 packet with a spoofed length byte can cause an endless loop in the receiver.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises because the receiver incorrectly checks for the CRC bit using the packet length byte, considering all 8 bits instead of discarding bit 7, as the radio does. This leads to reading outside of the RX FIFO.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect CRC check implementation leading to out-of-bounds read.",
        "Lack of proper handling for invalid packet lengths.",
        "Failure to recover from a specific error state, leading to an endless loop."
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious actor can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by sending a crafted packet, leading the receiving device into an endless loop, requiring a reboot to recover. The device becomes unresponsive and unable to perform its intended functions.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a crafted IEEE 802.15.4 packet with a spoofed length byte, specifically setting bit 7 of the length byte.",
        "Spoofing the FCS (Frame Check Sequence) to induce the error state consistently."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to transmit IEEE 802.15.4 packets. This can be done via a Software Defined Radio (SDR) or by modifying firmware to send invalid length bytes. The attacker needs to be within radio range of the target device. The attacker doesn't need to have any special access or credentials on the target device."
