NFSD: Prevent a potential integer overflow

If the tag length is >= U32_MAX - 3 then the "length + 4" addition
can result in an integer overflow. Address this by splitting the
decoding into several steps so that decode_cb_compound4res() does
not have to perform arithmetic on the unsafe length value.
