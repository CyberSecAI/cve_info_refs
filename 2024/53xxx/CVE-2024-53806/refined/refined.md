- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Maspik â€“ Spam blacklist plugin <= 2.2.7 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to potentially force a logged-in user to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact depends on the actions the plugin allows to be performed via a request and is described as having a low severity.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into submitting a crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, they just need to target an authenticated user.
