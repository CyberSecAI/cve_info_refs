Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the directory traversal vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `SecurityFilter.java` file of the `favorites-web` project. The filter uses `request.getRequestURI()` to obtain the requested URI, and then attempts to match it against a whitelist of URLs that do not require authentication. The matching logic uses `contains()` and `startsWith()` methods, which are vulnerable to directory traversal techniques such as `../`

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The use of `contains()` and `startsWith()` for URL matching without sanitizing or normalizing the input allows attackers to use directory traversal sequences (`../`) to bypass authentication.
- **Insecure Whitelist Matching:** The filter relies on simple string matching (`contains`, `startsWith`) against a whitelist, which is not robust enough to prevent bypasses via directory traversal.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize the request URI obtained from `request.getRequestURI()` which allows traversal sequences to be passed to the authorization checks

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and access privileged interfaces or resources without proper authorization. In the example provided, the attacker can access `/export` endpoint, which requires authentication, by requesting `/login/../export`.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Manipulated URL Paths:** Attackers can inject directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) into the requested URL path to bypass the security filter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability as that is what it is bypassing.
- The attacker needs to know an existing endpoint that requires authentication and an endpoint that is whitelisted.
