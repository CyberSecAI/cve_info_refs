- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Client-side Template Injection (CSTI) due to unsanitized user input in the "New project details" field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The application uses AngularJS, which is known to have vulnerabilities and sandbox bypass techniques that can be exploited through CSTI.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user viewing the affected project details. This can lead to stealing sensitive information, performing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and other high-impact exploits within the Taiga system.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting a template injection payload (e.g., `{{7*7}}`) into the "New project details" input field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs the ability to create or modify project details, typically requiring user or administrator privileges within the Taiga system.
