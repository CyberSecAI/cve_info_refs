In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential out-of-bound accesses for Extigy and Mbox devices

A bogus device can provide a bNumConfigurations value that exceeds the
initial value used in usb_get_configuration for allocating dev->config.

This can lead to out-of-bounds accesses later, e.g. in
usb_destroy_configuration.
