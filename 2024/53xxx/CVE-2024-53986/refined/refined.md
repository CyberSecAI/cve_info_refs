Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-53986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a namespace confusion issue within the `rails-html-sanitizer` library when processing HTML content containing `math` and `style` tags, specifically when HTML5 sanitization is enabled. When both `math` and `style` elements are explicitly allowed in the sanitizer's configuration, it can lead to unexpected behavior. Specifically, when these tags are used in combination with other tags such as `<mtext>` and `<mglyph>`, they can be exploited to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the possibility of injecting malicious scripts into the HTML output, leading to XSS. This occurs because the sanitizer fails to properly handle nested tags within the `math` and `style` elements, allowing attackers to bypass the sanitization process. The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting a `style` tag inside `<math>`, along with other tags like `mtext` and `mglyph` and event handlers such as `onerror` inside `img` tags.

- **Namespace Confusion:** The core issue is a namespace confusion when sanitizing `math` and `svg` tags, specifically when they are disallowed by default, but then allowed in the configuration. This means that the sanitizer fails to correctly identify and sanitize content within these tags when they are explicitly allowed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:

- Inject arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to various malicious actions on the victim's browser (e.g. session hijacking, redirecting user to a malicious website, data exfiltration, etc.).
- Deface web pages.
- Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or actions within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves crafting malicious HTML payloads that include the combination of "math" and "style" tags, along with other elements such as `mtext`, `mglyph`, and `img`. The specific payloads mentioned in the test cases are:
    -  `<svg><style><style class='</style><script>alert(1)</script>'>`
    -  `<math><style><style class='</style><script>alert(1)</script>'>`
    -  `<math><mtext><table><mglyph><style><img src=: onerror=alert(1)>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to provide input that is processed by the vulnerable sanitizer and displayed to a user's browser. This might be achieved through user-generated content, such as comments or posts, or through other data sources that are sanitized by the application.
- The application needs to be configured to use HTML5 sanitization, and both the "math" and "style" elements must be explicitly allowed as safe tags through any one of the methods described in the advisory.

**Additional Details from Provided Content:**

- The vulnerability is specific to version 1.6.0 of `rails-html-sanitizer` and is fixed in version 1.6.1.
- The issue only affects applications that have overridden the default allowed tags of the sanitizer to include both "math" and "style" elements.
- The content provides specific code examples of how applications might have overridden the allowed tags, highlighting different possible ways, such as application configuration, helper methods and class or instance level options.
- The content includes references to the original HackerOne reports that prompted the fix.
- The provided patch addresses the namespace issue by pruning nodes with namespaces unless explicitly configured not to do so.
- The content includes test cases that demonstrate the vulnerability and verify that the fix is effective.

In summary, CVE-2024-53986 is an XSS vulnerability in `rails-html-sanitizer` version 1.6.0 when HTML5 sanitization is used and both `math` and `style` tags are allowed. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of namespaces which can be exploited by attackers by injecting malicious HTML payloads. Applications should upgrade to version 1.6.1 or implement the suggested workarounds.
