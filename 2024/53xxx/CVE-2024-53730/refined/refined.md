- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The April's Call Posts WordPress plugin (versions <= 2.1.1) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force logged-in users to perform unwanted actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions, which can vary depending on the specific vulnerable functions within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious link or web page that, when visited by a logged-in user, will trigger an action on the vulnerable website without the user's knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user to visit a malicious link or webpage. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
