- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a single DLL file within Adobe FrameMaker on Windows.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring user interaction (UI:R)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and trick a user into opening a specially crafted file or performing a specific action to trigger the vulnerability, as user interaction (UI:R) is required. The attacker does not need special privileges (PR:N).
