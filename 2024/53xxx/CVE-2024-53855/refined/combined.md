# User can view tickets from organizations they're not apart of

Low

[jon-nfc](/jon-nfc)
published
GHSA-h9q2-fcc6-r65c
Nov 27, 2024

## Package

Centurion ERP

## Affected versions

>=1.2.0,<=1.3.0

## Patched versions

1.3.1

## Description

### Impact

A user who is authenticated and has view permissions for a ticket, can view the tickets of another organization they are not apart of. Users with following permissions are applicable:

* `view_ticket_change` permission can view change tickets from organizations they are not apart of
* `view_ticket_incident` permission can view incident tickets from organizations they are not apart of
* `view_ticket_request` permission can view request tickets from organizations they are not apart of
* `view_ticket_problem` permission can view problem tickets from organizations they are not apart of

The access to view the tickets from different organizations is only applicable when browsing the API endpoints for the tickets in question. The Centurion UI is not affected. Project Tasks, although a "ticket type" are also **Not** affected.

### Patches

Upgrading to v1.3.1 is recommended.

### Workarounds

Removing the ticket view permssions from users would allieviate this vulnerability, this is deemed not-viable, Upgrading is recommended.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
