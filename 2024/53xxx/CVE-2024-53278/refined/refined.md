    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the admin interface
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious admin user: An attacker needs to have administrative privileges to customize the admin screen.
- Input injection: The attacker injects malicious script through the plugin's admin customization features.
- Other users access the admin screen: The injected script executes when other users access the modified admin pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Administrator access: The attacker must have administrative privileges to modify the admin interface using the plugin.
