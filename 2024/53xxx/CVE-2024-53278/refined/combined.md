More than 1 year ago I tried to track the plugin but it is not updated, it does not respond to the options it supposedly provides, I hope they can resume the update soon, the problem is that I do not know how I will find out when they manage to do it, it hurts 🙁

Simple and does exactly what I need, particularly re-organizing the Sidebar. Some of the newer all-purpose themes come with a slew of builtin plugin-type features. For example, Qode’s Bridge theme. But a good many of these, I don’t use on any particular site. This plugin allows me to completely re-organize the sidebar such that the items I need are at the top and prioritized the way I use them!

# WP Admin UI Customize アップデート(1.5.14)をしました

WordPress プラグイン[「WP Admin UI Customize」](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-admin-ui-customize/) に脆弱性があるよ～とご連絡いただき、久しぶりに[WP Admin UI Customize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-admin-ui-customize/) (1.5.14) をアップデートしました。

> [WP Admin UI Customize](https://ja.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-admin-ui-customize/)

今回はセキュリティアップデート(XSS対策）となり、[WP Admin UI Customize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-admin-ui-customize/) 1.5.14より前のバージョンすべて影響を受けますので、プラグインをアップデートすることをおすすめします。 🙂

[WP Admin UI Customize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-admin-ui-customize/) を更新する予定は特になかったのですが、前回 [WP Admin UI Customize](https://gqevu6bsiz.chicappa.jp/wp-admin-ui-customize-%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%83%87%E3%83%BC%E3%83%881-5-13%E3%82%92%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%81%97%E3%81%9F/) 1.5.13 の脆弱性のご連絡に続き、今回も脆弱性の報告をいただいたので、その修正のために約2年ぶりに更新しました。

脆弱性の内容としては、管理画面のカスタマイズのなかで一部の項目でJavascriptが実行できてしまう可能性があり、これを修正しています。 🙂

ちなみに今回は、[JPCERT/CC](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/)さんより脆弱性のご連絡を受け、[JVN](https://jvn.jp/)に[アドバイザリ「JVN#87182660」](https://jvn.jp/jp/JVN87182660/index.html)が公開されています。

普段私は脆弱性の最新情報を[JVN](https://jvn.jp/)で見るだけで、[JVN](https://jvn.jp/)はどういう仕組みで[IPA](https://www.ipa.go.jp/)がどういう仕組みとかほとんど意識していなかったのですが、今回はおそらく[JVN](https://jvn.jp/)に掲載されるまでの事が必要という事なので、ちょっと仕組みが分からないと進める事も難しいな～と思い、色々参考にしながら進めました。

何をどうすればいいのか、どういう関係図で、何をどこに連絡したらいいのか、さっぱり分からない状態からのスタートでしたが、[JPCERT/CC](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/)さんのご説明を受けつつ、何とかなったっぽいです。 😳

もし私と同じように[JPCERT/CC](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/)さんから脆弱性のご連絡を受けて、何をどういう風に進めたらいいんだろうという人がいれば、「[JPCERT/CC – 脆弱性情報ハンドリングとは？](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/vh/)」の「調整機関のポジションと調整プロセス」という、脆弱性の発見から[JVN](https://jvn.jp/)に公開されるまでのおおまかな流れ図があるので、それを参考にすると進めやすいと思います。

脆弱性発見のご連絡をしていただいた佐藤芽生様、脆弱性をご連絡していただきありがとうございました。

[JPCERT/CC](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/)のご担当者様、[JVN](https://jvn.jp/)への公開までご協力いただきありがとうございました。
