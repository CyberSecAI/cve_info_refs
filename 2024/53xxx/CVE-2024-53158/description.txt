In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: qcom: geni-se: fix array underflow in geni_se_clk_tbl_get()

This loop is supposed to break if the frequency returned from
clk_round_rate() is the same as on the previous iteration.  However,
that check doesn't make sense on the first iteration through the loop.
It leads to reading before the start of these->clk_perf_tbl[] array.
