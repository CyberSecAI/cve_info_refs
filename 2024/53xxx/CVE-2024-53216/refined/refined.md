The provided content details a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's NFS server (nfsd) related to the handling of `svc_expkey` and `svc_export` structures.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from incorrect handling of reference counts and freeing of resources associated with NFS exports. Specifically, the `svc_export_put` function directly frees the `ex_uuid` member of the `svc_export` structure. However, the `e_show` and `c_show` functions can still access this `ex_uuid` after the structure has been put (and potentially freed), leading to a use-after-free condition. Additionally, the `svc_export_put` and `expkey_put` functions could sleep, while called under RCU read lock, due to the call to `path_put` which can trigger a `dput`, which could sleep.

**Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free in `svc_export_show` due to the premature freeing of `ex_uuid` in `svc_export_put` while the `e_show/c_show` functions still hold a reference via `cache_head`.
2.  **Sleeping in RCU Read Lock:** The `svc_export_put` and `expkey_put` functions, when called under `rcu_read_lock` and `rcu_read_unlock`, can invoke `path_put` which could lead to sleeping in a RCU read locked section, which is not allowed

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The use-after-free vulnerability could lead to a kernel crash, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- Sleeping in RCU read lock could also lead to kernel crash and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the NFS server to trigger the premature freeing of `ex_uuid` while the show functions, `e_show` or `c_show` try to access it.
- It would involve interacting with the NFS server via file system operations or by modifying the exports via nfsctl.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to interact with the NFS server on the target system. This means they would either need to be local users or have network access to the NFS server if it was exposed.

The provided patches address these issues by using `rcu_work` to delay the freeing of `svc_expkey` and `svc_export`.  This ensures that `path_put` is invoked in an asynchronous context to prevent the RCU read lock issue and the `uuid/exp/key` are freed after a RCU grace period to prevent the UAF.
