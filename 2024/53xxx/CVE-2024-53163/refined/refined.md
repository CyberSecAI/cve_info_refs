Based on the provided information, this content is related to **CVE-2024-53163**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an off-by-one error in the `uof_get_name()` function within the `qat_420xx` driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- An out-of-bounds read could occur due to an incorrect boundary check. The code was checking for `< num_objs` instead of `>= num_objs` which would allow `id` to be equal to `num_objs`, resulting in an out-of-bounds access on `fw_objs[id]`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An out-of-bounds read could potentially lead to information disclosure. The impact is limited to reading from memory outside of the intended array, but this could contain sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `uof_get_name()` function is called, which is part of the QAT (Quick Assist Technology) driver for Intel 420xx devices.
- An attacker would need to interact with the QAT driver in a way that leads to the execution of the vulnerable code path in `uof_get_name()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to interact with the QAT driver.
- The attacker needs to be able to call `uof_get_name` with an object number that causes `id` to be equal to `num_objs`.
