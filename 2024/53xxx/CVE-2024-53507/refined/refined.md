The provided content relates to CVE-2024-53507.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of user-supplied input in the `getHistoryItems` endpoint of the Siyuan Note application. Specifically, the `created` parameter within the request is directly concatenated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or use of parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct concatenation of user-controlled data into the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL query execution: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, enabling them to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database.
- Data extraction: The attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database, including table names and potentially user data.
- Unauthorized access: By exploiting the SQL injection, attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to the system's data.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/api/history/getHistoryItems` endpoint.
- Malicious payload: The malicious SQL payload is included within the `created` parameter of the request body.
- Direct concatenation into SQL query: The vulnerable code directly appends the unsanitized `created` parameter into the SQL query, allowing for the injection to occur.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the Siyuan Note application server.
- Knowledge of the API endpoint: The attacker needs knowledge of the `/api/history/getHistoryItems` endpoint.
- Ability to craft HTTP requests: The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests with a crafted payload.
- No authentication: The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
