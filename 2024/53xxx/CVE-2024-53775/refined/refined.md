- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress DancePress (TRWA) plugin <= 3.1.11 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions while authenticated. The specific impact depends on the actions available within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into triggering it. The attacker does not need to have any privileged access on the target system. The attacker does not require prior authentication.
