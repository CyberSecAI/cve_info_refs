  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of `IP_PMTUDISC_DO` socket option on Linux, which allows the kernel to track the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) based on the 4-tuple (source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port). An attacker can inject an ICMP Packet Too Large message to manipulate the tracked MTU value.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The affected versions of quic-go used `IP_PMTUDISC_DO` which enables the kernel's MTU tracking and can be influenced by off-path ICMP Packet Too Large injection.",
         "The lack of proper handling of ICMP Packet Too Large messages allowing for an attacker to force a lower MTU."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection by injecting an ICMP Packet Too Large message with an MTU value smaller than the QUIC minimum of 1200 bytes. This attack can be performed after the handshake, bypassing TCP fallback mechanisms implemented at the application layer.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "Off-path network attack: An attacker injects an ICMP 'Packet Too Large' message."
      ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Off-path attacker position to inject ICMP Packet Too Large messages.",
        "Knowledge of the client's IP and port tuple (and server's IP and port).",
        "Ability to send forged ICMP messages."
      ],
    "additional_details": [
        "The fix involves using `IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE` instead of `IP_PMTUDISC_DO`, disabling kernel's MTU tracking, only sets the DF bit.",
        "A workaround is to use iptables to drop ICMP Unreachable packets.",
        "The kernel tracks the MTU per 4-tuple, requiring the attacker to know the client's IP and port.",
        "This issue was discovered during research for an IETF draft on IP fragmentation."
