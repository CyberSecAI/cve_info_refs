The provided document details multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2024-53912, affecting Veritas Enterprise Vault, Discovery Accelerator, and Compliance Accelerator/Veritas Surveillance Server.

**CVE-2024-53912 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability in .NET Remoting TCP ports used by Veritas Enterprise Vault services.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The application starts services that listen on random .NET Remoting TCP ports.
    *   These TCP ports can be exploited via vulnerabilities inherent to the .NET Remoting service.
    *   Both TCP remoting services and local IPC services are vulnerable on the affected servers.
    *   The vulnerability allows an attacker to send specially crafted data.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attack, exploiting .NET Remoting TCP ports and local IPC services.
    *   Requires sending specially crafted data to a vulnerable server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   RDP access to one of the VMs in the network with the attacker being part of the Remote Desktop Users group.
    *   Knowledge of the IP address of the EV server.
    *   Knowledge of the EV process IDs (random)
    *   Knowledge of the EV TCP dynamic ports (random).
    *   Knowledge of the EV remoteable object URIs.
    *   The firewall on the EV server must not be properly configured to block this type of attack.

**Affected Versions:** All currently supported versions of Enterprise Vault versions: 15.1, 15.0, 15.0.1, 15.0.2, 14.5, 14.5.2, 14.5.1, 14.4, 14.4.1, 14.4.2, 14.3, 14.3.1, 14.3.2, 14.2, 14.2.3, 14.2.2, 14.2.1, 14.1.3, 14.1.2, 14.1.1, 14.1, 14.0.1, 14.0. Earlier unsupported versions may be affected as well.

**Mitigation:**

*   Restrict access to the Enterprise Vault server to EV administrators.
*   Ensure only trusted users are part of the Remote Desktop Users group with RDP access.
*   Ensure the Enterprise Vault server firewall is enabled and properly configured.
*   Ensure the latest Windows updates are installed on the Enterprise Vault server.
*   For Discovery Accelerator, and Compliance Accelerator/Veritas Surveillance server, ensure only trusted users have RDP access and the firewall blocks traffic on ports 8085 and 8086 except from client machines.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory indicates that the vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 (Critical).
*   Veritas plans to remediate these vulnerabilities in Enterprise Vault 15.2, with a General Availability expected in the third quarter of CY25.
*   The vulnerabilities were reported by Sina Kheirkhah working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
