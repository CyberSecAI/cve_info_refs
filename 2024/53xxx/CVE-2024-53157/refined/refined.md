Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-53157.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability occurs because the kernel does not check the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) Operating Performance Point (OPP) count returned by the System Control and Power Interface (SCPI) firmware. If the firmware returns an OPP count of zero, the kernel attempts to dereference a null pointer, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing check for zero OPP count from SCPI firmware.
- Dereferencing a null pointer in `kcalloc` when OPP count is zero.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash and system instability.
- Denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the SCPI firmware returns a zero OPP count, which can occur during reboot or during specific operating conditions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker does not directly trigger the vulnerability. Rather, it's triggered by the system when the firmware returns an invalid value during normal operations or during specific events (reboot).
