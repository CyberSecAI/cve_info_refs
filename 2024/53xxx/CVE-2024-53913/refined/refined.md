Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-53913

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the deserialization of untrusted data within the .NET Remoting services used by Veritas Enterprise Vault, Discovery Accelerator, and Compliance Accelerator/Veritas Surveillance Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core weakness lies in the application's failure to properly validate and sanitize data during deserialization, allowing attackers to inject malicious payloads.
*   **Inherent .NET Remoting Vulnerabilities:** The reliance on .NET Remoting, which has known vulnerabilities, exacerbates the risk.
*   **Open TCP Ports:** The services listen on random TCP ports for client commands, which can be exploited if the ports are accessible.
*   **Local IPC Services Vulnerable:** Local inter-process communication services are also vulnerable to exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected server.
*   **Complete Compromise:** RCE can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, manipulation, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **.NET Remoting TCP ports:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the server's .NET Remoting TCP ports.
*   **Specially Crafted Data:** The attacker needs to send specially crafted, malicious data to the vulnerable server for deserialization.
*   **Local IPC:** Attackers can also exploit local inter-process communication services

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **RDP access to a VM on the network:** The attacker needs Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to at least one of the virtual machines on the network where the Enterprise Vault server resides. The attacker needs to be part of the Remote Desktop Users group.
*   **Knowledge of EV infrastructure:** The attacker must know the IP address of the EV server, the EV process IDs (which are random), the EV TCP dynamic ports (which are also random), and the EV remoteable object URIs.
*   **Bypassed Firewall:** The firewall on the EV server must be improperly configured, allowing the malicious data to reach the vulnerable services.

**Additional Information:**
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is considered critical and has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   The vulnerability affects all currently supported versions of Enterprise Vault, listed in the advisory.
*   The advisory provides mitigation steps, including restricting user access, properly configuring the firewall, and ensuring that all Windows updates have been installed.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in version 15.2, expected to be released in the third quarter of CY25.
