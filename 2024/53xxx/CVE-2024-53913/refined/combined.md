| 1 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability | Critical | ZDI-CAN-24334 | [CVE-2024-53909](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53909) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability | Critical | ZDI-CAN-24336 | [CVE-2024-53910](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53910) |
| 3 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability | Critical | ZDI-CAN-24339 | [CVE-2024-53911](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53911) |
| 4 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability | Critical | ZDI-CAN-24341 | [CVE-2024-53912](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53912) |
| 5 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability | Critical | ZDI-CAN-24343 | [CVE-2024-53913](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53913) |
| 6 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability | Critical | ZDI-CAN-24344 | [CVE-2024-53914](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53914) |
| 7 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability | Critical | ZDI-CAN-24405 | [CVE-2024-53915](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53915) |

### **Issue**

* CVE ID: See above
* Severity: Critical
* CVSS v3.1 Base Score 9.8 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

On start-up, the Enterprise Vault application starts several services that listen on random .NET Remoting TCP ports for possible commands from client applications. These TCP ports can be exploited due to vulnerabilities that are inherent to the .NET Remoting service. A malicious attacker can exploit both TCP remoting services and local IPC services on the Enterprise Vault and Discovery Accelerator, and Compliance Accelerator/Veritas Surveillance Server.

This vulnerability affects Enterprise Vault server if and only if all the following pre-requisites are fulfilled:

* The malicious attacker has RDP access to one of the VMs in the network. In order to have RDP access the attacker needs to be part of the Remote Desktop Users group.
* The malicious attacker knows the IP address of the EV server, the EV process IDs (random), EV TCP dynamic ports (random), EV remoteable object URIs.
* The firewall on the EV server is not properly configured

This vulnerability could allow remote code execution if an attacker sends specially crafted data to a vulnerable EV server.

**Affected Versions**

All currently supported versions of Enterprise Vault versions: 15.1, 15.0, 15.0.1, 15.0.2, 14.5, 14.5.2, 14.5.1, 14.4, 14.4.1, 14.4.2, 14.3, 14.3.1, 14.3.2, 14.2, 14.2.3, 14.2.2, 14.2.1, 14.1.3, 14.1.2, 14.1.1, 14.1, 14.0.1, 14.0. Earlier unsupported versions may be affected as well.

### **Mitigation**

The Enterprise Vault server can be protected from such .NET Remoting attacks by applying the following guidelines:

* Ensure that only EV Administrators have access to the Enterprise Vault server as described in the [Enterprise Vault Administrator’s Guide](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/11765145-146140116-0/v11737934-146140116).
  + See [Managing Administrator Security](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/11765145-146140116-0/v11738019-146140116)
* Ensure only trusted users are part of the Remote Desktop Users group and have RDP access to the Enterprise Vault server.
* Ensure that the Enterprise Vault server firewall is enabled and properly configured as described in the [Enterprise Vault Administrator’s Guide](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/11765145-146140116-0/v11737934-146140116)
  + See: [Firewall settings for Enterprise Vault programs](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/doc/11765145-146140116-0/v69906976-146140116)
* Ensure that the latest Windows updates have been installed on the Enterprise Vault server.

The Discovery Accelerator, and Compliance Accelerator/Veritas Surveillance server can be protected from such .NET Remoting attacks by applying the following guideline:

* Ensure only trusted users are part of the Remote Desktop Users group and have RDP access to the respective server. On client machines, allow only legitimate Discovery Accelerator or Compliance Accelerator/Veritas Surveillance users to logon.
* Ensure respective server firewall is enabled and properly configured so that it blocks all incoming traffic from port 8085 and 8086 from all machines except where the client applications are installed.

Veritas plans to remediate these vulnerabilities in Enterprise Vault 15.2, with General Availability expected in the third quarter of CY25.
