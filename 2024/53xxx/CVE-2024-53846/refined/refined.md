{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A regression was introduced into the ssl application of OTP, causing it to incorrectly verify the peer when the extended key usage is not correct. The server will verify a client if they have server auth ext key usage and vice versa. This is due to a silent error during certificate verification, which results in the session being established if a verify_fun is not used to explicitly reject an 'unknown' reason.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A server might accept a client certificate that has the wrong extended key usage, leading to a security vulnerability where a client is authorized when it shouldn't be and potentially escalating access.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network; The vulnerability is exploitable when a client and server using the vulnerable Erlang OTP SSL implementation with mutual TLS have mismatched key usages.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to present a certificate with an incorrect extended key usage during the TLS handshake. This often involves an attacker having control over the certificate presented by the client (in the case of client authentication against a server, and vice-versa), and the server using the vulnerable version."
