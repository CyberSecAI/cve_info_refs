- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The LibreNMS application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Display Name" field when editing device settings. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "Display Name" field when editing a device through the LibreNMS interface.
    - The injected payload is stored and then executed when a user views the device's edit page, specifically when navigating to the "Alert Rules" or "Custom OID" sections, when accessing the "/apps" path, or on the "/ports" path when hovering over the modified "Port" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have access to the LibreNMS interface and the ability to add and edit devices. This implies having a valid user account with the necessary privileges within the LibreNMS instance.
