In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ima: fix buffer overrun in ima_eventdigest_init_common

Function ima_eventdigest_init() calls ima_eventdigest_init_common()
with HASH_ALGO__LAST which is then used to access the array
hash_digest_size[] leading to buffer overrun. Have a conditional
statement to handle this.
