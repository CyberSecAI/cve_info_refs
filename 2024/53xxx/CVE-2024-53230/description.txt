In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpufreq: CPPC: Fix possible null-ptr-deref for cppc_get_cpu_cost()

cpufreq_cpu_get_raw() may return NULL if the cpu is not in
policy->cpus cpu mask and it will cause null pointer dereference,
so check NULL for cppc_get_cpu_cost().
