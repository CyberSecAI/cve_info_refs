- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CultBooking Hotel Booking Engine Plugin <= 2.1 for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is executed through CSRF, where a malicious site/actor forces a logged-in user's browser to send requests to the vulnerable site, triggering unintended actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site, which then sends a crafted request to the vulnerable WordPress site. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the vulnerable site but does need an active session of a legitimate authenticated user.
