Fix a few more stack buffer overflows

Several overflows may occur in switch case '[' when the input pattern
contains many escaped characters. The added backslashes leave too little
space in the output pattern when processing nested brackets such that
the remaining input length exceeds the output capacity. Therefore all
these concatenations must also be checked.

The ADD_CHAR was missed in [41281ea](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c/commit/41281ea82fbf24b060a9f69b9c5369350fb0529e) ([#87](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c/pull/87)). The switch can exit exactly at
capacity, leaving no room for the finishing '$', causing an overflow.

These overflows were discovered through fuzz testing with afl.

### @skeeto **[skeeto](/skeeto)** commented [Feb 17, 2024](#issue-2140624299)

Several overflows may occur in switch `case '['` when the input pattern contains many escaped characters. The added backslashes leave too little space in the output pattern when processing nested brackets such that the remaining input length exceeds the output capacity. Therefore all these concatenations must also be checked.

The `ADD_CHAR` was missed in [41281ea](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c/commit/41281ea82fbf24b060a9f69b9c5369350fb0529e) ([#87](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c/pull/87)). The switch can exit exactly at capacity, leaving no room for the finishing `'$'`, causing an overflow.

In `STRING_CAT`, the end pointer is positioned one past the end of the destination, and it is undefined behavior to compute an address beyond the end pointer, including for comparisons, even temporarily. The UB occurs exactly when buffer overflow would have occurred, so the buffer overflow check could be optimized away by compilers. Even if this wasn't the case, the check could produce a false negative if the computed address overflowed the address space, which is, after all, why the C standard doesn't define behavior in the first place.

The fix is simple: Check using sizes, not addresses. The explicit cast suppresses warnings around signed-unsigned comparisons. It would also be worthwhile to `assert(end > p)`, which would have caught some of these issues sooner, but there is no established assertion discipline and I didn't want to introduce it here.

---

These issues were discovered with this quick-and-dirty afl fuzz target:

```
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#define PCRE2_CODE_UNIT_WIDTH 8
#define UNIX
#define EC_VERSION_SUFFIX ""
#define EC_VERSION_MAJOR 0
#define EC_VERSION_MINOR 0
#define EC_VERSION_PATCH 0
#include "src/lib/ec_glob.c"
#include "src/lib/editorconfig.c"
#include "src/lib/ini.c"
#include "src/lib/misc.c"
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>

__AFL_FUZZ_INIT();

int main(void)
{
    __AFL_INIT();
    int fd = memfd_create("fuzz", 0);
    unsigned char *buf = __AFL_FUZZ_TESTCASE_BUF;
    while (__AFL_LOOP(10000)) {
        int len = __AFL_FUZZ_TESTCASE_LEN;
        ftruncate(fd, 0);
        write(fd, buf, len);
        struct editorconfig_handle ec = {0};
        ec.conf_file_name = (char[]){'0'+fd, 0};
        editorconfig_parse("/proc/self/fd/", &ec);
    }
}
```

The interface only accepts input through a file path, which makes testing a bit more complex. `memfd_create()` avoids writing fuzz input through a real file and allows for parallel fuzzing because the virtual file path is private. I built and ran it like so:

```
$ echo >include/config.h
$ afl-gcc-fast -Iinclude -g3 -fsanitize=address,undefined fuzz.c -lpcre2-8
$ afl-fuzz -i tests/parser/comments.in -o fuzzout ./a.out

```

[overflow-input.txt](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c/files/14320240/overflow-input.txt) is an input that triggers all overflows addressed by these commits.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Thanks for the contribution and detailed commit message! The PR looks good, only two minor comments.

> ...the end pointer is positioned one past the end of the destination, and it is undefined behavior to compute an address beyond the end pointer...

* Do you have a reference to this?
* Is using the address one past the end of an array defined behavior?

Sorry, something went wrong.

The ADD_CHAR was missed in [41281ea](https://github.com/skeeto/editorconfig-core-c/commit/41281ea82fbf24b060a9f69b9c5369350fb0529e) ([editorconfig#87](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c/pull/87)). The switch can exit exactly at
capacity, leaving no room for the finishing '$', causing an overflow.

These overflows were discovered through fuzz testing with afl.

be optimized away by compilers. Even if this wasn't the case, the check

| - Do you have a reference to this? - Is using the address one past the end of an array defined behavior? C99 6.5.6-8 answers both at once:  If both the pointer operand and the result point to elements of the same array object, or one past the last element of the array object, the evaluation shall not produce an overflow; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. One past the end makes so many things simpler, including cases like this, which is why it's permitted despite its special cases. Some languages do not allow one-past-the-end pointers, and it's surprising how much more complicated, and error prone, programs become as a result. I've made the two suggestions and updated the second commit message to match. As the first assertion, I didn't want to make a decision about dealing with -DNDEBUG in the build. (This particular case is a great example of why sizes ought to be signed, and why I use ptrdiff\_t for memory quantities in my own programs. Without edge cases near zero, many problems evaporate. The maximum object size is PTRDIFF\_MAX either implicitly or explicitly (e.g. in GCC and Clang), so a strlen result, and especially this one, cannot exceed it despite returning size\_t.) |

# Several stack buffer overflows and pointer overflows

High

[xuhdev](/xuhdev)
published
GHSA-475j-wc37-6274
Nov 26, 2024

## Package

EditorConfig C Core

## Affected versions

< 0.12.7

## Patched versions

0.12.7

## Description

### Impact

Several overflows may occur in switch case '[' when the input pattern contains many escaped characters. The added backslashes leave too little space in the output pattern when processing nested brackets such that the remaining input length exceeds the output capacity.

### Patches

Fixed in [4d5518a](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c/commit/4d5518a0a4e4910c37281ab13a048d0d86999782) and [a8dd531](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c/commit/a8dd5312e08abeab95ff5656d32ed3cb85fba70b), or update to 0.12.7 or later.

# EditorConfig

## What is EditorConfig?

EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of **a file format** for defining coding styles and a collection of **text editor plugins** that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.

## What's an EditorConfig file look like?

*(A [formal specification of EditorConfig](https://spec.editorconfig.org/) is also available.)*

### Example file

Below is an example `.editorconfig` file setting end-of-line and indentation styles for Python and JavaScript files.

```
# EditorConfig is awesome: https://editorconfig.org

# top-most EditorConfig file
root = true

# Unix-style newlines with a newline ending every file
[*]
end_of_line = lf
insert_final_newline = true

# Matches multiple files with brace expansion notation
# Set default charset
[*.{js,py}]
charset = utf-8

# 4 space indentation
[*.py]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4

# Tab indentation (no size specified)
[Makefile]
indent_style = tab

# Indentation override for all JS under lib directory
[lib/**.js]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2

# Matches the exact files either package.json or .travis.yml
[{package.json,.travis.yml}]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
```

Check the Wiki for some real-world examples of [projects using EditorConfig files](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/Projects-Using-EditorConfig).

### Where are these files stored?

When opening a file, EditorConfig plugins look for a file named `.editorconfig` in the directory of the opened file and in every parent directory. A search for `.editorconfig` files will stop if the root filepath is reached or an EditorConfig file with `root=true` is found.

EditorConfig files are read top to bottom and the most recent rules found take precedence. Properties from matching EditorConfig sections are applied in the order they were read, so properties in closer files take precedence.

**For Windows Users:** To create an `.editorconfig` file within Windows Explorer, you need to create a file named `.editorconfig.` (note the trailing dot), which Windows Explorer will automatically rename to `.editorconfig` for you.

### File Format Details

EditorConfig files use an INI format that is compatible with the format used by [Python ConfigParser Library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html), but `[` and `]` are allowed in the section names. The section names are filepath [globs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29) (case sensitive), similar to the format accepted by [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format). Only forward slashes (`/`, not backslashes) are used as path separators and octothorpes (`#`) or semicolons (`;`) are used for comments. Comments should go on their own lines. EditorConfig files should be UTF-8 encoded, with either `CRLF` or `LF` line separators. EditorConfig files are read top to bottom and the most recent rules found take precedence.

Filepath glob patterns and currently-supported EditorConfig properties are explained below.

#### Wildcard Patterns

Special characters recognized in section names for wildcard matching:

| `*` | Matches any string of characters, except path separators (`/`) |
| --- | --- |
| `**` | Matches any string of characters |
| `?` | Matches any single character |
| `[name]` | Matches any single character in *name* |
| `[!name]` | Matches any single character not in *name* |
| `{s1,s2,s3}` | Matches any of the strings given (separated by commas) (**Available since EditorConfig Core 0.11.0**) |
| `{num1..num2}` | Matches any integer numbers between *num1* and *num2*, where num1 and num2 can be either positive or negative |

Special characters can be escaped with a backslash so they won't be interpreted as wildcard patterns.

#### Supported Properties

Note that not all properties are supported by every plugin. The wiki has a [complete list of properties](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/EditorConfig-Properties).

* `indent_style`: set to tab or space to use hard tabs or soft tabs respectively.
* `indent_size`: a whole number defining the number of columns used for each indentation level and the width of soft tabs (when supported). When set to tab, the value of **`tab_width`** (if specified) will be used.
* `tab_width`: a whole number defining the number of columns used to represent a tab character. This defaults to the value of **`indent_size`** and doesn't usually need to be specified.
* `end_of_line`: set to lf, cr, or crlf to control how line breaks are represented.
* `charset`: set to latin1, utf-8, utf-8-bom, utf-16be or utf-16le to control the character set.
* `trim_trailing_whitespace`: set to true to remove any whitespace characters preceding newline characters and false to ensure it doesn't.
* `insert_final_newline`: set to true to ensure file ends with a newline when saving and false to ensure it doesn't.
* `root`: special property that should be specified at the top of the file outside of any sections. Set to true to stop `.editorconfig` files search on current file.

Currently all properties and values are case-insensitive. They are lowercased when parsed. Generally, if a property is not specified, the editor settings will be used, i.e. EditorConfig takes no effect on that part. For any property, a value of unset is to remove the effect of that property, even if it has been set before. For example, add `indent_size = unset` to undefine **`indent_size`** property (and use editor default).

It is acceptable and often preferred to leave certain EditorConfig properties unspecified. For example, **`tab_width`** need not be specified unless it differs from the value of **`indent_size`**. Also, when **`indent_style`** is set to tab, it may be desirable to leave **`indent_size`** unspecified so readers may view the file using their preferred indentation width. Additionally, if a property is not standardized in your project (**`end_of_line`** for example), it may be best to leave it blank.

## No Plugin Necessary

These editors come bundled with native support for EditorConfig. Everything should just work.

## Contributing to EditorConfig

### Give us your feedback

This project is greatly in need of feedback from other developers. We want to hear ideas about how to make this project better. Please use the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/editorconfig) to send an email to the EditorConfig team (subscribe by shooting an email to editorconfig+subscribe@googlegroups.com) and use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/issues) to submit bugs (but please take a look at the [FAQ](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/FAQ) first). Also feel free to [tweet at us](https://twitter.com/EditorConfig).

### Create an editor plugin

EditorConfig editor plugins must follow the [specifications](https://spec.editorconfig.org). They can be developed with the help from one of the EditorConfig core libraries.
The EditorConfig core libraries accept as input the file being edited, find and parse relevant `.editorconfig` files, and pass back the properties that should be used.
Please ignore any unrecognized properties and property values in your editor plugin for future compatibility, since new properties and permitted values will be added in the future.

EditorConfig core libraries exist for many programming languages:

* [C library](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-c#readme)
* [Python library](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-py#readme)
* [JavaScript library](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-js#readme)
* Java libraries: [EditorConfig Core Java](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-java#readme) and [ec4j](https://github.com/ec4j/ec4j#readme)
* [Lua library](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-lua#readme)
* [.NET library](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-net#readme)
* [Ruby library](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-ruby)
* [Go library](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-core-go)
* [Rust library](https://github.com/TheDaemoness/ec4rs)

If you are planning on creating a new plugin, use the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/editorconfig) to let us know so we can help out and link to your plugin once it's created. If you plan on using one of the EditorConfig cores as a library or command line interface, the [C library documentation](http://docs.editorconfig.org), [Python library documentation](http://pydocs.editorconfig.org) or [Java library documentation](http://javadocs.editorconfig.org) may be helpful.

More details can be found on the [Plugin-How-To wiki page](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/Plugin-How-To).

Fix pointer overflow in STRING\_CAT

```
The end pointer is positioned one past the end of the destination, and
it is undefined behavior to compute an address beyond the end pointer,
including for comparisons, even temporarily. The UB occurs exactly when
buffer overflow would have occurred, so the buffer overflow check could
be optimized away by compilers. Even if this wasn't the case, the check
could produce a false negative if the computed address overflowed the
address space, which is, after all, why the C standard doesn't define
behavior in the first place.

The fix is simple: Check using sizes, not addresses. The explicit cast
suppresses warnings about signed-unsigned comparisons, and the assertion
checks the cast.
