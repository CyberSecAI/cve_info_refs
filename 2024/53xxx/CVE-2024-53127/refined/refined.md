Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flawed fix in the mmc driver, specifically in the dw_mmc component. Commit `8396c793ffdf` ("mmc: dw_mmc: Fix IDMAC operation with pages bigger than 4K") incorrectly increased the `max_req_size`, even when using the standard 4K pages, leading to various issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Calculation of max_req_size:** The primary issue is the flawed calculation of the `max_req_size` within the `dw_mci_init_slot` function when the IDMAC transfer mode is used. The original fix increased this size by multiplying descriptor data length by ring size. This change was intended for handling page sizes larger than 4K but caused problems even for 4K page configurations. The `max_seg_size` was incorrectly set to equal the `max_req_size`.
- **Memory Corruption/OOM**: The increased `max_req_size`, even with 4K pages, triggered a number of issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The incorrect calculation led to several detrimental effects:
- **Kernel Panics:** Systems would panic during the boot process when attempting to load the kernel or root filesystem from an SD card. This was observed on Rockchip RK3566 and StarFive JH7100 platforms.
- **"swiotlb buffer is full" errors and Data Corruption**: On StarFive JH7110 platforms, the increased `max_req_size` caused errors related to the `swiotlb` buffer becoming full. This eventually lead to data corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the mmc driver is used with the IDMAC transfer mode and attempts to perform data transfers using an SD card.
- The vulnerability is triggered by reading/writing to an SD card using the dw_mmc driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger SD card data transfer.
-  No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability other than having an SD card. The vulnerability is triggered in the normal course of SD card operations on affected platforms.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content is a series of revert commits, which indicates that the identified fix was broken and was therefore rolled back. These revert commits highlight that the root cause is within commit `8396c793ffdf`
- The fix was deemed too problematic and was reverted instead of fixed due to the severity of the issues.
- The revert patch sets the `max_seg_size` to a fixed 0x1000 (4096 bytes), ensuring it doesn't exceed the standard page size, and recalculates `max_req_size` based on the corrected `max_seg_size`.
- The original fix was to address systems using page sizes larger than 4K, but the change affected even systems using 4K page sizes.
