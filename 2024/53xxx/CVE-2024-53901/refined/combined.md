Imager release history.  Older releases can be found in Changes.old

Imager 1.025 - 16 Nov 2024
============

 - trim: fix a buffer overflow due to a mis-sized buffer
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/534

 - JPEG: fix an invalid sscanf() return value check detected by CodeQL

 - FT2: separately #include t1tables.h, since ftmm.h no longer
   includes it from freetype 2.13.3
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/pull/533
   https://bugs.debian.org/1081821

Imager 1.024 - 6 Apr 2024
============

 - TIFF: improve reporting from a test on failure.

 - TIFF: support back to libtiff 4.0.8, for compatibility with RHEL
   and its clones.
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/527

Imager 1.023 - 13 Jan 2024
============

 - TIFF: don't read after free when looking up a compression codec
   by the libtiff defined name,
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/524

Imager 1.022 - 3 Dec 2023
============

 - TIFF: We can no longer be lazy in implementing the size callback.
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/522
   https://bugs.debian.org/1057270

Imager 1.021 - 1 Dec 2023
============

Several TIFF changes:

 - require libtiff 4.1.0 or later

 - add buildversion, builddate and libversion methods

 - add the codecs method which fetches a list of available TIFF
   compression codes

 - avoid deprecation warnings from libtiff about using the old
   libtiff defined integer types

 - require vsnprintf() (C99)

 - remove my adaption of TIFFReadRGBATile() since libtiff now provides
   TIFFReadRGBATileExt() which can do the same thing

 - use pkg-config to find libtiff if possible

 - for sufficiently modern libtiff (4.5.0) use TIFFClientOptions to
   specify the warning and error handlers, this means we no longer
   need a mutex for 4.5.0 and later.

 - collect warnings using a buffer chain instead of custom allocation
   code.

 - include the "module" name (typically a libtiff function name) when
   recording libtiff warnings.

 - add CI to test Imager::File::TIFF against libtiff 4.1.0 through 4.6.0

 - other minor fixes

Other changes:

 - prevent CodeQL from complaining about an implicit conversion to
   unsigned char

Imager 1.020 - 12 Nov 2023
============

 - masked(): disallow negative width/height masked images

 - masked(): adjust source corners as bottom right relative if they
   are negative.

 - masked(): reject image source corners where either co-ordinate is
   negative after the above adjustment.

 - Imager::Files: update external image file support modules list

 - internal test: don't fail on Imager::File::APNG link

 - disable Imager::Font::T1 and Freetype 1.x fonts by default.
   Unpatched t1lib simply doesn't work on 64 bit systems, and no-one
   ships the patched version anymore.
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/510

Imager 1.019 - 9 Jul 2022
============

 - fix palette/transparency table generation when writing paletted PNG
   images with tranparency.  This happened to work for the test case,
   but the mechanism used to generate the palette order preserved most
   palette index positions, which hid the problem with actually
   generating the PLTE and tRNS chunks.
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/499

 - added lowish-level read() and write() class methods to
   Imager::File::PNG, these are mostly intended for
   Imager::File::APNG, but are documented and usable elsewhere.

 - document in Imager::Install how to install Imager without any of
   the bundled-but-also-on-CPAN modules being installed.
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/498

Imager 1.018 - 19 Jun 2022
============

 - skip trying to produce deprecation warnings before perl 5.14, since
   that doesn't support custom warning categories within a package.
   This prevents pointless failures on these old versions of perl.

Imager 1.017 - 14 Jun 2022
============

Bug fix:

 - fix a one bytes underallocation for Imager::TrimColorList.  On
   older perls this could lead to writing a zero byte one past the end
   of the allocated block.

Documentation:

 - expand on why you might want to call Imager->preload() and that you
   probably don't need to.

Imager 1.016 - 12 Jun 2022
============

Upcoming backward incompatible changes:

 - deprecate setting/deleting tags by code.  If this causes you a
   problem please open an issue.  You can disable the warning produced
   with:

    no warnings 'Imager::tagcodes';

 - deprecate image channel masks.  If this causes you a problem please
   open an issue.  You can disable the warning produced with:

    no warnings 'Imager::channelmask';

If you use either of these features please let me know.

Minor features:

 - add magic/extension support for AVIF files, see Imager::File::AVIF
   on CPAN.

 - treat an unknown extension of two or more characters as a potential
   file type on write.

Bug fixes:

 - prevent a possible undefined value warning from t/t10jpeg.t

 - update MANIFEST.SKIPs, update MANIFESTs and improve MANIFEST testing.

 - TGA: failing to read in the palette of a paletted TGA file would
   leak memory.

 - JPEG: supplying invalid values for the new JPEG write tags could
   leak memory.

 - PNG: fix validation of Latin1 only tags when writing PNGs.
   (detected by clang)

 - matrix_transform: correctly use fabs() instead of abs() on floating
   point values when deciding whether to divide for a perspective
   transform. (detected by clang)

 - fix the i_poly_aa_cfill_m() API macro

Cage cleaning:

 - eliminate IO::File usage from the Imager code base

 - fix a type error harmlessly ignored by gcc but found by clang

 - eliminate memory leaks in sub-module Makefile.PL probe test code to
   allow the probes to succeed under LeakSanitizer.

 - BMP: fix some otherwise harmless clang warnings

 - remove some code meant to work around some unspecified old Solaris
   linker bug.

 - i_noise: prevent a harmless conversion warning from clang

 - fountain fill/filter: limit ssample_param to 1000 to simplify code.

Imager 1.015 - 7 May 2022
============

 - rename the "virtual" member of i_img to "isvirtual" to allow the
   API to be used from C++, this may break source compatibility, using
   the i_img_virtual() accessor is backward compatible.

 - add cookbook entry to populating an image from raw RGB samples
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/471

 - Imager::Probe now puts the existing value of PKG_CONFIG_PATH at the
   front of the PKG_CONFIG_PATH used when it calls pkg-config.

 - setup CodeQL workflow and fix detected warnings

JPEG updates:

 - detect libjpeg (of whichever variety) via pkg-config if possible

 - add specific support for mozjpeg (turn its optimization off by
   default so tests pass.)

 - add libjpeg_version(), is_mozjpeg(), is_turbojpeg() and
   has_arith_coding() methods

 - add jpeg_compress_profile output tag, which only matters for
   mozjpeg

 - the libjpeg_version() method replaces the old
   Imager::File::JPEG::i_libjpeg_version() function, and the format
   has changed.

 - various obscure jpeg output controls:

   - add support for JPEG arithmetic coding when the supplied libjpeg
     supports it.  Note that not all JPEG decoders can handle arithmetic
     coded JPEGs.

   - add support for disabling the JFIF header for JPEG files using the
     jpeg_jfif tag.

   - add support for smoothing to eliminate dithering noise (like cjpeg
     -smooth) using the jpeg_smooth tag.

   - add support for producing JPEG restart markers (like cjpeg -restart
     N), using the jpeg_restart tag.

   - add control over subsample for JPEG (like the cjpeg -sample
     parameter) using the jpeg_sample tag

   - added tags for the rest of the MozJPEG API parameters.

   - add jpeg_tune tag, corresponding to the MozJPEG cjpeg -tune-*
     options.

Imager 1.014 - 28 Apr 2022
============

Bug fixes:

 - fix failed to build on non-threaded perls.
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/472

 - when writing a paletted image with an alpha channel to PNG only
   set the tRNS chunk if the image has transparent colours.  With
   older libpng this could add an erroneous tRNS chunk (or possibly
   undefined behaviour if I understand the libpng code).
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/459

Features:

 - Imager::Color and Imager::Color::Float objects can now be created
   from CSS style rgb(...) strings.
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/463

 - added the as_css_rgb() method to both Imager::Color and
   Imager::Color::Float to format the supplied color as a CSS style
   rgb() string.
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/463

 - Imager::Color and Imager::Color::Float objects can now be created
   (copied) or set from other Imager::Color or Imager::Color::Float
   objects.

Imager 1.013 - 27 Apr 2022
============

 - added rgb_difference() method
   Thanks to Andreas König
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/pull/462

 - update ppport.h to prevent a redefinition diagnostic

 - update bug tracker URLs to point at github
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/pull/466

 - update some other bug tracker URLs too.

 - add the trim() and trim_rect() methods, to trim borders off an
   image.

 - add the as_float() method to Imager::Color and the as_8bit() method
   to Imager::Color::Float to convert between the two types.

 - update ppport.h to avoid a diagnostic in more modern perls.

 - add detection for HEIF, JPEG XL and QOI image formats

Imager 1.012 - 14 Jun 2020
============

 - Imager has moved to github.

 - T1lib support is deprecated

 - added guassian2 filter which allows separate filter radii for vertical
   and horizontal.  Thanks to Leolo.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=129769

 - freetype2 support can now use pkg-config to configure itself.

 - added red, green, blue, alpha methods to color objects.

 - eliminate use vars.

Imager 1.011 - 7 Mar 2019
============

General changes:

 - correct the type of the data parameter for im_decode_exif().

 - fix the release date listed below for 1.010

 - add missing change entry for RT #128142

 - binmode the correct handle in t/200-file/010-iolayer.t, this may fix some test
   failures on one CPAN smoker.

 - add the mymeta check (AUTHOR testing only) to MANIFEST

More Coverity fixes:

 - translate_errdiff() could leak memory on failure (introduced in
   1.009) CID 185565.

 - i_img_make_palette() could leak memory on failure (introduced in
   1.009) CID 185566.

 - DSO_open(), from the original dynamic loading API, could leak
   dlopen() handles on failure.  CID 185309.  DSO_close() now releases
   the memory associated with the internal DSO handle, rather than
   only releasing the dlopen() handle.

Imager 1.010 - 13 Feb 2019
============

General changes:

 - added the add_file_magic() class method for adding magic for new
   file types to Imager's fairly primitive file magic detection.

 - fixed an embarassing documentation typo in Imager::Test.

 - trying to read from a GIF file with no images now sets an error
   message.  Thanks to Peter Sergeant for reporting this.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=128481

 - use undeprecated encoding symbols for FT2.  This should fix the
   build on the badly patched CentOS 7 Freetype 2.  Thanks to Slaven
   Rezic for the report.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=128142

Coverity has come back up read-only, a few more changes:

 - add missing va_end() for bmp.c's write_packed().  CID 185320.

 - similarly for read_packed().  CID 185329.

 - add a NOTREACHED lint comment for pixel_coverage().  Compilers
   complained about a missing return, Coverity complains about the
   return.  CID 185325.

 - avoid a possible sign extension in imsgi.c. CID 185326.

 - add some FALLTHROUGH lint comments to i_readtga_wiol() where we
   deliberately fall through switch cases.  CID 185328.

 - add assertions in callers to i_new_hatch_low() since Coverity
   complained about some possible inconsistent NULL checks.  CID
   185339.  I ended up rearranging this function later.

 - remove pointless NULL checks from i_flipxy() and i_img_destroy().

Imager 1.009 - 11 Jan 2019
============

Critical issue:

 - drawing a filled, anti-aliased circle to the left or right of the
   image (not within the image at all) would cause a buffer overflow.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=128208

General changes:

 - to_paletted() and make_palette() now fail (with an error in
   errstr()) if invalid quantization parameters are supplied.

 - map() would corrupt a channel if there was a gap in the arrayref of
   channels.  Detected by Coverity.  CID 185300.

 - most numeric parameters to the XS implementation now throw an
   exception if supplied an unoverloaded reference.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=128208

Coverity finally finished a build[1], fixed several of the problems
found.  Coverity went down before I could finish working through them.

High severity:

 - reading a color-mapped TGA file with an id string would cause a
   double-free if the palette was truncated. CID 185317.

 - mixing scaling to sizes where the accumulator row, the working
   output row or the working input row didn't fit into the address
   space could result in memory leaks.  This can probably only be
   reproduced on very wide floating-point sample images. CID 185318.

 - convert an array style function parameter pointer to pointer style
   to prevent confusing Coverity in the T1 bounding box implementation.
   CID 185343.

 - Similarly in the FT1 bounding box implementation. CID 185338.

 - Similarly for the i_tt_rasterize() function in the FT1
   implementation.  CID 185303.

 - initialize a pointer to prevent Coverity complaining in polygon
   drawing (it should always end up being set.) CID 185341.

 - addi style makemap could potentially read one past the end of an
   array. CID 185337.

 - supplying a numeric hatch of 32 to Imager::Fill->new(hatch => ...)
   would result in read beyond the end of the built-in hatch array.
   Negative values (which Coverity didn't complain about) could also
   cause problems.  CID 185331.

 - the Imager::Color set_internal() interal method no longer
   calls the over-complicated ICL_set_internal() (which is retained
   only for the old API.)  Coverity complained that this leaked, but
   this could only occur with an invalid (NULL pointer) color object.
   CID 185323.

 - the underlying implementation of the map() method could read before
   the beginning on an allocated array if supplied with inconsistent
   parameters, which Coverity complained about.  No Imager code calls
   that function with inconsistent parameters, but a
   belt-and-suspenders check was added. CID 185315.

 - Coverity complained a call to i_getcolors(), used by the
   implementation of the is_bilevel() method could leave the fetched
   colors uninitialized.  Added a return value check. CID 185308.

 - a numeric combining mode of 13 (eg. as a parameter to
   Imager::Fill->new())could cause an invalid array read in
   i_get_combine() due to a fencepost error in validating the combine
   number.  CID 185299.

Lower severity (according to Coverity):

 - avoid an unneeded EXTEND() call when the FT1 has_chars()
   implementation returns 0. CID 185350.

 - avoid accessing a possibly NULL map from MakeMapObject() in a
   logging call. (GIF) CID 185296.

 - gradgen() allocated the wrong amount of space (always too much) for
   the color array.  CID 185291.

 - avoid dead code in i_tt_glyph_names(). CID 185321.

 - avoid dead code in i_get_anonymous_color_histo(), which is the
   implementation of getcolorusage().  CID 185327.

 - avoid dead code in i_ft2_glyph_name(), which is the implementation
   of glyph_names() for FT2.  CID 185342.

 - avoid dead code in i_t1_glyph_names(), which is the implementation
   of glyph_names() for T1.  CID 185322.

 - avoid an unneeded EXTEND() call when the FT2 has_chars()
   implementation returns 0. CID 185292.

 - the unpack code for ICO/CUR file handling could extend 32-bit
   unsigned values to 64-bit signed.  I believe this is harmless. CID
   185319.

 - remove an unneeded check when terminating the stream for JPEG
   writing.  CID 185347.

 - skip an unneeded check when freeing the combine temp buffer in the
   fountain filter.  CID 185286.

 - check the combine function pointer consistently rather than the
   combine code in one place in the fountain filter.

 - error diffusion now validates a custom error diffusion map and reports
   an error if it's bad.  CID 185288.

 - avoid discarding the value of i_io_getc() when scanning numbers in
   pnm.c.  CID 185293.

 - handle failure to clone the log filehandle when cloning the Imager
   context object on thread creation.  CID 185294.

 - fix an unsigned comparison when converting character code to a
   glyph index with a NULL character map when calculating the glyph
   for display for FT1.  This should be rare.  CID 185297.

 - fix a similar bug when calculating whether a glyph is present for
   has_chars() for FT1.  CID 185302.

 - i_img_info() (C API) no longer tries to handle a NULL image object
   pointer.  CID 185298.

 - re-work testing for size_t overflow for circle/random
   super-sampling for fountain fills.  CID 185304.

 - don't check if the unsigned size passed to Imager's malloc wrapper
   (mymalloc) is negative.  Left from when that parameter was signed.
   CID 185305.

 - make some types larger and add a cast to prevent integer overflows
   when calculating a palette with median cut for extraordinarily
   large images.  CID 185306.

 - don't check if the unsigned size supplied to
   im_set_image_file_limits() is negative.  CID 185307.

[1] The first two build submissions ended up at the end of a ~400 item
build queue, and seemed to have been cancelled by Coverity.  A build
submitted on NYE went through in minutes.

Imager 1.008 - 31 Dec 2018
============

 - moved EXIF handling from Imager::File::JPEG to core Imager
   This allows file formats that store EXIF data as blobs similarly
   to JPEG to re-use this code. (such as Imager::File::WEBP)

 - added some more file extensions to image file type mappings

 - added add_type_extensions() class method

 - Imager::Files now links to Imager::Install when discussing
   appropriate libraries.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127575

Imager 1.007 - 24 Nov 2018
============

 - add png_compression_level tag for writing PNG files.

 - avoid flooring a second time in matrix transform interpolation.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124001

 - produce v2 metadata.
   Includes change from the ticket and updates to sub-modules.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127216

 - improve error reporting for the polygon() method

Imager 1.006 - 26 Aug 2017
============

 - the internal i_errors() function now correctly allocates the stack
   space needed for its result.
   https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=131938

 - t/100-base/020-color.t now uses Imager::Test's test functions
   instead of its own.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=111993

 - write_multi() now returns an error result (a false value) if called
   with a non-(Imager image object).  Previously it would typically
   crash.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=117878

 - improve the documentation of the jpegquality parameter when
   writing JPEG files.

 - add code to mitigate CVE-2016-1238, Imager will no longer search the
   default current directory entry in @INC when searching for file
   format support modules.

Imager 1.005 - 16 Apr 2016
============

It's now been ten years since I switched to the new Changes file in
release 0.55.

 - revert the ivdformat probes, they don't work as is and trying to
   fix them is too much work for now.

Imager 1.004_004 - 15 Apr 2016
================

 - test that the ivdformat from Config is correct and look for a valid
   one if it isn't.
   For the strange Win32 failures.

 - fix a copy and paste error in pod in samples/samp-form.cgi

Imager 1.004_003 - 23 Mar 2016
================

 - add some extra error reporting to the I/O layers tests, this might
   help catch a failure seen on Win32.
   http://cpantesters.org/cpan/report/99781689-6bf5-1014-897a-75cb4eee1325

Imager 1.004_002 - 20 Mar 2016
================

 - don't use the seek() method on opened() handles in
   t/200-file/400-basic.t.  In older versions of perl such handles are
   only IO::Handle objects, not IO::File, and don't have a seek()
   method.

Imager 1.004_001 - 16 Mar 2016 (Birthday release - but not my birthday)
================

 - re-work the t/200-file/400-basic.t to correctly handle failures
   It's custom ok() function didn't have a prototype and didn't use scalar().
   This caused ok() to use the note instead of the value being tested when
   the method called returned an empty list.  For an example of the problem
   caused see: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=812093

 - remove some noise from when Imager tried to work with bugs in old
   versions of giflib.  I can't do much about the new bugs.

 - the new autolevels filter (Imager 0.99) used an integer for the
   sample scaling factor which caused the top output level to be too
   low (depending on the scaling required.)  It now uses a double.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=111871

 - the new autolevels filter had off-by-one errors calculating the
   minimum and maximum luminance from the histogram.  This slightly
   reduced the contrast of the output image.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=111871

 - the new autolevels filter now uses a lookup table for 8-bit images
   to avoid a floating point multiply for each sample.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=111871

 - fixed several memory leaks detected by valgrind:

   - addcolors() leaked the temporary array of colors supplied to the
     internal API

   - make_palette() leaked the temporary image array (not the images
     themselves) passed to the internal API.

   - combine()/i_combine() leaked its working row buffers

   - getcolorusage()/i_get_anonymous_color_histo() leaked the sample
     buffer if there were too many colors

   - getcolorcount()/i_count_colors() leaked the sample buffer if
     there were too many colors.

   - the nearest_color filter (undocumented until I find a use for it)
     leaked both temporaries passed to the API and internal buffers

   - the internal process of upgrading a paletted image to a direct
     color image would leak a context object reference count.

   - a write failure when writing to a GIF file could leak memory.

   - failing to write to a 1-bit/pixel ICO image could leak memory.

 - Imager no longer deliberately leaks the context object from the
   initial thread.  This was done to ensure there was always a context
   object available, but the code that needed that now handles the
   lack correctly,

 - fixed some uninitialized memory usage detected by valgrind:

   - rotate()/i_rotate_exact()/i_rotate_exact_bg()/i_matrix_transform()/
     i_matrix_transform_bg() didn't initialize a working color value
     if there was zero pixel coverage.

   - i_ft2_cp() didn't initialize the complete color when producing an
     intermediate image.  This caused uninitialized value usage when
     logging the color.

Imager 1.004 - 8 Nov 2015
============

 - Imager::Color::Table is now pre-loaded by the preload() method.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=104896

 - fix an assertion triggered under perl 5.23.4.
   Thanks to A. Sinan Unur for the report and the patch.

 - Imager->new can now be used to read raw image files.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=106836
   Thanks to Richard Kelsch for reporting this.

 - deal with output changes from Pod::Spell
   https://github.com/perl-pod/Pod-Spell/issues/21

Imager 1.003 - 12 May 2015
============

 - update 1.002 release notes to include the center change for filled
   circle drawing.

 - flood_fill() would escape beyond a 4-connected space under some
   circumstances.
   Added many more flood_fill() tests.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=103786

Imager 1.002 - 3 Apr 2015
============

 - drawing anti-aliased filled circles is now 10 to 50 times faster
   depending on the size of the circle.
   This also changed the center from being the center of the pixel to
   being the top left of the pixel to match the filled arcs drawn by
   arc().
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=101682

 - enhancements to polygon filling:

   - added a mode parameter to control how overlapping regions behave

   - added a polypolygon() method to fill more than one polygon at a
     time

   - polygon filling is now exposed through the API.

 - added colormodel(), alphachannel() and colorchannels() methods.
   These were added for two reasons:

    - a future version of Imager may allow the number of channels in
      an image to not directly represent the color model of an image.
      eg. a greyscale TIFF image with multiple alpha channels.

    - a future version of Imager may allow an image to be read without
      translation, for example a TIFF file that contains measurements
      from an instrument.  Currently Imager transforms the samples into
      the range 0.0 ... 1.0 which may means the user has to translate
      the value back.

      An untranslated image would be unusable as image data, so
      colormodel() would return "unknown" in this case.

      Similarly a CMYK image might be returned as an "unknown" color
      model image, if the caller chooses to disable translation to
      RGB.

Imager 1.001 - 2 Jan 2015
============

 - both Imager and perl 5.21.3 define my_strerror(), prevent a conflict
   Thanks to Slaven Rezic for the report and the patch.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=98234

 - GIF: clean-up a test file if the test for the giflib 4.2.0 file
   version bug fails.

 - fix Imager::Matrix2d::rotate()'s centre point handling
   https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=99959

 - ICO: don't apply the icon mask to images with an alpha channel by
   default
   https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=99507

 - make verbose probing output more verbose

 - use Imager::Probe to probe for freetype 1.x
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=100502

 - The --enable and --disable parameters to the top-level Makefile.PL
   work again.

 - update the bundled/modified Devel::CheckLib to handle the gcc-4
   symlink on Cygwin

Imager 1.000 - 28 Jul 2014
============

There's nothing special about Imager 1.000, it's just another release.

 - fix the skip check for the iolayer qr// buffer test

 - improve error reporting for the iolayer test failing on a small
   number of Win32 CPAN testers

Imager 0.99_02 - 21 Jul 2014
==============

 - Imager::Filter::Mandelbrot (and dynfilt/mandelbrot.c) - initialize
   the blue channel in the generated palette, and allow each color
   component to be in the range 100..255 instead of just 100..254.
   Thanks to Ralf Neubauer.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=97086

 - revert "improved the XS for i_io_read() and i_io_raw_read()"
   This caused problems with older perls and didn't provide much of a
   performance improvement.

 - support Inline 0.57 and later.
   Inline 0.57 changed the "with" interface.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=97108

 - don't define our own MAXINT macro, it conflicts with windows header
   files and in a few places it was the wrong value to use anyway.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=96425

Imager 0.99_01 - 29 Jun 2014
==============

 - GIF: add support for giflib 5.1.0, which added error code pointer
   parameters to EGifCloseFile() and DGifCloseFile().
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=96756

 - GIF: avoid a double-free when do_write() fails.

 - fix SV type probing to work on perl before 5.12.  Broken in 0.99.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=96761

 - PNG: skip the benign error test before libpng 1.6.0, since the
   error we're testing didn't exist before 1.6.0.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=94717 (continued)

Imager 0.99 - 25 Jun 2014
===========

 - Imager::IO->new_buffer() (and hence Imager->read()'s data
   parameter) now accepts a reference to a scalar as well as just a
   plain scalar.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=92785

 - Imager::IO->new_buffer() now always makes a copy of the passed in
   buffer to avoid problems with temporary objects used for the return
   value of SvPVbyte().
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=92785

 - improved the XS for i_io_read() and i_io_raw_read()
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=92738

 - load plugins from absolute paths on Android
   Thanks to Brian Fraser.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=93272

 - added the jpeg_optimize parameter for writing JPEG files.  This can
   significantly reduce file sizes, but uses more memory and time.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=94292

 - the autolevels filter now works on the luminance of the image
   rather then working per channel.  The old autolevels filter is
   still available as "autolevels_skew".
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=94413

 - Imager::File::PNG now supports libpng 1.6.10.
   1.6.10 changed CRC errors from benign errors to normal errors,
   which broke the test which used CRC errors to check for benign
   error support.  Switched to using a 1-bit grey-scale image with a
   palette to test for benign errors.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=94717

Imager 0.98 - 3 Jan 2014
===========

Incompatible changes:

 - the return value of setpixel() has changed.

   Previously the return values for undrawable pixels vs caller errors
   changed depending on whether you used the multiple pixel calling
   mechanism, or the single pixel mechanism.

   Now:

    - for an invalid parameter, such as an unknown colour, or missing
      parameter, an empty list (or undef in scalar context) is
      returned, and errstr() is set,

    - otherwise the number of pixels drawn is returned.  If none of
      the pixels could be drawn (they were all outside the image), "0
      but true" is returned.

   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=87650

Other changes:

 - when drawing on an image with an alpha channel where the source
   minimum is greater than zero, Imager would read from beyond the end
   of a malloc() allocated buffer.  In rare circumstances this could
   lead to some of the source image not being written to the target
   image, or possibly to a segmentation fault.
   I don't believe this has any security concerns beyond that.

 - if the first text drawn with Imager::Font::T1 is not anti-aliased,
   text drawn would be nonsense.  This would also read beyond the end
   of a malloced buffer.

 - non-AA text drawn with an Imager::Font::TT (Truetype 1) font would be
   truncated early.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=88993

 - Imager::Font::Wrap no longer requires the image parameter.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=87338

 - a documentation typo fix in Imager::Transformations
   Thanks to Adrian Yee.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=88598

 - Image::Probe, Imager's internal module for probing library
   locations now searches the directories specified by LD_RUN_PATH,
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH for libraries,
   and the corresponing s/\blib$/include/ directories for header
   files.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=86428

Imager 0.97 - 15 Jul 2013
===========

No changes from 0.96_02.

Imager 0.96_02 - 8 Jul 2013
==============

 - PNG: treat a version mismatch between headers and library as a
   probe failure.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=86659

 - PNG: the check for benign error support is more complex than a
   simple library version check, check for the appropriate macro.
   Thanks for Slaven Rezic for following up on my CPAN Testers result
   queries.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=86659

 - W32: add a missing head1 AUTHORS to the old Win32.pm
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=86658

Imager 0.96_01 - 1 Jul 2013
==============

 - TIFF: handle SampleFormat = 2 by translating the signed integer
   values to unsigned by flipping their sign bits.

   Handle SampleFormat = 3 where possible.

   SampleFormat is ignored for paletted images.

   Mixed SampleFormat are handled incorrectly, since libtiff returns
   only the first SampleFormat value, and an image with both an alpha
   channel and SampleFormat = 2 for color channels probably has a
   different SampleFormat for the alpha channel.

   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=74540

 - XS clean up:
     https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69243

   - Imager::Color's rgba() method now returns its values as integers
     instead of floating point. (IV instead of NV).

   - The XS for i_map() and i_matrix_transform() now use the AV *
     typemap instead of rolling their own.

   - The XS for DSO_call() now uses the HV * typemap instead of
     rolling it's own.

   - The XS for i_poly_aa(), i_poly_aa_cfill(), i_transform() and
     i_gradgen() now use a new T_AVARRAY typemap that greatly
     simplifies the XS code.

   - many other minor XS changes

   - some XS code formatting

 - TT (Freetype 1.x) and FT2 (Freetype 2.x) non-antialiased rendering
   now renders in alpha-combining mode, to match antialiased output.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=73359

 - add sample code and cookbook notes for drawing a blurred drop-shadow.

 - add support for libpng 1.6, which changed the defaults for
   reporting some types of error.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85746

 - FT2: use gsamp/psamp() to transfer pixels from the work image to
   the output image instead of gpix/ppix.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=83478

 - eliminate various GCC warnings, mostly initialized but otherwise
   unused variables.

Imager 0.96 - 19 May 2013
===========

 - rearrange Imager's test files.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=84596

 - Imager::Probe::_gcc_lib_paths now forces C locale.
   A sufficiently recent gcc prints localized keys for the search
   paths, which avoids that localization.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=84963

 - fix a pod error detected by Pod::Simple 3.27 and laterm and skip
   pod tests unless AUTOMATED_TESTING or IMAGER_AUTHOR_TESTING is set
   and true.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85262
   reported by Andreas König

 - add a test for unclosed POD in C source, and fix the errors it
   found.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=74875

 - fix some spelling errors detected by the newer aspell in Debian
   Wheezy.

 - remove a trailing ' from lib/Imager/Font/Test.pm's POD
   thanks to gregor herrmann <gregoa@debian.org>
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85413

 - add a test for standard =head1 commands and fix the errors found

Imager 0.95 - 19 Apr 2013
===========

 - handle the SVf_UTF8 flag correctly on magic strings passed to
   Imager::IO's write() and raw_write() methods.
   This may misbehave in perl 5.6.x since the UTF8 flag may not be
   visible in the main SV after SvGETMAGIC().
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=83438

 - document that bounding_box() ignores the transformation matrix
   supplied to tranform() for fonts.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=84106

Imager 0.94_02 - 5 Apr 2013
==============

 - enable debug logging for the standard font tests

 - skip the overloaded UTF-8 text output checks on 5.6.x and earlier,
   due to a bug in that version of perl.

 - don't test for read() failing on a write-only handle in 5.8.x and
   earlier, this was fixed in change 862083f7e4 in perl.

 - report the version of Inline found during testing (an attempt to
   diagnose some intermittent failures.)

Imager 0.94_01 - 2 Mar 2013
==============

 - NOTE: possibly backward incompatible:
   support reading from/writing to perl filehandes that aren't raw
   files.

   This allows Imager's I/O to honour handles with layers such as
   gzip, scalar file handles or tied file handles.

   This is backward incompatible in that previous Imager would simply
   use fileno() to retrieve the fd for the file and call write(2) etc
   on it directly.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=78843

 - moved most of README to lib/Imager/Install.pod which should make it
   more accessible to the "web" generation, also significantly updated
   and re-worked it.

 - updated README's for the separately distributed modules to refer to
   Imager::Install, and that they need -dev versions of packages
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=81265

 - the JPEG test code now reports the compile-time library version

 - avoid a possible compiler optimization issue on CentOS 5.9 i386 by
   rearranging (and mildly optimizing) some code.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=83212

 - fix a POD error in Imager::Fill (detected on new Pod-Simple)
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=83434

 - fix a broken link to Graphics::Magick
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=82743

 - drawing text to a channel with FT2 would draw with random coverage
   due to an uninitialized alpha channel.

 - marked the function pointer underlying the mm_log() API with the
   correct gcc magic and fixed the resulting warnings.

 - fixed some other compiler warnings

 - Imager::Font::W32 now properly reports text drawing errors
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=70098

 - handle the SVf_UTF8 flag correctly on magic (eg. overloaded)
   strings passed as text to draw(), bounding_box(), has_chars(),
   glyph_names() (where supported) in each of the font drivers.
   This may misbehave in perl 5.6.x since the UTF8 flag may not be
   visible in the main SV after SvGETMAGIC().
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=83438 (partial)

Imager 0.94 - 15 Dec 2012
=========================

Variations on some of these changes were included in development
releases.

 - improved thread safety
   - the internal error stack and log file handle are now in a per-thread
     context object
   - JPEG now captures IPTC information in a thread-safe way
   - avoid globals where possible for warning capture in libtiff
   - use a mutex to avoid re-entering thread-unsafe giflib
   - use a mutex to avoid re-entering thread-unsafe tifflib
   - use a mutex to avoid re-entering thread-unsafe T1Lib
   - use a library handle per thread for freetype 2.
   - use an engine handle per thread for freetype 1.x.
   - originally these changes broke ABI compatibility, this has been
     restored.

 - clarify the return value of getpixel();
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=81198

 - fixed a race condition in parallel testing for T1

 - fixed a bug in handling yoff for untransformed image-based fills

 - documentation improvements for Imager::Fill

 - FT2: report the library version while testing.

Imager 0.93 - 15 Oct 2012
===========

Bug fixes:

 - previously a transparency enabled GIF write (the default) would
   always use a GIF89a header even if none of the images were
   transparent.

 - previously the probe step for freetype-config would fail on cygwin

 - catch an invalid matrix parameter to convert() instead of crashing
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=79922

 - remove the 16-bit/sample limitation from the documentation for
   setsamples(), it hasn't applied for many releases.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=79989

 - don't copy setsamples() data parameter, it may be a large scalar
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=79990

 - clean up .dSYM directories generated performing probes on OS X
   Mountain Lion.

 - pass the --verbose command-line option through to Imager::Probe in
   sub-module's Makefile.PLs
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75878

Enhancements:

 - support for giflib 5.0. (5.0.1 and later)
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=79029
   The giflib API Imager uses doesn't have a mechanism to set the
   header version in 5.0.0.

 - update the GIF library probe code to check for the new giflib 5.0.1
   EGifSetGifVersion() function, and to check for the giflib 4.2.0
   uninitialized gif89 bug.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=79679
   http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3574283&group_id=102202&atid=631304

 - avoid static variables when capturing IPTC data from JPEG files

 - match Imager::Font::T1's error message translations to those from
   later versions of T1Lib.

 - for libtiff versions that support extended warning handlers (3.8.0
   or later), use them to avoid some global variables.

 - note Image::ExifTool for better metadata support.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=79251

Imager 0.92 - 14 Aug 2012
===========

 - giflib 4.2 eliminates the GIF_LIB_VERSION macro, handle that
   correctly for both probing and runtime.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=77672

 - allow building JPEG/imexif.c on C89 compilers.

 - allow building GIF/imgif.c on C89 compilers.

Imager 0.91 - 4 Jun 2012
===========

Bug fixes:

 - The size of rotated images is no longer rounded up so aggressively.
   Added rounding to the linear interpolation done for rotate() and
   matrix_transform() for 1 and 3 channel 8-bit images.
   Adjusted the two tranlate matrices used to build the final rotation
   matrix to use the distance between the outlier pixels rather than
   the pixel dimensions (ie. dimension-1).
   With all of this the output of rotate(degrees => 270) on an 8-bit
   image exactly matches the output of rotate(right => 270).
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=77063

Other changes:

 - eliminate the old IIM_new(), IIM_DESTROY() names from Imager's
   internals, those names only matter for the XS interface.

 - improve error reporting when PERL_INITIALIZE_IMAGER_CALLBACKS finds
   the API level compiled into a loadable module such as
   Imager::File::GIF doesn't match that of Imager.  Previously it
   could be difficult to determine exactly which module was failing to
   load.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=77173

 - added Imager->check_file_limits() as an interface to the
   i_int_check_image_file_limits() API.

 - Imager->set_file_limits(reset => 1) now resets the limits to the
   defaults rather than setting them all to unlimited.

 - wrote a brief security note as Imager::Security
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=68910

Imager 0.90 - 30 Apr 2012
===========

Bug fixes:

 - Imager::Test::is_imaged() attempted to process an "epsilon"
   parameter but the prototype didn't allow for the extra parameter.
   Corrected the prototype.

 - when downconverting samples (eg. from floating point to 8 bit)
   Imager now rounds the sample value rather than attempting to
   allocate input values over output values equally.  The old
   behaviour had the probably surprising effect of converting a
   floating point 2.1/255.0 into an 8-bit 3 rather than the expected
   2.
   This may result in slightly different 8 or 16-bit output images.

 - BI_BITFIELD BMP images were handled incorrectly, both in
   incorrectly calculating the space required for the masks and in
   processing the image data itself.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=76736

 - some odd width BMP BI_RLE4 images use run lengths that run one off
   the edge of the image.  Imager now allows this, discarding the
   extra column.

 - odd length RLE4 runs in BMP images were decoded incorrectly.

 - pkg-config could sometimes return a library that was in a directory
   EU::MM / $Config{libpth} doesn't know about, but the compiler did.
   If no -L is included in the pkg-config library information check if
   EU::MM can find the library, and if not, search our configured
   directories and insert that into the library flags.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75869

 - Imager::Probe can now probe for libraries with dependent libraries,
   common for static linking, eg. libpng requires libz.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=74043

 - libpng 1.5 specific probes were looking for libpng 1.4 filenames.

 - added alternative probe configurations that try to link libz, to
   handle a statically linked libpng.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=74043

 - if a probe includes testcode, Imager::Probe now checks that code as
   part of the process of checking each configuration rather than as a
   post test of the found configuration.  This allows alternate
   configurations to be checked if a matching but non-working
   configuration is found.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=74043

Other changes:

 - when reading or writing images via callbacks, the default callbacks
   now push an error message indicating that a required callback was
   called but not supplied.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=76782

 - clarify which callbacks are required for reading and writing TIFF
   images.

 - improve logging for creation of callback I/O layers.

 - a little more documentation for Imager::Probe.

 - the i_get_file_background() and i_get_file_backgroundf() APIs now
   return int to indicate whether the i_background tag was found.

 - PNG rework
   - improve error reporting
   - add png_interlace, png_bits tags
   - read paletted images as paletted images, including transparency
   - read 1 bit greyscale images as a type suitable for other file
     handlers to write as bilevel
   - read 16 bit/sample PNG as 16-bit/sample Imager images
   - write "bilevel" paletted images as 1 bit grayscale images
   - write paletted images as paletted images
   - write 16-bit (or higher)/sample images as 16-bit/sample PNG
     images
   - improved metadata support
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29268

Imager 0.89 - 18 Mar 2012
===========

Bug fixes:

 - getpixel(..., type => "float") and the API i_gpixf() have been
   broken on paletted images since they were implemented.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75258

Other changes:

 - links in the METHOD INDEX now point at the method documentation
   rather than the heading you can find them under.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71495

 - Imager (and the bundled dynamic modules) no longer fallback to
   using DynaLoader if loading via XSLoader fails.
   For the bundled modules this could hide useful error messages.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75560

 - IM_DEBUG_MALLOC mymalloc() no longer sn?printfs() a string to a
   buffer in the array of allocations, but just stores the filename
   pointer and line number.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=70388

Imager 0.88 - 22 Feb 2012
===========

 - describe how to build libgif etc on OS X in such a way as to be
   compatible with a fat binary perl (such as the system perl), in
   README.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=73371

 - update the change notes for 0.77_01 to indicate that libungif
   support was removed.

 - add some other imaging modules to SEE ALSO
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=73906

 - note that the generator of the apparently non-DFSG-free postscript
   in MMOne.pfb is a Debian package.

 - setsamples() is now a true complement to getsamples() - it can
   write 8-bit or floating point samples from a scalar or array
   reference.  This adds i_psamp() and i_psampf() to the C level API.

 - the XS interfaces to i_gsamp(), i_gsampf() and i_gsamp_bits() have
   changed to make better use of the typemap, but these aren't part of
   the perl level API anyway.  There were no changes to the C level
   interfaces to these functions.

 - getpixel() and setpixel() now accept a mix of scalar and array
   references for the x and y parameters, and unequal array lengths is
   no longer an error.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=73697

Bug fixes:

 - correctly calculate the size of a rotated image
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69261

 - fix incorrect rounding of color values for matrix_transform() and
   rotate().
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69261

 - Win32 text output is now done in normal combine mode, the alpha
   component of the color is now significant.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=70014

 - remove long unused gif case from read()
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69244 (partial)

 - the getsamples() target parameter was being treated as a hashref
   when it's meant to be an array reference.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=74882

 - getpixel() and setpixel() now returns an empty list when invalid
   parameters are supplied.
   Invalid values for type now result in an error for getpixel().
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=73697

Imager 0.87 - 03 Jan 2012
===========

 - document the return value of the filter() method.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=72369

 - document i_gsamp_bits() and i_psamp_bits().
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=68815

 - properly increment the Imager::Matrix2d $VERSION.

 - actually include the Imager::Test tests in the dist

 - correctly read and write 256x256 pixel ICO files
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69599

 - make the error message from read() or read_multi() when they can't
   identify the file type match reality.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=72475

 - read() now uses $FORMATGUESS if it can't determine the file type
   based on the file header, to match read_multi().

 - re-work and add tests for def_guess_type().  def_guess_type() no
   longer returns any random file extension as the file type.

 - add gray4, gray16 and gray as presets for make_colors.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=67911

 - add make_palette() method that produces a palette from one or more
   images.

 - fix the Imager dependency for the separately distributed font
   drivers.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=72643

 - fix i_render_color() to properly draw in "normal" mode - ie. when
   writing to a 1 or 3 channel image the second or fourth channel of
   the source color was being ignored, it is now significant.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71564

Imager 0.86 - 31 Oct 2011
===========

 - improve error reporting for W32 tests

Imager 0.85_02 - 24 Oct 2011
==============

Bug fixes:

 - eliminate unused i_gif_opts type (clean-up)
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69245

 - fix combine=0 fill color anti-aliasing on the double/sample path
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71309

 - make default text color non-transparent
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71469

 - apply the last of the Debian unforwarded spelling fixes
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=70656

 - the log() method used its message parameter as a C level format
   string.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71653

 - provide our own STRLEN typemap entry for older perls.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71641

 - add extra ppport.h configuration to support older perls.

 - depend on Scalar::Util, since we use it and older perls don't have
   it.

 - add overloaded eq to Imager::Matrix2d, since older perls don't seem
   to synthesize it from overloaded "".

  - use T1_StrError() for error messages on modern libt1
    https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69879

 - actually load the font rather than just adding it to the catalog on
   creation.

 - Imager::Font->new now produces better error messages for the T1
   engine.

 - the font has_chars() method now returns perl's true and false
   values in list context rather than integers, which should be more
   efficient.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69158

 - the btm data structure used by the flood_fill code is now
   initialized more efficiently.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=68994

 - updated the Thanks list in README
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71607

 - check there's at least one coefficient for the convolution filter
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=68993

 - make the APIRef synopsis ordering consistent, older versions of
   perl could order it differently.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71675

 - we rely on Config.pm's d_vsnprintf as to whether we use
   vsnprintf/snprintf, which is defined in the Win32 Config.pm even
   though it only has _ prefixed versions of these.  Define our own
   prefixed names on Win32.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71642

 - fix library detection with MSVC

 - search a few more library directories, so EU::MM doesn't discard
   them.  Hopefully fixes:
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=71643

Imager 0.85_01 - 10 Oct 2011
==============

 - add simple tests for the Imager::Test test_image generators

 - io_glue I/O buffering re-work:

   - reorganize io_glue to do it's own buffering by default

   - the unbuffered functions are available as i_io_raw_read() (or
     raw_read() from perl) etc but are not recommended for typical
     use.

   - use the new i_io_peekn() when checking for file magic to avoid
     seek, allowing Imager to detect the file type and read the file
     from an unseekable stream (for formats that don't use random
     access)

   - added several new I/O layer API functions.

   - fix the TGA performance problem, most noticably on Win32
     https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=70037

   - TIFF now uses wrapper functions of the correct types to avoid casts
     https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69912

   - the callback IO object did its own buffering, controlled by the
     maxbuffer parameter supplied to the read() and write() methods.
     This buffering has been removed, to avoid redundancy with the
     common io_glue buffering.  This also avoids a bug in that code
     which could rarely pass a zero length to the read callback and
     then panic about the result.

   - the callback IO object now tests the result of calling the close
     callback, which should return true for success.

   - the PNM reader did its own buffering.  This buffering has been
     removed to avoid redundancy with the common io_glue buffering.

   - previously the read handlers for fd and callback I/O layers would
     call the underlying interface (POSIX read or your supplied callback)
     until it filled the buffer.  It now only makes one call.

   - added public constructors for I/O layer objects (see Imager::IO)

   - all core file handlers now use the i_io_foo() wrappers to gain
     access to buffered I/O rather than calling the I/O layer
     callbacks directly.

   - all core file handlers now check for error on close.

   - Backward compatibility: if you hava custom file handlers, you can
     use i_io_write() etc since they're available as macros in older
     versions of Imager.

   - eliminate the final remnants of io_glue_commit_types().

   - bump IMAGER_API_VERSION, since the above may break assumptions.

 - removed the long unused i_gen_reader() and i_gen_writer() utility
   functions.

Imager 0.85 - 29 Aug 2011
===========

The main changes in the release versus 0.84 are:

 - on 64-bit systems, 64-bit types are consistently used for image
   dimensions and co-ordinated, and for memory block sizes.

 - handle IFD loops in TIFF files correctly.  Previously this would
   lead to an infinite loop.

Bug fixes:

 - fix the link in the getheight() entry in the method index

Imager 0.84_02 - 22 Aug 2011
==============

Development release, this will become 0.85 if CPAN testers is
favourable.

Bug fixes:

 - the image file limits set by set_file_limits() weren't being
   checked when reading TIFF files.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69915

 - Provide more information about file format module load errors on a
   failed image file read() or write().
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69194

 - use TIFFReadDirectory() instead of TIFFSetDirectory() to iterate
   through TIFF images, since it checks for IFD loops.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69914

 - don't leak memory when out of range palette indexes are supplied to
   setscanline().
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69242

 - require a later version of CPAN::Meta to ensure JSON::PP and
   CPAN::Meta::YAML are available.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69008

 - hoist the per-line calculations for the flines implementations, and
   modernize the tests a bit.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=70126

 - detect snprintf()/vsnprintf() (cheat by using Config.pm) and use
   them when available.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69147

 - if t1lib failed to reinitialize it would be left as marked
   initialized.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69877

 - update the bundled (and still modified) Devel::CheckLib
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69170

Imager 0.84_01 - 8 Aug 2011
==============

Development release as a sanity check for the types re-work.

Massive types re-work:

 - the type used internally for pixel co-ordinates and image sizes is
   now 64-bit on 64-bit platforms (at least sane ones).

 - size_t is now used consistently for memory block sizes.

 - since this changes the binary interface, the Imager API version has
   been incremented.  Any module that uses the API will need to be
   rebuilt.  In most cases that will be enough, but calls to any APIs
   that take a pointer to image sizes may need source changes.

 - you should be able to create very large images on 64-bit systems,
   if you have enough memory.  Successfully created a 32768 x 49192 x
   3 channel image, filled with a tiled image and scaled it.  The
   unscaled image was also successfully saved to a JPEG.

 - check the image size before attempting to write BMP, GIF, JPEG,
   PNG, SGI, TGA, TIFF images.

 - correctly handle reading TGA images over 32767 pixels wide or tall.

Incidental changes:

 - the gif_left and gif_top tags are now clamped to non-negative
   values when writing a GIF image.

 - removed dead callback read/write code

The default maximum memory size when reading files is now 1G.

Imager 0.84 - 20 Jun 2011
===========

 - Imager no longer inherits from Exporter (unless you're running an
   old, old perl.

 - Imager can now write progressive JPEGs (it could always read them).
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=68691

Bug fixes:

 - re-work, document and test Imager's logging facility.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65227

 - fix META.yml testing and the generated META.yml
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65235

 - test and add error reporting to to_*() family methods

 - add to_rgb_double() method.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65101

 - Imager no longer exports anything by default
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65228

 - convert colors to grayscale if the supplied (or generated) palette
   contains only grays when performing error diffusion color
   translation.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=68508

 - writing a paletted image to GIF wouldn't always use the colors
   supplied (or generated, eg. via make_colors => "mono"), which was
   confusing at best.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=67912

 - replace (imager|tony)@imager.perl.org in the doc, since I don't
   plan to continue receiving mail at that address.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=68591

Imager 0.83 - 21 May 2011
===========

Bug fixes:

 - diag() the error message on failure for some TIFF tests that are
   failing on a Solaris smoker.
   http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/6396db1e-8090-11e0-9682-112b785ebe45

Imager 0.82_01 - 17 May 2011
==============

Dev release, in case the compose tests are too sensitive.

Bug fixes:

 - Imager::Font::T1 incorrectly checked for absolute filename under
   Win32.  Thanks to kmx for the report and fix.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=67963

 - compose() with the target, source or mask position off the top or
   left of the target image didn't clip the source image correctly.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=67220

 - compose() now returns a useful error message on a non-positive
   opacity.

 - compose.im now at 100% test coverage. (As opposed to, umm, much,
   much less.)

Imager 0.82 - 14 Mar 2011
===========

Bug fixes:

 - eliminate calls to i_has_format() from the test suite, since it's
   no longer a useful way to check for file format support.  Eliminate
   i_has_format() from the functions exposed via XS.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65863

 - eliminate calls to note(), which isn't in the (very old) version of
   Test::More we have as a pre-requisite.  note() is modern enough
   that I don't feel a need to require a Test::More upgrade for it.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65864

 - skip the threads tests on Test::More 2.00_*
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65812

 - add an (unshipped) test to check Imager's internal POD links
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65749

 - improve the library detection summary
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=9675

 - increase the version of Imager::Font::Type1 so that upgrades don't
   downgrade the version in this file.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=66250

 - if we see an -rpath (or -R) option in $Config{lddlflags} supply
   that option for the directories that would normally go in
   LD_RUN_PATH.  Typically an explicit -rpath overrides LD_RUN_PATH.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65955

Imager 0.81 - 14 Feb 2011
===========

 - added coverage tests for masked images (maskimg.c @100% test coverage)

 - add hsv() method to Imager::Color
   Thanks to Leolo (Philip Gwyn)
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65385

 - split libt1 Type 1 font support into a sub-module
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=49616 (partial)

 - add a preload() class method for use in forking servers, and to
   work around limitations in PAR.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65665

Bug fixes:

 - paletted writes to a masked image are now masked correctly.
   Revealed by new coverage tests.

 - update the filter plugin documentation.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=56513

 - add the matrix() method to Imager::Matrix2d to allow creation of a
   matrix with specified co-efficients.  You can now multiple an
   Imager::Matrix2d object by a 9 element array ref or a number.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29938

 - really fix loading TTF fonts with FT2 when FT1 isn't available.
   Thanks to Leolo (Philip Gwyn)
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65386
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=62855

 - make sure each test script that needs testout/ creates it.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65088

 - handle a slightly different warning from libtiff 4.x
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65268

 - the sat transform2() op returned an incorrect saturation.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65391

Imager 0.80 - 17 Jan 2011
===========

 - added coverage tests for Imager::Fountain and Imager::Color::Float

 - Imager is now maintained in git
   http://git.imager.perl.org/imager.git
   git://git.imager.perl.org/imager.git

Bug fixes:

 - images with an translucent alpha channel were not scaled correctly
   by the default (qtype=normal) scaling method.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=63922

 - Imager::Color::Float now translates "#FFFFFF" to white instead of
   just a little darker.

 - make the default color map build algorithm "mediancut".  This
   changes the default color map builder for writing GIFs back to what
   it was in 0.77, reverting a performance regression.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=64785

 - handle failure to create a masked image correctly

Imager 0.79 - 10 Dec 2010
===========

 - add Imager::Test to the POD coverage tests and document the missing
   functions.

 - the convert() method now optimizes the case where all output
   channels are either 0, sourced from a single input channel or 1.
   This significantly speeds up presets like "addalpha", "green".
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=51254

 - add wiggle.pl sample, as suggested by Dan Oppenheim.

 - add the combine() method to combine channels from multiple source
   images into a new image
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=11872

Bug fixes:

 - treat the co-efficients for convert() as doubles instead of floats.

 - If a higher (earlier) priority font handler failed to load, that
   would crash preventing loading of later font handlers.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=62855

 - parse defines from the options returned by pkg-config --cflags
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=63223

 - a regen of the MANIFEST revealed that GIF and FT2 tests weren't
   included in the tarball.  They are now included.

Imager 0.78 - 4 Oct 2010
===========

Bug fixes:

 - don't access deprecated members of the png_structp.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60242

 - document that using color objects is faster than supplying colors
   by name, etc.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=61047

 - Imager::Probe now accepts array references for incpath and libpath.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60244

Imager 0.77_02 - 27 Sep 2010
==============

 - moved Win32, FreeType 2 font support into sub-modules.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=49616 (partial)
   Uses Imager::Probe now.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=61328

 - tested successfully with jpeg-8b
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60221

Bug fixes:

 - from _01: look for missing file support test files in the right
   places.

 - flood_fill() wouldn't fill the right side of a single scan-line
   fill area.
   Thanks to Nicolas Roggli for reporting this.

 - flood_fill wouldn't fill to the left edge of the image if the
   starting line didn't reach the left edge.
   Thanks to Nicolas Roggli for reporting this.

Imager 0.77_01 - 13 Sep 2010
==============

 - add each library-directory/pkgconfig/ to the pkg-config search path
   in Imager::Probe.
   Thanks to Justin Davis.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60491

 - moved GIF, TIFF, JPEG file handling code into sub-modules in
   preparation for separate distribution.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=49616 (partial)

   Note: this removed support for libungif from Imager.

 - optimize filled box drawing (color, not fill)

Bug fixes:

 - Imager::Probe was calling ExtUtils::Liblist to initialize
   LD_RUN_PATH supplying an undefined value rather than the found
   directory.  Thanks to Justin Davis.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60491

 - only prepend ./ to font filenames when passing them to T1Lib and
   then only when it would use its search mechanisms.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60509

 - fix the cache check for the X rgb.txt loader.  This is typically
   used for color translation on Unix-like systems, and the fix
   improves performance of supplying colors by name by about 80 times.
   Test code that managed 3400 10x10 pixel boxes/second sped up to
   25700 boxes/second.

 - clarify that Imager doesn't write EXIF metadata to images.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60637

 - Imager::Probe can now search subdirectories under its include path.
   Used by the PNG Makefile.PL to find headers and libraries when they
   aren't in the base directory, as in cygwin.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60635

Imager 0.77 - 11 Aug 2010
===========

I don't want Imager::File::PNG indexed as part of Imager, but forgot
to update the META.yml before updating the version.

 - don't index Imager::File::PNG as part of Imager

 - add resources to META.yml

Imager 0.76 - not released
===========

Bug fixes:

 - the align_string() method would ignore a string of "0" due to a
   mis-use of C< ||= >.
   Thanks to Maurice Height for reporting this.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60199

Imager 0.75_03 - 09 Aug 2010
==============

Bug fixes:

 - read_types() and write_types() would include png when it wasn't
   available due to a problem with the %formats tie

 - handle dependent libraries correctly (eg -lpng requiring -lz) in
   the code run phase of library probing.

Imager 0.75_02 - 07 Aug 2010
==============

Bug fixes:

 - add file missing from MANIFEST, which was causing TIFF failures.

Imager 0.75_01 - 06 Aug 2010
==============

Test release for the new PNG probe.

 - added the ability to read multiple-image PNM files.
   Note that unlike the pbm/pgm/ppm specification this accepts mixed
   format files and allows white space padding between files.
   Thanks to Philip Gwyn (Leolo) for this patch.

 - moved the PNG file handling code into a sub-module in preparation
   for separate distribution.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=49616 (partial)
   Also helps avoid complications from -I/-L compile/link options from
   other libraries.

Bugs:

 - Imager->new(data => $data) didn't try to process image file data in
   $data
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=58761

 - t/t50basicoo.t no longer depends on the other tests to generate its
   input files.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=9798
   Also, it wasn't testing pnm (pnm vs ppm mix-up)

 - update the documentation of hardinvert to match the change in 0.62.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=59785

 - added hardinvertall filter which also inverts the alpha channel
   (sorry for the mess)

 - when probing for TIFF, set LD_RUN_PATH just as the Makefile does so
   the probe can find the library for the test run.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=57518

Imager 0.75 - 20 Jun 2010
===========

 - use PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT to slightly improve performance on threaded
   perls (not measured)

Bugs:

 - an opacity fill based on a fountain fill would segfault when
   filling an 8-bit/sample image.

 - merge thickline branch polygon fix
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43518

Imager 0.74 - 7 May 2010
===========

Bug fixes:

 - read_multi() didn't handle a missing file format library correctly,
   aborting on failing to call i_readgif_multi_wiol() or
   i_readtiff_multi_wiol().

 - fix spelling errors patched by Debian
   http://svn.debian.org/viewsvn/pkg-perl/trunk/libimager-perl/debian/patches/spelling.patch?revision=54839&view=markup

 - add an (unshipped) author test to spellcheck Imager's POD.

 - update the TIFF file format documentation
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=56510

 - lib/Imager/IO.pod was written almost 4 years ago but never shipped.

Imager 0.73 - 15 Mar 2010
===========

 - implement outline circles, both anti-aliased and not
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19755

 - a combine => "none" fill to a 1 or 3 channel image would produce
   the incorrect colour.

Imager 0.72 - 09 Dec 2009
===========

Bump version for release, since 0.71_03 is stable with CPAN testers.

Imager 0.71_03 - 5 Dec 2009
==============

 - further adjust the threads test so it only performs the tests on
   perls where it's expected to work, and only if the threads module
   can be loaded.

Imager 0.71_02 - 1 Dec 2009
==============

 - adjust the way we load the threads module for the threads test so
   it works with non-threaded perls

Imager 0.71_01 - 30 Nov 2009
===========

Bug fixes:

 - use scanline oriented operations to flip images instead of pixel
   operations
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39278

 - use double/sample operations to flip large sample images instead of
   8-bit sample operations.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39280

 - fix POD nits
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=51874

 - prevent double-frees when someone creates Imager objects and then
   creates a thread.  Note: this just handles some simple cases,
   Imager doesn't support perl threads, and isn't likely to.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=52268

Imager 0.71 - 16 Nov 2009
===========

 - add the opacity fill type - an adaptor that modifies the opacity of
   another fill.

Bug fixes:

 - the conv filter now enforces that the sum of the coefficients is
   non-zero.  Also, rather than skipping pixels off the edge off the
   edge of the image, the closest edge pixel is used.  Previously
   dividing by the zero sum of coefficients could cause invalid
   results or runtime exceptions.
   Thanks to David Cantrell's Alpha-NetBSD CPAN test box for revealing
   this bug.

Imager 0.70 - 21 Sep 2009
===========

Bug fixes:

 - release image row and comments memory on all error returns in gif
   reader

 - handle zero length extensions, previously this would cause a null
   pointer dereference
   Thanks to Krzysztof Wojtaś for the test data and fix for this.

 - an integer division meant that preview scaling to below 1 pixel
   wide or high (which isn't too useful anyway) was calculating using
   NaNs on most platforms, and causing an exception on others.
   Thanks to David Cantrell for producing a backtrace of the crash on
   his Alpha-NetBSD CPAN test box which made it possible to track this
   down.

Imager 0.69 - 08 Sep 2009
===========

Bug fixes:

 - broken test fix - was attempting to call a function skip_all, when
   that should be a parameter to plan().

 - briefly document apidocs.perl, the tool used to build
   Imager::APIRef and make some minor enhancements

 - various minor documentation enhancements and fixes.

Imager 0.68 - 07 Sep 2009
===========

 - Imager->new(file => $filename) and other similar incantations will
   load the given file.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=48261

Bug fixes:

 - avoid using CHECK as a label in Imager::Test
   http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/5220921

 - re-work most image file test files that require a library into
   separate library present/not present files to remove stupidly long
   conditionals

 - don't treat rubthrough() outside the bounds of the target image as
   an error.
   http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/5185716

Imager 0.67_01 - 02 Sep 2009
==============

Bug fixes:

 - correct documentation of default of raw image interleave read
   parameter
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=42074

 - add raw_ prefix to raw read parameters, though the original names
   still work.

 - fail the read if an invalid raw_interleave parameter is supplied

 - warn if no interleave or raw_interleave parameter is supplied,
   since the documented default was wrong, and incompatible with the
   write format

 - for reading raw images, if raw_storechannels > raw_datachannels,
   set the extra channels in the image to 0

 - when probing for executables like freetype-config, search for .bat
   and .cmd on MSWin32, as well as .exe.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=49275

 - re-work the external libraries section of README:
   - list Debian and Redhat package names for each library
   - reformatting
   - update URLs

 - use the new EU::MM META_MERGE facility instead of generating
   META.yml from scratch
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=47888

 - use Devel::CheckLib (bundled, modified) to check which release of
   libtiff is installed and reject 3.9.0
   http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2088
   http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=543079

Imager 0.67 - 12 Dec 2008
===========

Bug fixes:

 - fix a packaging error

Imager 0.66 - 12 Dec 2008
===========

 - 24-bit color .ICO/.CUR files can now be read.

Bug fixes:

 - an optimization skipping 0 src alpha values could cause the
   rubthrough() to read past the end of a buffer.
   http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2008/05/msg1509184.html

 - corrected a reference leak where writing GIFs would leak memory.
   This could also happen calling to_paletted().
   Also documented the underlying long existing feature where the
   colors parameter is filled with the generated color table and added
   tests for it.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=41028

 - write out the image size in bytes field of a BMP correctly.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=41406

 - add limited tests for Imager::ExtUtils

 - make Imager::ExtUtils->includes use an absolute path, since
   a relative path could cause failures using Inline::C.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=37353

 - re-arrange the POD for Imager::Font::BBox:
   - mark total_width(), pos_width(), end_offset() obsolete, since
     they're mostly for backwards compatibility
   - group width methods and height methods
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39999

Imager 0.65 - 20 May 2008
===========

Bug fixes:

 - In some cases when an error occurs reading those parts of a JPEG
   file after the image the scan-line buffer could be freed a second
   time.  In cases where the the error occured while reading the image
   data it's possible that the buffer could have leaked.
   Thanks to Gabriel Vasseur for reporting this and help in tracking
   it down.

 - the gif_screen_height tag was overriding the screen width and being
   ignored for the screen height when present.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=35568

Imager 0.64 - 23 April 2008
===========

This is a bug fix release.  This includes a fix for a possible
security issue.

Bug fixes:

 - Possible security issue: The floating point sample path for image
   based fills had a buffer overflow.  This would overwrite the end of
   a malloc()ed buffer with double precision floats.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=35324
   CVE-2008-1928

 - check that the result of fileno($fh) is defined rather than simply
   true when read() or write() is supplied with an fh parameter.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=35139

 - i_scale_axis() wasn't checking the result of i_img_new_ch()
   resulting in a SIGSEGV when attempting to scale an image to a size
   too large to fit in memory.  This is a NULL pointer access issue,
   not a buffer overflow.
   Added a check for the failure.
   scale_calculate() (and hence scale()) will now fail if any of the
   scale size parameters are a reference.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=35172

 - Regression: filling a greyscale image with a hatch used the wrong
   color channels from the supplied fg/bg colors.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=35278

 - fixed a related problem for image fills.

Imager 0.63 - 7 April 2008
===========

This release primarily contains changes to improve ease of use -
rather than you having to convert images to the appropriate number of
channels, Imager handles it internally.  How to handle drawing colors
and the default combine mode is a thornier problem left for some other
release.

 - the font libraries are now only initialized when needed.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28825

 - moved the imtoc.perl code into Imager::Preprocess

 - paste() and rubthrough() now adapt the source image data to the
   destination, so you can now safely paste/rubthrough from greyscale
   images to color images or back, or from alpha channel images to
   noalpha channels or back.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30908

 - rubthrough() now falls back to pasting when the source doesn't have
   an alpha channel.  This effectively treats the source as having a
   max alpha channel, the right thing to do.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29944

 - re-worked most of the area filling code to use a common set of
   functions when filling.
   Corrected normal combine mode.
   Rewrote most of the combine modes to match the way the SVG draft
   defines them with respect to a translucent source and destination.
   Added tests for translucent source and destination.
   Added tests to check 8-bit/sample and double/sample combines work
   similarly.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29879

 - writing a 2 or 4 channel image to a JPEG file will now write that
   image as if composited against a background, black by default,
   overridable with the i_background tag/parameter.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29876

 - writing a 2 or 4 channel image to a PGM/PPM file will now write
   that image as if composited against a background, black by default,
   overridable with the i_background tag/parameter.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30074

 - writing a 2 or 4 channel image to a BMP file will now write that
   image as if composited against a background, black by default,
   overridable with the i_background tag/parameter.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30075

Bug fixes:

 - Imager::Matrix2d->translate() now only requires one of the x or y
   parameters.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29937

 - mixing qtype scaling now sets all channels of a pixel to zero if
   the pixel has zero coverage (zero alpha).  This should produce more
   compressible output files.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=32324

 - removed the pointless #! line from lib/Imager/Font/Wrap.pm
   Noticed when I saw:
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=166254
   I'm not changing the #! lines of the sample code, since it's sample
   code, not intended for installation.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=33408

 - some TGA images weren't being detected correctly as TGA images
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=32925

 - handling of the left-over bit for 16-bit/pixel TGA images has been
   changed to match the behaviour of the GIMP.  Previously the bit
   being set was treated as an opaque pixel, but one user reported a
   problem with loading such an image.  I haven't been able to find any
   tools beyond the GIMP that handle alpha-channel 16-bit TGAs, so
   I'll match it's behaviour.  See issue 114913 in the GIMP's
   bugzilla.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=32926

Imager 0.62 - 10 December 2007
===========

 - Makefile.PL now expands ~/path supplied to --incpath or --libpath
   to /path under your home directory.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29484

 - the old dynaload code used Mach API functions to load dynamic
   libraries on Mac OS X.  These APIs have been deprecated in OS X
   10.5 and were causing some build problems.
   So henceforth Imager uses the dlopen() family of functions, and you
   will need version 10.3 or later of OS X.

 - added the det() function to the transform2() engine.
   added the sample quad_to_square.pl
   Courtesy Richard Fairhurst.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=31244

Bug fixes:

 - samples/gifscale.pl sourced the base value for gif_top from
   gif_left.
   Thanks to Eleneldil G. Arilou for pointing this out.

 - t/t82inline.t no longer loads B at runtime, to work around a bug
   in some 5.005_0[45] installations.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30508

 - work around Module::Depends::Intrusive bug #21229
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30520

 - the hardinvert filter no-longer inverts the alpha channel.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30002

 - the hardinvert filter now supports large samples

Imager 0.61_02 - 28 November 2007
==============

 - major TIFF support re-work
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20329

 - added a C level image interface for accessing samples from 1-32
   bits, exposed this at the perl level in getsamples()

 - the conv filter now works at floating point precision for high bit
   images

 - added is_bilevel method to test whether an image should be written as
   a bilevel image if the image format supports it.

 - added -log-stderr as an Imager import list option

 - added some important types to Imager::APIRef

 - added test_image_double() to Imager::Test

Bug fixes:

 - Imager::Fountain couldn't read GIMP gradient files with 10 or more
   segments

 - the scale() method with qtype mixing now handles images with an
   alpha channel correctly.

 - fixed a broken link from the "animated GIF" entry in the concept index.
   Thanks to Slaven Rezic.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30889

 - on some perl's the infix expression parser test would fail due to
   actions in the grammar returning false.  Made sure all actions return
   a true value.
   Thanks to Richard Fairhurst for spending a lot of time in tracking
   down this problem.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=29562

Imager 0.61 - 5 November 2007
===========

 - added samples/gifscale.pl, which adjusts the screen size/position tags
   when scaling an animated gif
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27591

Bug fixes:

 - correct handling of sz in matrix_transform() - this should allow
   perspective type transformations to work now.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29936

 - prevent a cast to integer warning on x64 builds in datatypes.c
   also fixed some other type warnings
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30204

 - some sub-directory tests depended on files produced by the parent
   directory tests
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30203

 - Imager::Font::Wrap doesn't correctly set savepos
   thanks to Nikita Dedik and Eleneldil G. Arilou for reporting this.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29771

 - test 171 in t/t01introvert.t was failing on perls configured to
   use long double.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29413

 - the code for the transform2() uminus operator was missing a break.
   Added tests for better code coverage of the ops.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29296

 - the SGI RLE compression code could overflow its compression buffer
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30334

 - the 32-bit output function used by the SGI code only handled values
   under 0x10000.  This was most noticable when writing large RLE images.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30335

 - validate chan_count for chans == NULL for each of the i_gsamp()
   implementations.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28985

 - attempt to work around the test failure at
   http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2007/09/msg650810.html
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29562

 - improve the error messages produced when attempting to read or write
   an unknown image file format.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30103

 - improve the transform2() documentation
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29267

 - correctly generate the author key in META.yml
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30377

 - correctly blend a rotated (or matrix_transformed()) image when
   performing interpolation in the presence of an alpha channel.
   Also corrected the centring of the rotated image on the output
   image.

Imager 0.60 - 30 August 2007
===========

 - Finished/rewrote Arnar's old SGI RGB file format support, so Imager
   now has full SGI RGB image format, including RLE and 16-bit/sample
   images.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8666

 - logging functions are now available in the API

 - applied Gabriel Vasseur's patch
   added documentation, further tests, and support for greyscale images
   Obviously problems are my fault :)
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28142

 - the mask for ICO/CUR images is now applied as an alpha channel to
   the returned image.  For the old behaviour, supply ico_masked => 0
   to read() or read_multi().  This should be less confusing when
   using Imager as a general image processor.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29001

Bug fixes:

 - in some cases it's possible for giflib/libungif to return color
   indexes outside the range of colors defined by the image's palette.
   We now expand the palette to match the indexes used.
   Thanks to Gabriel Vasseur for reporting this.

 - fixed various memory leaks that could occur when failing to read png,
   jpeg, bmp or tga files.

 - to avoid confusion, channels not present in the image are returned as
   zero by getscanline().  This has no effect on the C level i_glin()
   and i_glinf() API functions which continue to not set the unused
   channels.

 - the convert() method now returns an image of the same sample size as
   the source image.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28492

 - remove repeated text in Imager::Files
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27589

 - be even more explicit that scale() and friends don't modify the source
   image, but return a new image.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28570

 - improve the error message from errstr() when you try to load a font
   for which the driver hasn't been built in Imager.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27571

 - transparency is now enabled by default when writing GIF images
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27615

 - Imager would not load on Windows 98
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27653

Imager 0.59 - 14 June 2007
===========

Bug fixes:

 - fixes a regression introduced by the fixes for RT 11972
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27546

 - cropping outside the image would return an Imager object with
   no low-level image object, instead of returning false.
   Fixed by: Philip Gwyn (Leolo)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27509

Imager 0.58 - 16 May 2007
===========

No significant changes from 0.57_01.

Imager 0.57_01 - 11 May 2007
==============

 - added to_rgb16 to produce a 16-bit/sample version of an image

 - improve freetype 1.x text output efficiency

Bug fixes:

 - search another place for rgb.txt, and check all the places
   Imager::Color checks when deciding whether to skip testing it
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=26064

 - use a convolution kernel size based on the stddev rather than a
   fixed size when performing a gaussian blur
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=25645

 - document the difference() method's mindist parameter, and debug it.

 - put the Imager release number in the Inline::C generated code to
   regenerate Inline code when a new release of Imager is installed.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=26278

 - fix rendering on alpha channel images for the FreeType 1.x driver.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=11972

 - fix rendering on alpha channel images for the T1lib driver.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=11972

 - reworked library probing, we can now set more than one probe
   function for a library.  Disabled the default (non-freetype-config)
   library probe and added an extra probe function that searches for
   both ft2build.h and whatever it includes, and adds -I as needed.
   Hopefully this will fix build problems like
   http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2007/05/msg472281.html
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=26086

Imager 0.57 - 30 Apr 2007
===========

This is a maintenence release fixing a security issue in Imager.

 - CRITICAL: a specially crafted compressed BMP file can cause a buffer
   overflow in malloced memory.  There will be further discussion of
   this issue in the ticket below.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=26811
   CVE-2007-2459  CVE-2007-2413
   The descriptions at cve.mitre.org varied in quality, please see the
   ticket at rt.cpan.org for a more accurate description of the issue.

Imager 0.56 - 1 Apr 2007
===========

 - added support for reading 16-bit/sample PGM/PPM images

 - added support for writing 16-bit/sample PGM/PPM images

 - improved performance of reading PBM/PGM/PPM images

 - added support for writing PBM images if the image is paletted and
   contains only black and white

 - added a new make_colors value - "mono"

 - switched from the svn log Changes to a manual Changes to reduce
   noise

 - new sample code - samples/flasher.pl

Bug fixes:

 - CRITICAL: the "Imager" typemap entry (not used by Imager itself)
   was returning an image object with an extra reference, this
   resulted in a memory leak.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24992

 - fix rendering on alpha channel images for the FreeType 2.x driver
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=11972

 - reading bmp files now consitently handles short reads.  You can now
   supply a parameter to treat a short read as successful and set
   i_incomplete
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8426

 - previously, reading ASCII PBM files required spaces between samples,
   even though the format doesn't require that

 - improved documentation of the unsharpmask filter (I hope)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=25531

 - force flushing of the output from i_tt_dump_names() and test output
   in t/t35ttfont.t to prevent output from being mixed up.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24859

 - rewrite a conditional expression as an if() to hopefully work around
   a bug in the pre-4.0 GCC Apple shipped with OS X 10.4.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=25561

 - avoid Data::Dumper in regops.perl to support older releases of perl
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24391

Imager 0.55 - 16 Dec 2006
===========

This is primarily a bug fix release.

Note: Test::More is now a pre-requisite for Imager and is no longer bundled.

There is one new feature:

 - the Win32 font driver now supports UTF8 (RT 22166)
   http://www.cpanforum.com/threads/3276
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=22166

Several bugs were fixed:

 - the string() method would not output the string "0"
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=21770

 - fills.c was failing to compile on Solaris 10 (compiler unknown)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=21944

 - the gif_disposal and gif_user_input tags weren't being read from
   the file correctly
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=22192

 - gif.c was failing to build under MSVC
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=23922

 - in some cases strings passed to the string() method were treated as
   terminated by NUL (chr 0)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=21770

 - on "MSWin32" perl builds we now link to -lzlib instead of -lz since
   that's the default build name for zlib on Win32.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=23064

 - search $Config{incpath} for headers too, which we should have been
   doing all along.

Win32 font driver fixes:

 - the global descent value from bounding box was the wrong sign
   http://www.cpanforum.com/threads/3276

 - if the first or last glyph overflowed the left or right side of the
   advance width they would be clipped

Imager 0.54 - 14 Sep 2006
===========

This is primarily a feature release:

 - a new qtype value 'mixing' has been added to the scale()
   method. This is faster than 'normal', slower than 'preview'. This
   is based on the method used by pnmscale, and seems to produce less
   blurry results than normal.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20677

 - the rubthrough() method can now render onto images with an alpha
   channel.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20678

 - the read_multi() method now falls back to calling doing a single
   image read via the read() method and write_multi() will now fall
   back to calling write() if a single image is supplied. This means
   you can simply call the read_multi() or write_multi() functions
   without having to check if the type is formatted by that method.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19457
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19458

 - the GIF loop extension can now be written. If you don't have
   libungif/giflib 4.1.4 (or some distribution's bugfixed equivalent) you
   should upgrade.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=21185

 - getscanline() and setscanline() can now read/write palette index
   based data from/to the image for paletted images, by setting type to
   'index'.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20338

 - we no longer hassle you to disable GIF support
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20687

 - minor documentation fixes

Imager 0.53 - 26 Jul 2006
===========

This is a bugfix release.

Some test code was left in a code path not covered by the test
suite. A test was added to cover this code path and the test code was
removed.
http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20705

Imager 0.52 - 25 Jul 2006
===========

This is primarily a feature release, but contains a fair few bug
fixes, new features:

 - ability to read and write MS Windows ICO and CUR files

 - you can now add file format plugins to support new file formats

 - add POD coverage tests

 - setcolors() and addcolors() now accept color names and so on
   instead of requiring Imager::Color objects.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20056

 - flood_fill() can now fill to a specified border color instead of
   just to the area the same color as the seed.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=19618

Bug fixes:

 - bounding_box for the T1 driver wasn't converting UTF8 to ascii when
   calculating the advance width.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20554

 - bounding_box for the T1 driver wasn't including leading and
   trailing spaces in the bounding box as the other drivers did, it also
   produced strange results for empty strings or strings containing only
   spaces

 - when reading CMYK jpeg images they were being transferred to the
   image object as is, producing a four channel image. It only looked ok
   due to an old still unfixed Photoshop bug. We now convert from the
   inverted CMYK that photoshop (and Corel for example) produce into RGB.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20416

 - reading a CYMK TIFF would result in a 4 channel image, reading any
   image with more than 4 channels (eg. RGB with 2 alpha channels) would
   result in an error.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20415

 - added /usr/local/include to the default include search path, since
   we were already searching /usr/local/lib for libraries.

And various minor fixes and documentation updates.

Imager 0.51 - 23 Apr 2006
===========

 - fix a validation bug when processing JPEG EXIF data that can cause
   a crash
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18496

 - fix mis-processing of the src_maxx and src_maxy parameters of the
   paste() method
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18712

 - fix a problem in Imager's "smart" handling of the color parameter
   to various methods.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18561

Imager 0.50 - 29 Mar 2006
===========

 - CRITICAL: fixes a segmentation fault from attempting to write a 2
   or 4 channel image to jpeg or a 2 channel image to tga where the
   output is an in-memeory buffer.
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18397

 - fixes an incorrect pointer parameter in the PNG code
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18051

 - skip Inline::C tests when building in a directory with spaces
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18049

# CPAN Security Advisory Database (CPANSA)

This is a database of the security advisories for the Perl modules uploaded to CPAN.

This is a hand-picked database maintained by the Perl community. See [CONTRIBUTING](/briandfoy/cpan-security-advisory/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
or the [issues](https://github.com/briandfoy/cpan-security-advisory/issues) to see how you might
help.

The main mirror is [briandfoy/cpan-security-advisory on GitHub](https://github.com/briandfoy/cpan-security-advisory),
but there are other copies:

* <https://github.com/briandfoy/cpan-security-advisory>
* <https://bitbucket.org/briandfoy/cpan-security-advisory>
* <https://gitlab.com/briandfoy/cpan-security-advisory>

If you want to mirror a copy, clone the repo and send me the link. Let's
make this more resilient by keeping the data in several places.

## Report new issues to the CPAN Security Group

For new issues without a CVE report, first [report
issues](https://security.metacpan.org/docs/report.html) to the [CPAN
Security Group](https://security.metacpan.org), which can analyze an
issue, collect additional information, and request a CVE. Once a CVE
is issued, we can add it to the CPAN Security Advisories.

## Sources

* metacpan.org - modules Changes files with security fixes
* CVE databases
  + <https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/xml/cve/misc/nvd-rss.xml>
* OS distributions security advisory feeds:
  + Debian <https://www.debian.org/security/dsa>
  + FreeBSD <http://vuxml.freebsd.org/freebsd/rss.xml>
  + Gentoo <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/feed.rss>
  + Ubuntu <https://usn.ubuntu.com/rss.xml>

## Setup your environment

To run the various programs, you'll need some Perl modules. Install
[cpanminus](https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/tree/devel/App-cpanminus)
if you don't already have it:

```
$ make -f Makefile.repo setup

```

## Finding a record

```
$ perl util/find_record CVE-2022-1234

```

## Making a new record

There's a utility to make a record for you from a CVE report:

```
$ perl util/make_record CVE-2022-1234

```

This tool tries to guess the distribution name, but sometimes it can't. If
it doesn't guess the distribution name, simply run it again with the
the distribution name you want:

```
$ perl util/make_record CVE-2022-1234 Some-Package

```

Then, add the report to the file `cpansa/CPANSA-Some-Package.yml`. If
there are already reports in that file, remember to strip the `---` from
the top of the output you just created.

### Record format

Id format: `CPANSA-<dist-name>-<year>-<sequence>`

* `dist-name` is the main module name, not necessarily the affected module in the distribution
* `year` is the year of the report or discovery, not necessarily the year the problem was introduced
* `sequence` is some integer. For single CVE reports, like CVE-2011-1589, use the same sequence number for easier maintenance

Database is in YAML format with a simple structure.

```
- id: CPANSA-Mojolicious-2011-01
  distribution: Mojolicious
  reported: 2011-04-05
  severity: critical
  description: >
    Directory traversal vulnerability in Path.pm in Mojolicious
    before 1.16 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a
    %2f..%2f (encoded slash dot dot slash) in a URI.
  cves:
    - CVE-2011-1589
  references:
    - https://github.com/mojolicious/mojo/commit/b09854988c5b5b6a2ba53cc8661c4b2677da3818
    - https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2011-1589/
  affected_versions: "< 1.16"
  fixed_versions: ">= 1.16"
```

There may be an additional `comments` key with more information about
the advisory, especially if the `description` comes from an external
source, such as a CVE report.

If the vulnerability is due to an embedded external library, add the
`embedded_vulnerability` key, e.g.

```
- affected_versions: ">=2.0.0"
  cves:
    - CVE-2021-46322
  description: >
    Duktape v2.99.99 was discovered to contain a SEGV vulnerability via the
    component duk_push_tval in duktape/duk_api_stack.c.
  distribution: JavaScript-Duktape
  fixed_versions: ~
  id: CPANSA-JavaScript-Duktape-2021-46322
  references:
    - https://github.com/svaarala/duktape/issues/2448
    - https://github.com/mamod/JavaScript-Duktape/issues/41
  reported: 2022-01-20
  severity: medium
  embedded_vulnerability:
    name: duktape
    distributed_version: "2.2.0"
```

In some cases, the embedded external library may be part of another
library. Add the parent library in brackets, e.g.

```
  embedded_vulnerability:
     distributed_version: "1.2.11"
     name: zlib[libgit2]
```

There may be cases whether the Perl distribution relies on a
particular version of another library with a security vulnerability
that is installed on the host system, rather than embedded. This may
be indicayed with the `external_vulnerability` key:

```
  external_vulnerability:
     distributed_version: "<=6.3"
     name: readline
```

## Check the results

Check all the files for basic YAML:

```
$ make test_all

```

Checking all the files can take a minute, so you can also just check
the files that have changed:

```
$ make test_new

```

Run the `lint` target to check all of the report files:

```
$ make lint

```

## Command-line checks

For command line checks take a look at [CPAN-Audit](https://metacpan.org/release/CPAN-Audit) module, or the
[cpan-audit repo](https://github.com/briandfoy/cpan-audit).

```
$ cpan-audit module Catalyst '>7.0'

```

To see your new report, you'll have to regenerate the `CPANSA::DB` database since
`CPAN::Audit` does everything locally. That happens in the [cpan-audit repo](https://github.com/briandfoy/cpan-audit),
where this repo is a submodule.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

| The delightfully complete bug-report indicates that this was over-running a buffer in Malloc heap, not a C buffer on the main stackframes, so any RCE exploitation will be harder than a classic C buffer overrun. (And stomping the malloc block headers gets detected because in the versions repored it wasn't totally optimistically optimi[zs]ed. Mac perl even had a checksum, nice!) I suppose there might be a FastCGI or similar web-server process somewhere using this module that could be DDOS'd by uploading this image repeatedly, crashing each worker. But that hypothetical DDOS isn't a great basis for a CVE without a demonstration or actual impact? … On Sun, Nov 17, 2024, 12:23 Stig \*\*\*@\*\*\*.\*\*\*> wrote: Can we verify if this has a security impact somehow?

| I don't think it's a hypothetical security impact. An image file causes it to crash, hence the bug report. Potential for Denial of Service, even if RCEs are difficult. So I think it's better to issue an advisory. I would rather err on the safe side. |

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
