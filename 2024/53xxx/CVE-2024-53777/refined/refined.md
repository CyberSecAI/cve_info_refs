- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Simple Header and Footer plugin (versions <= 1.0.0) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks sufficient CSRF protection, allowing malicious actors to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can force a higher privileged user to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact can vary depending on the actions available in the vulnerable plugin.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or loading a malicious page that makes a request to the vulnerable plugin. This can be achieved via social engineering, phishing, or other methods of inducing a user to trigger the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request. They do not require any prior authentication with the target system or plugin itself, only that they are able to successfully induce a logged-in user to trigger the forged request.
