In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: uvcvideo: Skip parsing frames of type UVC_VS_UNDEFINED in uvc_parse_format

This can lead to out of bounds writes since frames of this type were not
taken into account when calculating the size of the frames buffer in
uvc_parse_streaming.
