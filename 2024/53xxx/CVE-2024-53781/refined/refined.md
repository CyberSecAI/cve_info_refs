**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CSRF:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks, allowing attackers to potentially trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute unwanted actions. The specific impact depends on the actions that the plugin allows and what an attacker can trigger.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a malicious website or link that tricks an authenticated user into submitting a forged request to the vulnerable WordPress site where the plugin is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that will be executed by a logged-in user on the vulnerable website.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the vulnerable website, but they need the targeted user to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes**
*   The plugin is considered abandoned as it has not been updated for over a year.
*   The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS score of 7.1, but it is flagged as low priority by Patchstack
*   There is no official fix for this vulnerability. The recommended solution is to remove and replace the software.
