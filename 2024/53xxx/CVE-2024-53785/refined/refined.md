- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user can perform actions intended for higher-privileged users, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data modification, or other security breaches.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is present within the plugin's code, specifically within a function that lacks proper access control. A user with a subscriber role can exploit this.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber on the affected WordPress site.
