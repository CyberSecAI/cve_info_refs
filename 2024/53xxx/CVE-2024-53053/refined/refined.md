Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A deadlock occurs in the UFS (Universal Flash Storage) subsystem when updating the Real-Time Clock (RTC).

**Vulnerabilities:**
- The function `ufshcd_update_rtc` calls `ufshcd_rpm_put_sync()`.
- If the power management (PM) usage count is 0, `ufshcd_rpm_put_sync()` will trigger the runtime suspend callback.
- The runtime suspend callback waits for `ufshcd_rtc_work` to complete (flush), but `ufshcd_rtc_work` itself is blocked on `ufshcd_rpm_put_sync()`, creating a deadlock condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The system will become unresponsive due to the deadlock.
- The UFS storage operations will be stalled.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by the normal operation of the UFS driver, specifically during the RTC update process. No specific attacker action is needed to trigger the bug.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No specific attacker capabilities or position is required. The vulnerability can be triggered by the system itself.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix replaces `ufshcd_rpm_put_sync()` with `ufshcd_rpm_put()`. The `ufshcd_rpm_put` function does not wait for the power management operation to complete synchronously, avoiding the deadlock.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix was backported to stable kernel versions, including 6.11.x.
- The issue was introduced by commit `6bf999e0eb41 ("scsi: ufs: core: Add UFS RTC support")`.
