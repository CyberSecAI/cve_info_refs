Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin is vulnerable to XSS, which allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the website.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious actor can inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads.
- These scripts will be executed when guests visit the site, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into the website via the vulnerable plugin.
- Specific attack vectors are not detailed, but typically XSS vulnerabilities are exploited through input fields, query parameters, or other means where user-controlled data is reflected on the web page without proper sanitization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts, which usually can be done by a user with 'Contributor' privileges (as noted in the "Required privilege" section). The attacker doesn't need a high level of access to the system; a lower level of access to contribute to the website would be sufficient.
