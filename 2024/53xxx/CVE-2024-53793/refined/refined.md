- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The eDoc Easy Tables plugin for WordPress lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site while authenticated.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor could craft a request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, would perform actions within the vulnerable plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into triggering a malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
