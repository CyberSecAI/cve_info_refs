- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A low-privileged user can bypass SPL safeguards for risky commands by running a saved search with a risky command using the permissions of a higher-privileged user through the “s“ parameter on the “/en-US/app/search/report“ endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control/privilege escalation, Risky command safeguards bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A low-privileged user can execute risky commands with elevated privileges, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to phish the victim into initiating a request within their browser, exploiting a vulnerability in the “/en-US/app/search/report” endpoint by using the “s” parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user, capable of crafting a malicious URL and tricking a higher-privileged user into clicking on it. The attacker must also have knowledge of a saved search containing risky commands. The vulnerability requires user interaction.
