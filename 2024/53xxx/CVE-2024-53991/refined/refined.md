- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration in Nginx that allows an attacker to potentially access Discourse backup files when using `FileStore::LocalStore` if the attacker knows the name of the backup file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is related to the handling of backup files when stored locally. Nginx can be tricked into serving these files due to a lack of proper access control or path validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a confidentiality breach by exposing backup files. These backup files likely contain sensitive information, including database content and application configurations.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to craft a specific HTTP request to retrieve the backup file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to know the name of the backup file and must be able to send HTTP requests to the server. No privileges or user interaction are required to exploit this vulnerability.
