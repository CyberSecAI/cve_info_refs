Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-53262

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way SvelteKit handles error messages in its static `error.html` template. The placeholders `%sveltekit.status%` and `%sveltekit.error.message%` are replaced with the corresponding values without proper escaping. This allows for potential injection of malicious code if the error message contains user-controlled content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the lack of output escaping, which leads to a reflected XSS vulnerability. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into an error message.
- **Unescaped Output:** The core of the issue is that the `%sveltekit.error.message%` placeholder is replaced without escaping HTML entities, therefore any HTML or javascript in that message will be rendered as code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the victim's browser.
- **Data theft:** This could lead to stealing cookies or performing other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Page Manipulation:** An attacker could redirect the user to malicious sites or perform any action the user can take on the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Server-Side Error Generation:**  The attacker needs to influence the error message generated by the server. This could happen in a server-side `handle` function or a `+server.js` request handler by including user-controlled input in the error message using the `error()` helper function.
- **Injection via User Input:** The attack occurs when user-provided data is incorporated into an error message that is then rendered in the `error.html` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject or influence content that is used within a server-side error message generated by the application.
- The attacker must be able to trigger an error that includes their injected message, resulting in the display of the `error.html` page.
-  The attacker does not require high privileges, low privileges are sufficient and the attack complexity is high since the user input needs to end up in the error message.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability only affects applications that explicitly create errors with messages that contain user-controlled content.
- Uncaught errors do not expose this vulnerability because they always render the message "Internal error" which does not contain user-controlled content.
- The fix involves escaping the message string before it's inserted into the HTML output.

The fix was implemented in commit `134e36343ef57ed7e6e2b3bb9e7f05ad37865794` by escaping the error message before being inserted into the `error.html` template.

The fix was included in version 2.8.3.
