The provided content relates to a fix for a potential issue in the `amd_pmc` driver where the system could attempt to ioremap an invalid address if the Spill to DRAM STB feature is not enabled. This is addressed by the commit `bceec87a73804bb4c33b9a6c96e2d27cd893a801` and backported into multiple stable branches.

Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability and the fix:

**Root Cause:**
- The amd_pmc driver attempts to use the Spill to DRAM (STB) feature.
- When the STB is not enabled on the system, the driver receives an invalid address (0x0) for the STB physical address.
- The driver attempts to ioremap this invalid address, leading to a kernel warning and potential instability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Invalid Memory Access:** The driver was attempting to map an invalid memory address.
- **Lack of proper error handling:** The driver didn't check the validity of the STB address before attempting to ioremap it.
- **Potential Kernel Instability:**  Attempting to map an invalid address can lead to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Warnings:** The immediate impact is a warning message in the kernel log ("ioremap on RAM at 0x0000000000000000 ...").
- **Potential instability**: Although not directly stated in the provided text, mapping address zero can lead to undefined behaviour, potentially crashing the kernel.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by loading the `amd_pmc` module with the `enable_stb=1` parameter on a system where STB is not enabled. This can be achieved with root privileges on the machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Root Privileges:** The attacker needs to have root access to load kernel modules with the specific `enable_stb` parameter set.
- **System-Specific Configuration:** The target system must have an AMD processor that supports the STB feature but has it disabled.

**Fix:**
- The fix introduces a check in the `amd_pmc_s2d_init` function to verify if the STB address (obtained via `S2D_PHYS_ADDR_LOW` and `S2D_PHYS_ADDR_HIGH` commands) is valid.
- If both `phys_addr_hi` and `phys_addr_low` are 0, the function prints an error message ("STB is not enabled on the system; disable enable_stb or contact system vendor") and returns `-EINVAL` to prevent further processing.
- This prevents the driver from attempting to ioremap the invalid address and provides a more user-friendly error message.
