Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-53364:

**1. Verification of CVE relation:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2024-53364, and specifically mentions "SQL Injection in PHPGURUKUL Vehicle Parking Management System v1.13". This confirms the content's relevance to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input, specifically the `viewid` parameter in the `view-detail.php` page. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is an SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful SQL injection can lead to:
    *   Unauthorized code execution (potentially on the database server).
    *   Exposure of sensitive information from the database (data breach).
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the HTTP GET parameter `viewid` in the `/users/view-detail.php` page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to access the vulnerable page.

**3. Technical Details and Description:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `view-detail.php` file of the "PHPGURUKUL Vehicle Parking Management System v1.13".
*   The `viewid` parameter is susceptible to SQL injection.
*   The attacker can inject malicious SQL queries into this parameter by crafting a malicious URL.
*   The content mentions that this could lead to both unauthorized code execution and information disclosure.
*   The proof of concept (PoC) is described as navigating to `/users/view-detail.php` and injecting SQL queries into the `viewid` parameter.

**4. Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mohammed Athif in October 2024.
*   The references section includes links to the official CVE record and the NVD entry.
