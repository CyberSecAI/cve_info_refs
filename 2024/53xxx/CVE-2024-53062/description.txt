In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mgb4: protect driver against spectre

Frequency range is set from sysfs via frequency_range_store(),
being vulnerable to spectre, as reported by smatch:

	drivers/media/pci/mgb4/mgb4_cmt.c:231 mgb4_cmt_set_vin_freq_range() warn: potential spectre issue 'cmt_vals_in' [r]
	drivers/media/pci/mgb4/mgb4_cmt.c:238 mgb4_cmt_set_vin_freq_range() warn: possible spectre second half.  'reg_set'

Fix it.
