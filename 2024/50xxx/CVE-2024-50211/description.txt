In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udf: refactor inode_bmap() to handle error

Refactor inode_bmap() to handle error since udf_next_aext() can return
error now. On situations like ftruncate, udf_extend_file() can now
detect errors and bail out early without resorting to checking for
particular offsets and assuming internal behavior of these functions.
