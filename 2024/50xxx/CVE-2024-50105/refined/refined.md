The provided content relates to a fix for a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's ASoC (Audio System on Chip) subsystem, specifically concerning the SC7280 sound card driver. This vulnerability is a result of a missing Soundwire runtime stream allocation.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- A previous commit (15c7fab0e047) moved the allocation of the Soundwire stream runtime from the Qualcomm Soundwire driver to individual machine sound card drivers.
- The SC7280 sound card driver was not updated to perform this allocation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Missing allocation of the Soundwire runtime stream in the SC7280 driver.
- This results in a NULL pointer dereference or other effects due to uninitialized memory access during sound playback.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-  A NULL pointer dereference or uninitialized memory access during sound playback, potentially leading to system instability or crashes.

**Attack vectors:**

- Triggering sound playback using the SC7280 sound card.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to initiate sound playback on a system using the affected SC7280 sound card.
