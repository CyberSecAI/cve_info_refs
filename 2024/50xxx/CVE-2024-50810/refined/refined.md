- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `AddCommentView` function in `apps\comment\views.py` does not properly sanitize user input before rendering it to the frontend. Specifically, it does not filter out malicious JavaScript code embedded within HTML tags, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected through the comment functionality and stored in the database. This code will then execute when other users view the comment.
    - **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-provided content, allowing HTML and JavaScript to be interpreted by the browser.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
    - This can lead to various attacks, including:
        - Session hijacking.
        - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
        - Data theft.
        - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
        - Defacing the website.
        - In this specific report, the attacker mentions that they can induce administrators to elevate ordinary users to administrators through the `/adminx/oauth/user/2/change/` endpoint.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through the comment submission functionality.
    - An attacker can insert malicious JavaScript code within the `content` parameter of a POST request to `/comment/add/`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to submit comments to the website.
    - No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability as the attacker does not need to be an admin.
