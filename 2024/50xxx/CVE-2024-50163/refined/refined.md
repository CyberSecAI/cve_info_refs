Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commits:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the shared use of `bpf_redirect_info` between the SKB (socket buffer) and XDP (eXpress Data Path) redirect paths within the Linux kernel's BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) subsystem. Specifically, the same numerical flag values were being used in the `ri->flags` field for different purposes in these paths (e.g., `BPF_F_BROADCAST` was equal to `BPF_F_NEXTHOP`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Flag Value Overlap:** The primary issue is that the same flag values (`BPF_F_BROADCAST` and `BPF_F_NEXTHOP`) were used to represent different meanings in the SKB and XDP redirect paths. This could cause confusion and incorrect behavior.
- **Shared `bpf_redirect_info` struct:** The `bpf_redirect_info` structure was being shared between the SKB and XDP paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash:** An attacker could trigger a kernel crash by using `skb bpf_redirect_neigh()` with a non-NULL `params` argument, followed by an XDP redirect using the same `bpf_redirect_info` struct. This happens because the XDP path interprets the flags incorrectly due to the overlap, leading to a crash. Syzbot was able to reproduce this issue.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **BPF Program:** An attacker could craft a malicious BPF program that utilizes both SKB and XDP redirect functionalities in a specific sequence to trigger the vulnerability. This requires the ability to load BPF programs into the kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **BPF Loading Capability:** The attacker needs the ability to load BPF programs into the kernel. This typically requires root or `CAP_BPF` capabilities.
- **Control over Network Traffic:** The attacker needs to be able to influence network traffic in a way that triggers the described sequence of SKB and XDP redirects.

**Additional Details:**
- **Fix:** The fix involves:
    -   Making the `bpf_redirect_info` structure stack-allocated to prevent sharing it between the SKB and XDP paths
    -   Reorganizing and redefining the flag definitions. The flags in `BPF_F_REDIRECT_INTERNAL` are redefined to avoid overlaps with XDP flags.
    -   Adding a `BUILD_BUG_ON()` check to detect future accidental re-introduction of the overlap.
- **Affected Functionality:** The vulnerability is within the BPF redirect functionality, specifically the use of `bpf_redirect_neigh()` and XDP redirects when combined with certain parameters.
-   The commit messages reference syzbot, which indicates that a fuzzer was used to find the vulnerability.

In summary, this is a vulnerability caused by reusing the same flag values for different purposes in a shared data structure within the kernel's BPF subsystem which could lead to a kernel crash. The fix addresses the root cause by separating flag usage and preventing shared state and includes an assertion to prevent future regressions.
