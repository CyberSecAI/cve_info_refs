{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `push_urls()` and `get_urls()` functions in `\\apps\\tool\\apis\\bd_push.py` do not properly validate user-supplied URLs before making HTTP requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The application allows attackers to control the destination of HTTP requests made by the server.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can make the server send requests to arbitrary internal or external resources, potentially gaining access to internal services, leaking sensitive information, or performing other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `url` parameter in the `POST /tool/baidu-linksubmit-sitemap/` request. Specifically, the `map_url` parameter which is passed to `get_urls()` and the `url` parameter which is passed to `push_urls()` function are vulnerable.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required as the interface is an open API."
