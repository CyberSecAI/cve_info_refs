{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the application attempts to cast input to an integer using `(int)`, which does not prevent SQL injection due to PHP's type juggling behavior. A string like `'123abc'` will be cast to the integer `123`, allowing malicious SQL code to pass the integer type check and be used in a query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection due to insufficient input validation and usage of raw queries.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and its data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP POST requests to the `update` function in the `ControllerResponsesListingGridCollections` and `ControllerResponsesListingGridEmailTemplates` controllers. Specifically, the `id` parameter is vulnerable.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints. The attacker must also be authenticated with high privileges to access the vulnerable admin routes."
