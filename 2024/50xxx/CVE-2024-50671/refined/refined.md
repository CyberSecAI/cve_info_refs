Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-50671:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect access control implementation within the Adapt Authoring Tool. Specifically, the permission verification logic is flawed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The application incorrectly validates user permissions for the "Get users" feature.
- **Wildcard Misuse:** The use of a wildcard character in permitted URLs grants unintended access to endpoints that should be restricted to "Super Admin" roles only. This allows users with lower privileges ("Authenticated User" roles) to access sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers with "Authenticated User" roles can successfully obtain all registered email addresses.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the Adapt Authoring Tool.
- The specific endpoint for "Get users" is vulnerable to this access control bypass.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an "Authenticated User" of the Adapt Authoring Tool, which implies having a registered account.
- The attacker needs network access to the Adapt Authoring Tool instance.
