- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of multiple parameters belonging to the "basic_htm" API. These unsanitized parameters are concatenated into OS level commands, leading to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-78 "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')".
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to gain full, unrestricted root access to the affected wireless access point.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed via the "basic_htm" API, specifically through multiple parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the affected device to exploit the vulnerability.
