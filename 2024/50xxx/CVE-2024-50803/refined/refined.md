Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-50803:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
*   It stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when uploading files to the mediapool feature of Redaxo.
* Specifically, uploading a malicious SVG file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:**  The primary weakness is the ability to store malicious JavaScript code within the Redaxo application. The malicious code is embedded in a SVG file and stored in the mediapool, which can then be executed when the file is accessed by another user.
*  **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate SVG files uploaded by users before storing them in the mediapool. This allows an attacker to inject and persist malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers who access the malicious content.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially steal session cookies, leading to account compromise.
*   **Data Theft:**  The attacker could potentially steal sensitive information accessed by the user in the application.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites or install malware on their machines.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers could potentially deface the web application by altering displayed content.
*  **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided content, depending on the role of the user who views the malicious SVG, an attacker could potentially escalate their privileges if that user has administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious SVG file via the mediapool feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Redaxo User Account:** The attacker needs an account with sufficient privileges to upload files to the mediapool.
*   **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Redaxo versions prior to 5.18.0.
*   The fix is to upgrade to Redaxo version 5.18.0 or later.
