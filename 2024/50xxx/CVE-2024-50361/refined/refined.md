- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of multiple parameters within the "certificate\_file\_remove" API, leading to OS command injection. Specifically, these unsanitized parameters are concatenated into OS-level commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection').
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation grants an authenticated user full, unrestricted root access to the vulnerable wireless access point.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the "certificate\_file\_remove" API, by providing malicious input through multiple parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the affected devices.
