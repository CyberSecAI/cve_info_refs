Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-50558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control for read-only users on affected devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **CWE-284: Improper Access Control:** The system does not properly restrict access for read-only users, allowing them to perform actions that should be restricted, thus violating access control policies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a temporary denial of service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The attack is network-based (AV:N).
-   The attack does not require user interaction (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to have low-level privileges (PR:L), indicating they need to be a read-only user on the system.
-   No special attack complexity or conditions are required, as the attack can be launched with low complexity (AC:L)
