The provided content is related to CVE-2024-50293.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the `__smc_create()` function in `net/smc/af_smc.c` not clearing `sock->sk` when `smc_create_clcsk()` fails. This leaves a dangling socket pointer if `smc_create_clcsk()` fails.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Dangling socket pointer: If the call to `smc_create_clcsk()` fails, the socket's `sk` pointer is not cleared. This leads to a dangling pointer, which can cause issues later when the socket is accessed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The primary impact is a kernel crash due to a dangling pointer dereference. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) situation.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by a local or potentially remote attacker capable of creating an AF_SMC socket. The vulnerability is triggered when the `smc_create_clcsk` function fails within the `__smc_create` function in the kernel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the capability to create a socket of type AF_SMC (family 43), type 1, and protocol 0. This usually requires local access to the system or potentially remote access if the system exposes the required APIs. The attacker does not need elevated privileges to create a socket.
