Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a flaw in the business logic of the "Add to Cart" functionality within the itsourcecode Agri-Trading Online Shopping System 1.0. The application incorrectly handles negative or zero values for the "quant" (quantity) parameter when adding products to the cart.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Business Logic Flaw:** The application does not validate or sanitize the "quant" parameter, allowing users to input values like "-0". This results in incorrect total price calculations.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The system fails to properly validate the quantity value before using it in calculations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Price Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the total price of items in their shopping cart to zero.
- **Free Items:** By setting the quantity to "-0", attackers can add items to their cart with a zero price, effectively getting them for free.
- **Bypassing Payment:** Attackers can proceed to checkout and place orders without paying the actual price of the items.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Request Manipulation:** Attackers intercept the "Add to Cart" request using tools like Burp Suite.
- **Parameter Modification:** The attacker modifies the `quant` parameter in the request, changing the value from the intended positive number to `-0`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept web requests, such as with a proxy tool.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker should have a basic understanding of HTTP requests and parameters.
- **User Account:** The attacker needs a registered user account in the affected application.
