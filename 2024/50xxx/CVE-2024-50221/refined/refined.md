Based on the provided information, the content is related to CVE-2024-50221.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is an insufficient size allocation for the GPU metrics table in the `vangogh_tables_init()` function within the AMD GPU driver. Specifically, when support for `gpu_metrics_v2_4` was introduced, the allocated size for the metrics table was not updated to accommodate the new, larger structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The `smu_cmn_init_soft_gpu_metrics()` function attempts to write data into a memory region that is larger than the allocated buffer for `gpu_metrics_table`, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Incorrect size calculation:** The code initially determines the size of the `gpu_metrics_table` based on older structure sizes (`gpu_metrics_v2_2` and `gpu_metrics_v2_3`) and does not account for the size of `gpu_metrics_v2_4`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory corruption:** The out-of-bounds write can cause memory corruption, which can lead to system instability, crashes, or potentially other exploitable behavior.
- **Kernel crash (KASAN report):** The Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASAN) detects the out-of-bounds write, leading to a kernel panic and associated crash reports. This indicates that a system is not stable and potentially not usable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the AMD GPU driver initializes the `gpu_metrics_table`.
- The specific scenario is related to the initialization of the Vangogh GPU.
- The vulnerability is triggered when `smu_cmn_init_soft_gpu_metrics()` is called, particularly when GPU metrics are requested, for example through the sysfs interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger the initialization of the AMD GPU driver, specifically on systems using the Vangogh GPU. This is typically part of the normal boot or driver loading process.
- No special privileges are needed to trigger the bug as it occurs within normal kernel execution.
- The attacker would not need a specific physical position on the system.
