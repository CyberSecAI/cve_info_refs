The provided content relates to CVE-2024-50126.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `taprio_dump()` function within the Linux kernel's networking scheduler subsystem. This occurs because the function accesses `oper` and `admin` pointers that could be freed by another thread.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The `taprio_dump()` function dereferences pointers (`oper` and `admin`) that can be freed concurrently, leading to a use-after-free condition. This is because the function does not use any synchronization mechanisms when accessing these pointers.
- Lack of proper synchronization: The code was missing an RCU read-side critical section to protect access to shared data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a kernel crash, potentially resulting in denial of service. It can also potentially allow attackers to gain further privileges. 
- As the provided KASAN output shows, it can result in the kernel crashing due to an attempt to read freed memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `tc_fill_qdisc` and related netlink functions. 
- An attacker could send a crafted netlink message that triggers the `taprio_dump()` function while concurrently freeing the underlying data structures.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network packets that result in the kernel executing the vulnerable code path. This typically means having some level of network access or the ability to execute commands that can send netlink messages.
- The vulnerability was found on a KASAN-enabled arm64 system so the attacker needs to target a system running a vulnerable kernel version on a similar architecture.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through syzkaller, a kernel fuzzer.
- The fix involves adding an RCU read-side critical section around the access to the `oper` and `admin` pointers in the `taprio_dump()` function to ensure they are not freed while the function is using them.
- The vulnerability is not known to have been exploited in the wild but can be exploited by a crafted netlink message.
