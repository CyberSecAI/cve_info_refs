- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ad7124_write_raw()` function in the Linux kernel driver `drivers/iio/adc/ad7124.c` does not validate the input parameter `val` which can potentially be zero.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A division-by-zero vulnerability exists in `ad7124_set_channel_odr()` when the `DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST()` macro is used with a zero divisor. The `ad7124_write_raw()` function is called through a chain of function calls (`iio_write_channel_raw()`, `iio_write_channel_attribute()`, `iio_channel_write()`) without any checks to ensure `val` is non-zero.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploiting this vulnerability will cause a kernel crash (division by zero), leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by writing a zero value to the sample frequency attribute of an AD7124 ADC channel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to write to the IIO channel attributes, which typically requires local access with appropriate privileges.
