- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of multiple parameters within the "mp_apply" API. These parameters are concatenated into OS-level commands without proper neutralization of special elements, leading to OS command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-78, OS Command Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to gain full, unrestricted root access to the vulnerable wireless access point.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted requests to the "mp_apply" API with malicious payloads in the vulnerable parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability.
