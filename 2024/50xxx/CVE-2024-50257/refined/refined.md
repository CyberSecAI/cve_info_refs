The provided content relates to CVE-2024-50257.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability occurs in the `get_info()` function within the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem, specifically in the `x_tables.c` file. This happens when the `ip6table_nat` module is unloaded concurrently with a call to `get_info()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The vulnerability arises because the code attempts to access a module's `me` member (module reference counter) after the module has been freed due to module unloading, specifically when the module is removed from the `xt_templates` list and a concurrent get_info() call is made.
- Race condition: The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition between the module unload process and the execution of `get_info()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash: The use-after-free can lead to a kernel crash, as indicated by the provided warning messages and call traces. This could result in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by concurrently unloading a netfilter module (`ip6table_nat`) and calling `get_info()` via the `getsockopt` system call (specifically using `do_ip6t_get_ctl`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to unload kernel modules (requires root privileges).
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger a `getsockopt` call on a raw IPv6 socket. This is typically an unprivileged operation.
- The attacker needs to be able to create a race condition, executing `get_info()` at the same time module unloading is in progress.

**More Details:**
The provided content includes the following details:
- Specific kernel versions where the vulnerability is triggered.
- The exact call trace that leads to the crash.
- The vulnerable code location within `x_tables.c`.
- The fix implemented to address this issue which introduces an additional check for module ownership during table lookup in `xt_find_table_lock`.
- The fix ensures that the returned table's `me` reference matches the requested `owner`. This prevents the `module_put` from operating on a freed module.
- The commit also lists the commit that introduced the regression.
