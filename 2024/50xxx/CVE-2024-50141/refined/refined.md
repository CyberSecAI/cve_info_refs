### Content Analysis

The provided content describes a patch for a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's ACPI Platform Runtime Mechanism (PRM) driver. The vulnerability arises from incorrect memory type usage when mapping physical addresses to virtual addresses for EFI runtime services.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The PRM driver was incorrectly using memory blocks of type `EFI_CONVENTIONAL_MEMORY` instead of `EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME` for translating physical addresses to virtual addresses for EFI runtime services. According to the UEFI specification, only memory with the `EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME` attribute should be used by runtime services.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Incorrect Memory Type Usage:** The driver used the wrong memory type, leading to potential issues with address mapping.
-   **Paging Request Errors:** When a PRM handler, which is a type of runtime service, was called, it resulted in an exception due to the incorrect memory mapping, triggering a paging request error.
-   **Error Handling Failure:** If the PRM handler is called without proper memory allocation, the error handling process will fail.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   The primary impact is a failure in the execution of the PRM handler due to incorrect virtual address mapping, resulting in a paging request error and potentially leading to a system crash or undefined behavior during error handling.
-   The vulnerability can cause a "Firmware Bug" scenario when calling a PRM handler which would result in a failure during error handling, rendering the system unstable.

**Attack vectors:**

The vulnerability is triggered when the PRM driver attempts to translate physical addresses to virtual addresses for PRM handlers that are EFI runtime services. This occurs during the ACPI parsing process or during runtime when the handler is called.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

An attacker would need to trigger the ACPI Platform Runtime Mechanism handler, which is related to the Platform Runtime Mechanism functionality, by somehow forcing the system to call a PRM handler, which would be exposed via an ACPI table.

**Technical Details:**

*   The fix changes the `efi_pa_va_lookup` function in `drivers/acpi/prmt.c` to specifically look for memory blocks with the `EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME` attribute.
*   It also adds a warning message if no suitable block is found, and returns 0 to indicate failure in VA translation, which will cause error handling of a particular PRM handler.
*   The handler addresses, static data buffer address and the acpi parameter buffer addresses will only be valid if mapped in the `EFI_MEMORY_RUNTIME` type.

This patch ensures that PRM handlers and their contexts are properly mapped in the virtual address space during runtime by using the correct memory types, preventing the paging request error.
