The provided content is a security advisory from QNAP, which includes information about CVE-2024-50403.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the use of externally-controlled format string.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of format strings, allowing for the injection of format specifiers that are controlled by an external source (attacker). This means that format string specifiers can be injected by external inputs.

**Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote attackers with administrator access to either obtain secret data or modify memory on the affected device.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, requiring the attacker to have network access to the affected device and also requiring administrator-level access to it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have gained administrator access to the QNAP device remotely.
