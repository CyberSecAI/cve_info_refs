{
  "CVE-2024-50234": [
    {
      "Root cause": "A stale interrupt was not cleared before enabling interrupts during device resume, leading to a race condition between resume and restart work, causing the system to crash.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Race condition",
        "Improper interrupt handling"
      ],
      "Impact": "System crash, device malfunction, denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of events during device resume from hibernation. An attacker could trigger this by initiating a hibernation and resume cycle on a device using the affected iwlegacy driver.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger a device hibernation and resume."
    },
    {
      "Root cause": "The iwlegacy driver fails during resume from hibernation due to a stale interrupt not being cleared before enabling interrupts, causing a race between bringing the device up and down.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Stale interrupt handling",
         "Race condition during resume"
      ],
      "Impact": "Device becomes unavailable upon resume, leading to a system crash.",
      "Attack vectors": "Triggering a system resume from hibernation, particularly on systems with Intel 4965 wireless network adapters",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be in a position to trigger the system's hibernation and subsequent resume."
