{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "User input is not validated and is written to the filesystem via `ParserLabel::addLabels()`",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation, leading to arbitrary file write.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). Attackers can achieve penetration, privilege escalation, sensitive data exposure, Denial of Service, cryptomining, and ransomware deployment.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based attack.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "High privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability."
