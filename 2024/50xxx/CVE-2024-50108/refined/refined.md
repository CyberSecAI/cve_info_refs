The provided content is related to a fix for a bug causing black screens and kernel warnings when using Display Power Saving (PSR-SU) with a specific TCON (Parade 08-01) in the AMD display driver. While it is a bug fix, not a security vulnerability, it does not relate to CVE-2024-50108, as this CVE is a placeholder.

The root cause of the issue is a problem with enabling PSR-SU on Parade 08-01 TCON, which leads to black screens and kernel warnings during boot and fullscreen video playback using VA-API. The weakness is a failure to properly enable the Display Power Saving (PSR-SU) feature on the Parade 08-01 TCON. This issue was identified during testing by Stuart Hayhurst and is not due to any specific vulnerability. The impact is that the display may go black for around 1 second and kernel warning traces will be generated when the dmub_psr_enable() function is called with the specific Parade 08-01 TCON. The attack vector is through normal usage by enabling PSR-SU with the mentioned hardware. There are no special attacker capabilities required. 
The provided links [1] and [2] are for dmesg logs that show the issues occurring.

The fix disables PSR-SU for the identified TCON by adding a check to the `is_psr_su_specific_panel()` function in `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/modules/power/power_helpers.c`, which prevents PSR-SU from being enabled for that specific hardware. This fix is considered temporary until the root cause of the DMUB failure can be properly analyzed.
