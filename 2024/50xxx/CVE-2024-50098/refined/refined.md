The provided content pertains to a fix for a deadlock issue in the Linux kernel's UFS (Universal Flash Storage) driver, and is relevant to the CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A deadlock could occur during reboot if the UFS shutdown process set `SDEV_QUIESCE` for all Logical Units (LUs) while another process (like an audio driver) was waiting on `blk_mq_submit_bio()` holding a mutex lock. This could lead to a deadlock when the audio driver shutdown waited for the mutex unlock.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The use of `scsi_device_quiesce` during UFS shutdown did not properly prevent new I/O operations from being initiated, which resulted in the deadlock scenario described above.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The system would become deadlocked during a reboot operation.
- The system would become unresponsive and require a hard reset.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering a system reboot while the UFS subsystem and other drivers (such as an audio driver) are active and performing I/O operations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be in a position to trigger a reboot of the affected system.
- The attacker would need no special privileges.

**Technical Details**
- The fix replaces `scsi_device_quiesce(sdev)` with setting the device state to `SDEV_OFFLINE` using `scsi_device_set_state(sdev, SDEV_OFFLINE)` protected by a mutex. This ensures that any new I/O requests after UFS shutdown return an error, preventing the deadlock scenario. The write-once logical unit (WLUN) is excluded from this change.
- The commit messages include a kernel log showing the call trace leading to the deadlock.
