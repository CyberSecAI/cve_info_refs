Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2024-50272**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `filemap_read()` function in the Linux kernel lacks proper bounds checking. Specifically, it truncates the iterator based on the filesystem's maximum size (`inode->i_sb->s_maxbytes`) without considering the current file position (`iocb->ki_pos`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Infinite Loop:** If `iocb->ki_pos` is close to `s_maxbytes` and the iterator's count results in a value that overflows `s_maxbytes` after being added to  `iocb->ki_pos`, the `filemap_read()` function enters an infinite loop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop can lead to a denial of service, as the process becomes stuck and unable to continue execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious caller can craft an I/O request with an `iocb->ki_pos` close to the filesystem limit, and with an iterator that results in an overflow when combined with `ki_pos`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to call `filemap_read()` with carefully crafted parameters. This could be through a specially crafted application or by exploiting a different vulnerability that allows controlling I/O operations.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves truncating the iterator using `inode->i_sb->s_maxbytes - iocb->ki_pos` which accounts for the current position in the file.
- The vulnerability was discovered during testing with xfstests generic/525 using the "localio" optimization for loopback NFS mounts.
- The fix addresses a regression introduced by commit `c2a9737f45e2`
