The provided content relates to CVE-2024-50285.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The ksmbd server did not properly limit the number of simultaneous SMB operations, leading to excessive memory consumption through the "ksmbd_work_cache".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient control over the number of concurrent SMB requests being processed, allowing a client to exhaust server resources by sending many requests simultaneously.
- The existing credit mechanism was not adequate to prevent resource exhaustion from simultaneous SMB operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Out-of-memory (OOM) condition on the server, potentially leading to denial of service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a large number of simultaneous SMB requests to the ksmbd server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to connect to the ksmbd server and send SMB requests.
- No special privileges on the server are required.
