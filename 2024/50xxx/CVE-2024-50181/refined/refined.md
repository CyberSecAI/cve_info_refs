The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the i.MX7D clock driver within the Linux kernel. Specifically, it concerns the improper use of the `CLK_SET_PARENT_GATE` flag for DRAM mux clocks.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the incorrect application of the `CLK_SET_PARENT_GATE` flag when defining clock muxes related to DRAM for the i.MX7D processor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Incorrect Clock Flag:** The `CLK_SET_PARENT_GATE` flag was incorrectly applied to the DRAM mux clocks. This flag is intended for clocks where disabling the parent clock is acceptable during a clock source change.
-   **DRAM Clock Dependency:** For i.MX7D, changes to the DRAM clock source should be handled in low-level assembly code that operates outside of the DRAM memory space. The clock tree API should only be used to sync the hardware clock status and *not* to perform the source switching directly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **System Hang:** Using the `CLK_SET_PARENT_GATE` flag with the DRAM clock muxes results in the parent clock being disabled while DRAM is active. This leads to a system hang, as DRAM operation is interrupted.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Software/Driver Level:** The vulnerability resides within the Linux kernel's clock driver for i.MX7D. An attacker would need to trigger the clock source switch through the driver API, either directly or indirectly by manipulating system settings related to clocks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Kernel Access:** The attacker would need to have the ability to interact with the kernel's clock management API. This could involve having root privileges or compromising a process that has the required level of access to make changes to the clock configurations.
-   **System Specific Knowledge:** They would need specific knowledge of i.MX7D clock configuration and the associated drivers.

**Additional Notes:**

The fix for this vulnerability involves removing the `CLK_SET_PARENT_GATE` flag from the DRAM-related mux clock definitions. This forces the system to handle DRAM clock source changes correctly in low-level code. The provided patches show the removal of the `CLK_SET_PARENT_GATE` from the `imx_clk_hw_mux2_flags` function calls and replacing them with `imx_clk_hw_mux2` for the DRAM muxes.
