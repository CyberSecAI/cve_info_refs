Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command" (CWE-78), commonly known as OS command injection.
*   Multiple parameters within the "lan_apply" API are not properly sanitized. These unsanitized parameters are then concatenated into OS level commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary OS commands due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Root Access:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain complete, unrestricted root access to the affected wireless access point.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating parameters within the "lan_apply" API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the affected devices to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Products and Firmware Versions:**

*   Advantech EKI-6333AC-2G (<= v1.6.3)
*   Advantech EKI-6333AC-2GD (<= v1.6.3)
*   Advantech EKI-6333AC-1GPO (<= v1.2.1)

**CVSS Score:**

*   7.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
