# Reflected XSS ('Cross-site Scripting') in librenms/includes/functions.php

High

[murrant](/murrant)
published
GHSA-v7w9-63xh-6r3w
Nov 14, 2024

## Package

librenms/includes/functions.php
(LibreNMS)

## Affected versions

<= 24.9.1

## Patched versions

24.10.0

## Description

### Summary

A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "section" parameter of the "logs" tab of a device allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript. This vulnerability results in the execution of malicious code when a user accesses the page with a malicious "section" parameter, potentially compromising their session and enabling unauthorized actions. The issue arises from a lack of sanitization in the "report\_this()" function.

### Details

The "section" parameter of the "logs" tab is vulnerable to reflected XSS. An attacker can inject the following XSS payload into the "section" parameter:

`<script>constructor['constructor'](atob('Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p'))();<%2fscript>`

When the page is loaded with this malicious parameter, the script executes immediately. This vulnerability occurs due to the lack of sanitization in the "report\_this()" function. Other endpoints using this same function may also be vulnerable.

The vulnerable sink is located here:

[librenms/includes/functions.php](https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/7f2ae971c4a565b0d7345fa78b4211409f96800a/includes/functions.php#L523)

|  | echo report\_this('Unknown section ' . $vars['section']); |
| --- | --- |

### PoC

1. Inject the following payload into the "section" parameter of the "logs" tab:

   `<script>constructor['constructor'](atob('Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p'))();<%2fscript>`
2. Access the page with the injected payload.
3. Observe that the injected script executes when the page is loaded.

Example URL: `http://<your_url>/device/device=1/tab=logs/section=%3Cscript%3Econstructor['constructor'](atob('Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p'))();%3C%2fscript%3E/`

Example Request:

```
GET /device/device=1/tab=logs/section=%3Cscript%3Econstructor['constructor'](atob('Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p'))();%3C%2fscript%3E/ HTTP/1.1
Host: <your_host>
Cookie: <your_cookie>
```
### Impact

This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user’s session by crafting a malicious URL. The attack could lead to session hijacking, unauthorized actions, or further exploitation by injecting malicious scripts.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
