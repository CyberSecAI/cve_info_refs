  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `Request` class in symfony/http-foundation does not parse URLs with special characters the same way browsers do.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `Request` class does not handle special characters in URLs consistently with browser implementations, leading to discrepancies."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trick a validator relying on the `Request` class to redirect users to another domain (open redirect).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting URLs with special characters that are parsed differently by the `Request` class and browsers.",
       "Sending a malicious URL to a website that uses symfony/http-foundation and relying on the Request class to sanitize it."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a URL with special characters, no user interaction is required (but user interaction is needed for the resulting redirect)."
