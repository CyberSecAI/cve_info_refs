- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of multiple parameters within the `connection_profile_apply` API. These unsanitized parameters are concatenated into OS level commands, leading to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-78 "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')"
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to gain full, unrestricted root access to the wireless access point.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending crafted requests to the `connection_profile_apply` API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user of the affected device.
