  "cve": "CVE-2024-50677",
  "description": "The provided content describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in OroPlatform CMS v5.1. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the search functionality, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution.",
  "affected_product": "OroPlatform CMS v5.1",
  "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user input within the search functionality. The application directly uses the input within the search bar and renders it on the page, allowing JavaScript to execute freely.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a victim's browser session when they interact with the search functionality. This could lead to a variety of impacts, such as session hijacking, cookie stealing, defacement of the website, or redirection of the user to malicious websites.",
  "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload in the search parameter, then tricking the user to click on the URL. The javascript executes when a user interacts with the search bar, either by explicitly clicking it or when triggered through other vulnerabilities.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to craft a malicious URL with a JavaScript payload. This could be achieved by sending the link via email or other messaging services. The attacker also requires that the victim has a valid session on the target website to perform actions under their session. Chaining this with other vulnerabilities such as CSRF can force the victim to interact with the search bar without the user's direct input.",
