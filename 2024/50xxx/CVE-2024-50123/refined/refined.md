The provided content relates to CVE-2024-50123.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing `BPF_LINK_TYPE` invocation for sockmap links in the kernel's BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) subsystem. This omission leads to an out-of-bounds read in the `bpf_link_show_fdinfo()` function when handling file descriptors associated with sockmap links.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read when the kernel attempts to access information about a sockmap link file descriptor via the `bpf_link_show_fdinfo()` function.
- **Missing `BPF_LINK_TYPE` Definition:** The root cause of the out-of-bounds read is the absence of a `BPF_LINK_TYPE` definition for sockmap links, causing incorrect indexing or lookups during operations on these links.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel Information Leak:** The out-of-bounds read could lead to a leak of kernel memory contents, which might expose sensitive data or facilitate further attacks.
- **Denial of Service:** While not explicitly mentioned, repeated triggering of the out-of-bounds read could lead to crashes or instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by interacting with a sockmap link file descriptor, which likely involves operations that call `bpf_link_show_fdinfo()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to interact with the BPF subsystem and specifically manipulate sockmap links. This typically requires some level of privilege or the ability to execute BPF programs within the kernel context.
