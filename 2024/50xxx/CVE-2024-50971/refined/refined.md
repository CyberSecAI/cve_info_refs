Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-50971

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `print.php` file of the Itsourcecode Construction Management System v1.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `map_id` parameter in `print.php`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
- **Data Breach:** Potential for sensitive data exfiltration and modification.
- **Database Manipulation:** Attackers can potentially modify, delete, or add data to the database, potentially leading to application malfunction or complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `print.php` file.
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The malicious SQL payload is injected via the `map_id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax to craft malicious payloads.
- **Ability to send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to construct and send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **No Authentication Required For Initial Injection:** The provided attack vector does not show any requirements to authenticate to perform an initial time-based injection test. However, exploitation may require authentication and session management (cookie) if the attacker wants to dump the database using tools like SQLMap.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content includes steps on how to replicate the vulnerability using a time-based SQL injection and further exploitation using sqlmap.
- The application affected is the Itsourcecode Construction Management System version 1.0.
- The vulnerable parameter is map_id.
