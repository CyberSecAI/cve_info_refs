Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-50942:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `qiwen-file` application, specifically due to insufficient input sanitization when handling the `title` parameter in the `/notice/list` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application directly uses the provided `title` parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not filter or validate the user-supplied input before incorporating it into the SQL query.
*   **Direct DTO usage:** The service layer directly uses the Data Transfer Object (DTO) as query parameters, relying on MyBatis for automatic field mapping, without implementing filtering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., database name, data from other tables) by crafting malicious SQL queries.
*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data modification, deletion, or even complete system compromise. In the provided case, a table was created.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable through the `/notice/list` endpoint.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via an HTTP GET request with a crafted `title` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected server hosting the `qiwen-file` application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL to craft the malicious injection payloads.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Based on the provided information, the described exploit doesn't appear to require any prior authentication.

**Technical Details from Content:**

*   **Affected Product:** `qiwen-file` <= v1.4.0
*   **Affected Component:** `src/main/resources/mapper/NoticeMapper.xml`
*   **Attack Endpoint:** `/notice/list`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `title`
*   **Example Payloads:**
    *   Time-based blind SQL injection payload: `')/\*\*/AS/\*\*/total/\*\*/UNION /\*\*/(SELECT/\*\*/5211/\*\*/FROM/\*\*/(SELECT/\*\*/IF(SUBSTRING(DATABASE(),1,1)='f',SLEEP(5),0))/\*\*/AS/\*\*/delay);`
    *   Example payload to create a table: `')as/\*\*/total/\*\*/union/\*\*/select/\*\*/database();create/\*\*/table/\*\*/test(birthdate/\*\*/DATE);--%20`
*   **Manual Testing:** SQL Injection was tested manually after automated tools failed.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Time-based blind SQL injection was used due to the lack of direct output of the executed queries.
*   **Debugging:** Enabling debug logs helped with identifying the SQL injection.
