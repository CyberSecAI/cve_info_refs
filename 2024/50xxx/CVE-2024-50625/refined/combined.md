Jun 14, 2021
###### **FragAttacks - WiFi Fregmentation and Aggregation Attacks**

At this time, Digi is still reviewing these attacks and how they impact our devices. From the nature of the attacks, we do expect that Digi devices will be impacted.

However, it is critical to note that even with these attacks, it has always been DIgi's policy and suggestions that network communication should never rely on the protections and standards of the data layers (WiFi/BlueTooth). Many of these are implemented in HW and can be difficult to change. If good network practices are used, (TLS/Certificates etc), then these vulnerabilities do not lead to any real impact. These vulnerabilites can only become impactful IF other flaws or issues are present.

It is Digi's intent to address these issues so that we preserve our defense in depth strategy to security in our products. Due to the complexity of these issues, we believe we will be able to address these by Q4 of 2021 or sooner if possible.

Jun 16, 2020
###### **RIPPLE20 - Multiple vulnerabilities in TRECK TCP/IP embedded software - VU#257161**

A number of high level vulnerabilities (CVE's) that affect the TCP/IP internal stack processing have been identified. Digi has been working with customers since February to install firmware updates to address the issue. Under specific circumstances, it may be possible that these vulnerabilities could lead to a remote code execution via a network based attack without authentication.

Jun 02, 2020
###### **Reflection attack WR11,WR21,WR31,WR41,WR44 series routers - VU#636397 - CVE-2020-10136**

A high level vulnerability (CVSS => 7.0) was discovered on the Digi WR11,WR21,WR31,WR41, and WR44 cellular routers. The attack allows IP-in-IP encapsulation to be used to route arbitrary network traffic through a vulnerable device.

Please download firmware V8.1.0.1 (or greater) for a fix for this issue. Alternatively, enabling the firewall feature on the devices WAN interface (or cellular interface) port will also mitigate this attack.

For more information on this vulnerability, please see the knowledge base article within the Digi support section

Important safety information

Important safety information

To avoid contact with electrical current:

n Never install electrical wiring during an electrical storm.

n Never install an Ethernet connection in wet locations unless that connector is

specifically designed for wet locations.

n Use caution when installing or modifying lines.

n Use a screwdriver and other tools with insulated handles.

n Wear safety glasses or goggles.

n Do not place Ethernet wiring or connections in any conduit, outlet or junction box

containing electrical wiring.

n Installation of inside wire may bring you close to electrical wire, conduit,

terminals and other electrical facilities. Extreme caution must be used to avoid

electrical shock from such facilities. Avoid contact with all such facilities.

n Ethernet wiring must be at least 6 feet from bare power wiring or lightning rods

and associated wires, and at least 6 inches from other wire (antenna wires,

doorbell wires, wires from transformers to neon signs), steam or hot water pipes,

and heating ducts.

n Do not place an Ethernet connection where it would allow a person to use an

Ethernet device while in a bathtub, shower, swimming pool, or similar hazardous

location.

n Protectors and grounding wire placed by the service provider must not be

connected to, removed, or modified by the customer.

n Do not touch uninsulated Ethernet wiring if lightning is likely.

n External wiring: Any external communications wiring installed needs to be

constructed to all relevant electrical codes. In the United States this is the

National Electrical Code Article 800. Contact a licensed electrician for details.

ConnectPort LTS features

Serial data communication over TCP and UDP

n Serial data communication over TCP can automatically perform the following functions:

l Establish bi-directional TCP connections, known as autoconnections, between the serial

device and a server or other network device. Autoconnections are based on data and/or

serial hardware signals.

l Control forwarding characteristics based on size, time, and pattern.

l Allow incoming raw, telnet, and SSL/TLS (secure-socket) connections.

n Serial data communication over UDP can automatically perform the following functions:

l Digi Connect products can automatically send serial data to one or more devices or

systems on the network using UDP sockets. Options for sending data include whether

specific data is on the serial line, a specific time period has elapsed, or after the specified

number of bytes has been received on the serial port.

l Control forwarding characteristics based on size, time, and patterns.

l Support incoming datagrams from multiple destinations.

l Support outgoing datagrams sent to multiple destinations.

n TCP/UDP forwarding characteristics.

n Extended communication control on TCP/UDP data paths.

l Timeout

l Hangup

l User-configurable Socket ID string (text string identifier on autoconnect only)

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
You can use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to automatically assign IP addresses, deliver
IP stack configuration parameters such as the subnet mask and default router, and provide other
configuration information. For more details, see Assign an IP address using DHCP.

Auto IP
The Auto-IP protocol automatically assigns an IP address from a reserved pool of standard Auto-IP
addresses to the computer on which it is installed. Digi devices automatically obtain their IP
addresses from a DHCP server. If the DHCP server is unavailable or nonexistent, Auto-IP assigns the
device an IP address. For more details, see Assign an IP address using Auto-IP.

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a protocol for managing and monitoring network
devices. SNMP architecture enables a network administrator to manage nodes—servers,
workstations, routers, switches, hubs, and so on—on an IP network; manage network performance,
find and solve network problems, and plan for network growth. For more information on SNMP as a
device-management interface, see Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides authentication and encryption for
ConnectPort LTS products. For more information, see Security features in Digi devices.

n Messages received

n Bad messages received

n Destination unreachable messages received

Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) transports multi-protocol packets over point-to-point links. PPP is
responsible for:

n Encapsulating the data packet

n Allowing the server to inform the dial-up client of its IP address (or client to request the IP

address)

n Authenticating the exchange

n Negotiating multiple protocols

n Reassembling the data packet for network communication

ConnectPort LTS features

RealPort software

Advanced Digi Discovery Protocol (ADDP)
The ADDP runs on any operating system capable of sending multicast IP packets on a network. ADDP
allows the system to identify all ADDP-enabled ConnectPort LTS products attached to a network by
sending out a multicast packet. The ConnectPort LTS products respond to the multicast packet and
identify themselves to the client sending the multicast.

ADDP communicates with the IP stack using UDP. The IP stack can receive multicast packets and
transmit datagrams on a network.

You can enable or disable access to ADDP service, but you cannot change the network port number for
ADDP from its default.

Secure Shell (SSH)
ConnectPort LTS products support Secure Shell (SSH) as a connection method and the following types
of SSH connections: Reverse SSH and SSH Autoconnect. Limited use of SSH via SSH client is available
from the Linux command line/bash shell. For more information on these connections, see Network
connections and data paths. You can enable or disable access to Secure Shell network services.

RealPort software

Digi’s RealPort software leverages the TCP/IP network infrastructure to provide a virtual connection
to serial devices. The software is installed directly on the server and allows applications to talk to
devices via a Digi device server or terminal server over a network.

RealPort software is a COM port redirector that allows multiple connections to multiple ports over a
single TCP/IP connection. This means RealPort supports the maximum number of remote devices. The
number is restricted only by the operating system and server processing power.

Other unique features include full hardware and software flow control, as well as tunable latency and
throughput. With these, RealPort ensures optimum performance since data transfer is adjusted
according to specific application requirements. It also provides connection recovery—after a network
interruption RealPort automatically reconnects the device to the COM port without the application
knowing there was a failure.

Encrypted RealPort

ConnectPort LTS devices also support RealPort software with encryption. Encrypted RealPort offers a
secure Ethernet connection between the COM or TTY port and a device server or terminal server.
Encryption prevents internal and external snooping of data across the network by encapsulating the
TCP/IP packets in an SSL connection and encrypting the data using Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES).

Digi’s RealPort with encryption driver has earned Microsoft’s Windows Hardware Quality Lab (WHQL)
certification.

Drivers are available for a wide range of operating systems, including Microsoft Windows and Linux x32
and x64 based operating systems, as well as other versions of Unix. See the RealPort Compatibility OS
List in the Digi Knowledge Base for a detailed list of supported operating systems. It is ideal for
financial, retail/point-of-sale, government, or any application requiring enhanced security to protect
sensitive information.

Alarms

Alarms

You can configure ConnectPort LTS products to issue alarms, in the form of email messages or SNMP
traps, when certain device events occur, including data patterns detected in the data stream

Configuring Digi devices to issue alarms allows you to know when events occur. For more information
on configuring alarms, see Alarms Configuration.

Modem emulation

ConnectPort LTS devices include a configuration profile that allows the device to emulate a modem.
Modem emulation sends and receives modem responses to a serial device over TCP/IP (including
Ethernet) instead of Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The modem emulation profile allows
you to maintain a current software application but using it over the less expensive Ethernet network.
In addition, you can enable or disable telnet processing on the incoming and outgoing modem-
emulation connections. For information on the modem-emulation commands that ConnectPort LTS
products support, see the Digi Connect® Family Command Reference. See Select Port Profile for more
information.

Ethernet bridging

You can use Ethernet bridging to join multiple Ethernet networks together so that the joined
networks appear as one Ethernet network. Ethernet bridging combines an Ethernet interface with
one or more physical Ethernet interfaces under the umbrella of a single bridge interface. The Ethernet
bridge is a software switch that can connect multiple Ethernet interfaces (physical or virtual) on a
single machine while sharing a single IP subnet.

Use the script file, brmode (/etc/init.d/brmode), to enable or disable Ethernet bridging. (Ethernet
bridging is supported only through the command line interface.)

To enable Ethernet bridging, run the following command:

# service brmode start

The IP address of the eth0 interface becomes the common IP address for the bridging mode interface
(br0).

After enabling Ethernet bridging, the eth0 and eth1 addresses disappear. There is a delay of a few
minutes while the system automatically changes the physical interface from the Ethernet 1 port to
Ethernet 2 port.

Note Enable the eth1 (IP address #2) interface before starting Ethernet bridging.

To disable Ethernet bridging, run the following command:

# service brmode stop

To customize Ethernet bridging options, modify /etc/init.d/brmode. See the brctl Linux manpage for
details.

To remove bridging messages from the serial console, run the following command:

# brctl setageing br0 0

Configure IP addresses

The IP address mode determines how IP addresses are assigned. There are two modes for assigning
IP addresses:

n Dynamic: Allows IP addresses to be automatically assigned using the Dynamic Host

Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and/or Auto Private IP Addressing (APIP or AUTO IP).

n Static: Requires you to assign a static IP address using any available configuration interface.

By default, ConnectPort LTS devices are configured to dynamically assign addresses using DHCP.

Even if a DHCP server is available for dynamically assigning IP addresses, static addresses may work
better for your network configuration. Once set, static IP addresses do not change and other network
devices can always find the device by its IP address. With dynamic settings, the DHCP server can

Digi ConnectPort LTS User Guide

Configure IP addresses

change the IP address frequently or infrequently depending on how your network administrator has
configured the network.

When the IP address changes, network devices configured to talk to the ConnectPort LTS device can
no longer access the device. In this case, you must locate the Digi device using the Digi Device
Discovery utility and reconfigure the other network devices that need to communicate with the
ConnectPort LTS device.

The following table summarizes methods for assigning an IP address.

Method

Description

Digi Device
Discovery
Utility

LCD panel

Use the Digi Device Discovery utility to search for and display Digi device, as well as
change configuration settings. See Use Digi Device Discovery utility to sign in to
the web interface.

Use the LCD panel on ConnectPort LTS products to perform basic configuration
tasks, including setting the IP address, as well as monitoring and diagnostics
tasks. See ConnectPort LTS LCD interface.

Dynamic Host
Configuration
Protocol
(DHCP)

Use DHCP from the web interface to automatically assign IP addresses, to deliver
IP stack configuration parameters such as the subnet mask and default router,
and to provide other configuration information. All ConnectPort LTS devices have a
DHCP client enabled by default. Contact your network administrator to find out if a
DHCP server is available. See Assign an IP address using DHCP.

Auto Private IP
Addressing
(APIPA)
also known as
Auto-IP

Static IP

Use APIPA to automatically assign an IP address to the Digi device from a reserved
pool of standard Auto-IP addresses on a DHCP server. If the DHCP server is
unavailable or there is no DHCP server, Auto-IP assigns the device an IP address. If
DHCP is enabled or responds after ADDP is used, both override the Auto-IP
address previously assigned. See Assign an IP address using Auto-IP.

Manually assign a specific IP address to a device through the Digi Device Discovery
Utility, the web interface, LCD, or the command-line interface. Once set, these
settings do not change. The IP address and subnet mask are mandatory.
Additional settings may be needed for some functions. Contact your network
administrator for the required values.

Access via the
console port

Use the port, labeled console port on ConnectPort LTS device to configure device
settings. This port allows for a login with serial settings of 9600 baud, 8 data bits,
and 1 stop bit. The standard serial ports do not provide a login by default and do
not provide access to configuration settings. Only the console port allows access
to configuration settings.

Command-line
interface

Use the command-line interface to configure device settings. See Assign an IP
address from the command-line interface.

Assign an IP address using DHCP
You can assign an IP address using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). DHCP is an Internet
protocol for automating the configuration of computers that use IP. You can use DHCP to
automatically assign IP addresses and deliver IP stack configuration parameters.

The following procedure assumes that you configured the Digi device as a DHCP client. The Digi
devices discussed in this document are configured as a DHCP client by default.

To configure an IP address using DHCP:

Digi ConnectPort LTS User Guide

25

Get started with ConnectPort LTS products

Configure IP addresses

1. Verify the Digi device is not powered on.

2.

If desired, set up a permanent entry for the Digi device on a DHCP server. While this is not

necessary to obtain an IP address via DHCP, setting up a permanent entry saves the IP

address after the device is rebooted.

3. Connect the Digi device to the network and power it on. DHCP assigns the IP address

configured in step 2 automatically.

Assign an IP address using Auto-IP
The standard Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA or Auto-IP) protocol automatically assigns the
IP address from a group of reserved IP addresses to the device on which Auto-IP is installed. Use Digi
Device Discovery or ADDP to find the Digi device and assign it a new IP address that is compatible with
your network. When you plug in the device, Auto-IP automatically assigns the IP address. Auto-IP
addresses are typically in the 169.254.x.x address range. See Use Digi Device Discovery utility to sign in
to the web interface for instructions on using Digi Device Discovery.

Assign an IP address from the command-line interface
Use the set network command to configure an IP address from the command line. The set network
command includes the following parameters:

n index=(1-4): The Ethernet interface index number.

n ip_v4=device ip: The IP address for the device.

n gateway_v4=gateway: The network gateway IP v4 address.

n garp=seconds: The frequency of Gratuitous ARP (GARP) announcements, in seconds, which are

a broadcast announcement to the network of a device’s MAC address and the IP address.

n submask_v4=device submask: The device subnet mask for the IP v4 address.

n mode_v4=(none|static|dhcp): The configuration mode of the IP v4 address.

n ip_v6=device ip: The IP v6 address for the device.

n gateway_v6=gateway: The IP address for the IP v6 network gateway.

n submask_v6=gateway: The device subnet mask for the IP v6 address.

n mode+v6=(none|static|dhcp): The configuration mode of the IP v6 address.

For example:

set network index=1 ip_v4=10.0.0.100 gateway_v4=10.0.0.1 submask_v4=255.255.255.0 mode_
v4=static

Network connections and data paths

ConnectPort LTS devices allow for several kinds of connections and paths for data flow between
ConnectPort LTS devices and other entities. You can group these connections into two main
categories:

n Network services, in which a remote entity initiates a connection to a Digi device.

n Network/serial clients, in which a Digi device initiates a network connection or opens a serial

port for communication.

The following topics describe the effects of enabling features and selecting settings when configuring
ConnectPort LTS devices.

Network services

A network service connection occurs when a remote entity initiates a connection to a Digi device.
There are several categories of network services:

n Network services associated with specific ports

n Network services associated with serial ports in general

n Network services associated with the command-line interface

Network services associated with specific ports
The following list details network services associated with specific ports.

n Reverse telnet: A remote entity establishes a telnet connection to a Digi serial port. Data

passes transparently between the telnet connection and a named serial port.

n Reverse raw socket: A remote entity establishes a raw TCP socket connection to a Digi serial

port. Data passes transparently between the socket and a named serial port.

n Reverse TLS socket: A remote entity establishes an encrypted raw TCP socket connection to a

Digi serial port. Data passes transparently to and from a named serial port.

n LPD: A remote entity establishes a TCP connection to a named serial port. The Digi device

interprets the LPD protocol and sends a print job out of the serial port.

n Modem emulation, also known as pseudo-modem (pmodem): A remote entity establishes a

TCP connection to a named serial port. This connection is “interpreted” as an incoming call to

the pseudo-modem.

n Console Mgmt: Allows a TCP connection to a serially-attached console.

Digi ConnectPort LTS User Guide

35

Network connections and data paths

Network/serial clients

n Modem: The Modem Profile allows you to attach modem devices to the serial port to establish

or receive connections from other systems and modems. Both the modem dial-in and bi-

directional options provide a login from the Digi device.

n Reverse SSH: A remote entity establishes an SSH connection to a ConnectPort LTS serial port

and data passes transparently between the SSH connection and a named serial port.

Network services associated with serial ports in general
The following list details network services associated with serial ports in general.

n RealPort: A single TCP connection manages (potentially) multiple serial ports.

n Modem emulation, also known as pseudo-modem (pool): A TCP connection to the “pool” port

is interpreted as an incoming call to an available pseudo-modem in the “pool” of available port

numbers.

n rsh: ConnectPort LTS products support a limited implementation of the remote shell (rsh)

protocol, in that a single service listens to connections and allows a command to be executed.

Only one class of commands is allowed: a single integer that specifies which serial port to

connect to. Otherwise, the resulting connection is somewhat similar to a reverse telnet or

reverse socket connection.

Network services associated with the command-line interface
The following list details network services associated with the command line interface (CLI).

n SSH: Use Secure Shell (SSH) to directly access a ConnectPort LTS command-line interface.

n Telnet: Use telnet to directly access a ConnectPort LTS command-line interface.

n Rlogin: Perform a remote login (rlogin) to a ConnectPort LTS command-line interface.

Network/serial clients

A network/serial client connection occurs when a ConnectPort LTS product initiates a network
connection or opens a serial port for communication. There are several categories of network/serial
client connections:

n Autoconnect behavior client connections

n Command-line interface (CLI)-based client connections

n Modem emulation (pseudo-modem) client connections

Autoconnect behavior client connections
In client connections that involve autoconnect behaviors, a ConnectPort LTS product initiates a
network connection based on timing, serial activity, or serial modem signals. Autoconnect-related
client connections include:

n Raw TCP connection: The ConnectPort LTS initiates a raw TCP socket connection to a remote

entity.

Digi ConnectPort LTS User Guide

36

Network connections and data paths

Network/serial clients

n Telnet connection: The ConnectPort LTS initiates a TCP connection using the telnet protocol

to a remote entity.

n SSH connection: The ConnectPort LTS initiates a TCP connection using the SSH protocol to a

remote entity.

n Raw TLS encrypted connection: The ConnectPort LTS initiates an encrypted raw TCP socket

connection to a remote entity.

n Rlogin connection: The ConnectPort LTS initiates a TCP connection using the rlogin protocol

to a remote entity.

Command-line interface (CLI)-based client connections
CLI-based client connections are available for use when you establish a session with the ConnectPort
LTS product’s CLI. CLI-based client connections include:

n ssh: Allows you to connect to a remote entity using the ssh protocol.

n telnet: Allows you to connect to a remote entity using the telnet protocol.

n rlogin: Allows you to connect to remote entity using the rlogin protocol (bash only).

n scp: Allows you to transfer files (bash only).

n connect: Begin communicating with a local serial port.

Note Additional communication methods include using a bash shell such as scp, tftp, nc, or using
Python.

Modem emulation (pseudo-modem) client connections
When a port is in the modem-emulation or pseudo-modem mode, it can initiate network connections
based on AT command strings received on the serial port. See the Digi Connect® Family Command
Reference on www.digi.com for modem emulation AT commands.

Digi Device Discovery utility

The Digi Device Discovery utility:

n Locates Digi devices on a network

n Allows you to open the web interface for discovered devices

n Allows you to configure network settings and reboot the device

Download the Digi Device Discovery utility.

In addition to quickly locating devices, the utility also lists device information, such as the device
address, firmware version, and whether it has been configured. It runs on any operating system that
can send multicast IP packets to a network. It sends out a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) multicast
packet to all Digi devices on the network. Digi devices that support ADDP reply to the UDP multicast
with their configuration information. Even Digi devices that do not yet have an assigned IP address or
are misconfigured for the subnet can reply to the UDP multicast packet and appear in the device
discovery results.

Note Personal firewalls, Virtual Private Network (VPN) software, and certain network equipment can
block device discovery. Firewalls block UDP ports 2362 and 2363 that ADDP uses to discover devices.
You can enable or disable access to the ADDP service, but you cannot change the network port
number for ADDP.

Basic Network Services Settings
The Basic Network Services Settings page shows a set of common network services that are available
for ConnectPort LTS products, and the network port on which the service is running.

You can enable and disable common network services and configure the TCP/UDP port on which the
network service listens. You can disable services as needed for security purposes. That is, you can
disable certain services so the device runs only those services specifically needed. To improve device
security, you can disable non-secure services such as telnet.

Best practice Use the default network port numbers for basic network services because the port
numbers are used by most applications.

CAUTION! Exercise caution when enabling and disabling network services, particularly
disabling them. Changing certain settings can render a Digi Connect device inaccessible.
For example, disabling Advanced Digi Discovery Protocol (ADDP) prevents a network
from discovering the device, even if it is actually connected. Disabling HTTP and HTTPS
disables access to the web interface. Disabling basic services such as telnet, rlogin, and
so on makes the Command-Line interface inaccessible.

Supported basic network services and their default port numbers
For Digi devices with multiple serial ports, the network port number defaults for various services are
set based on the following formula:

basenetworkportnumber+ serialportnumber

Digi ConnectPort LTS User Guide

49

Using the ConnectPort LTS web interface

Configure the device using the web interface

The assumed default base is 2000. For example, the telnet passthrough service is set to network port
2001 for serial port 1, 2002 for serial port 2, and 2003 for serial port 3, and so on.

If you change a network port for a particular service, that is the only network port number that
changes. That change does not carry over to the other network ports. For example, if you change the
network port number for telnet passthrough from 2001 to 3001, that does not mean that the other
network ports changes to 3002, 3003, and so on.

There are two types of network services available:

n Basic services: You can access these services by connecting to a particular well-known

network port.

n Passthrough services: You can set up a specific type of service for a specific serial port. To use

the service, you must use the correct protocol and specify the correct network port. For

example, assuming default service ports and using a Linux host, here is how a user would

access the SSH and telnet passthrough services on port 1:

#> ssh -l fred digi16 -p 2501

#> telnet digi16 2101

The following table shows the network services, services provided, and the default network port
number for each service.

Socket tunnel settings
You can use a socket tunnel to connect two network devices: one on the ConnectPort LTS product’s
local network and the other on the remote network. This is especially useful for providing SSL data
protection when the local devices do not support the SSL protocol.

One of the endpoint devices is configured to initiate the socket tunnel. The tunnel is initiated when
that device opens a TCP socket to the ConnectPort LTS product on the configured port number. The
ConnectPort LTS product then opens a separate connection to the specified destination host. Once
the tunnel is established, the ConnectPort LTS product acts as a proxy for bi-directional data between
the remote network socket and the local network socket, regardless of which end initiated the
tunnel.

Socket tunnel settings include:

n Enable: Enables or disables the configured socket tunnel.

n Timeout (seconds): The timeout, specified in seconds, controls how long the tunnel will

remain connected when there is no tunnel traffic. If the timeout value is zero, then no timeout

is in effect and the tunnel will stay up until some other event causes it to close.

n Initiating Host: The hostname or IP address of the network device which will initiate the

tunnel. This field is optional.

n Initiating Port: Specify the port number that the Digi device product will use to listen for the

initial tunnel connection.

n Initiating Protocol: The protocol used between the device that initiates the tunnel and the

Digi device server. Currently, TCP and SSL are the two supported protocols.

n Destination Host: The hostname or IP address of the destination network device.

n Destination Port: The port number that the Digi device will use to make a connection to the

destination device.

n Destination Protocol: The protocol used between Digi device and the destination device.

Currently, TCP and SSL are the two supported protocols. This protocol does not need to be the

same for both connections.

n Click Add to add a socket tunnel. Click Apply to save the settings. Once the socket tunnel is

configured, select the Enable check box to enable the socket tunnel.

Advanced Network Settings
The Advanced Network Settings define the network interface. These settings rarely need to be
changed. Contact your network administrator for more information about these settings.

n IP Settings:

l Host name: The host name that will appear the DHCP Option 12 field. The host name can

be a single name or a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). You can use this optional setting

only when you enable DHCP.

Note If you change the host name, you must sign in to the web interface again.

l Enable Auto IP address assignment: Auto Private IP Addressing (APIPA), also known as

Auto-IP: A standard protocol that automatically assigns an IP address from a reserved pool

of standard Auto-IP addresses to the computer on which it is installed. The device is set to

obtain its IP address automatically from a DHCP server. If the DHCP server is unavailable

or nonexistent, Auto-IP assigns the device an IP address if one of the following instances

are true:

o You enabled DHCP or it responds later

o You are using ADDP/Device Discovery

Both will override the previously assigned Auto-IP address.

l Reuse old IP at bootup time on DHCP failure: If the Digi device fails to receive an IP

address from the DHCP server on booting up, the users can set the IP configurations of the

Digi device with the previous IP configurations and connect it to the network.

n Ethernet interface: You can set the speed and duplex mode of each Ethernet interface.

l Speed: Specify the Ethernet speed of the Digi device. Your options are as follows: Auto, 10

Mbit, 100 Mbps, or 1000 Mbps.

l Mode: Specify the duplex mode of the Ethernet interface. Your options are as follows: Auto,

Half-duplex, or Full-duplex. Note that you cannot manually set the duplex mode if the

speed is set to Auto.

n TCP keep-alive settings: The DHCP server assigns these network settings, unless you

manually set them here.

l

Idle Timeout: The period of time that a TCP connection can remain idle before sending a

keep-alive.

l Probe Interval: The time in seconds between each keep-alive probe.

l Probe Count: The number of times TCP probes the connection to determine if it is alive

after activating the keep-alive option. The connection is assumed to be lost after sending

this number of keep-alive probes.

IP filtering settings
Some Digi devices support built-in firewall functionality to limit TCP/IP traffic to and from certain
networks, TCP ports, and interfaces. The functionality implemented is based on the iptables tool.

You can restrict your Digi device on the network by only allowing certain devices or networks to
connect. This is better known as IP Filtering or Access Control Lists (ACL). By enabling IP filtering, you
are telling the Digi device to only accept connections from specific and known IP addresses or

networks. You can filter devices on a single IP address or restrict device to a group of devices using a
subnet mask that only allows specific networks to access to the device.

CAUTION! Plan and review your IP filtering settings before applying them. If the settings
are incorrect, the Digi device will be inaccessible from the network.

The settings for IP Filtering Settings include:

n Interface: The name of the network interface where the packet originated.

n Option: Determines the rule that will be applied to the specified IP address/mask or its

inverse.

n IP address/Mask: Specifies the host range by entering the base host IP address followed by a

forward slash (/) and subnet mask.

n Protocol: The type of protocol this port will accept or drop.

n Port: A TCP/IP port on the Digi device that other hosts will access.

n Chain: Determines whether or not hosts can access the port.

Serial ports configuration
Use the Serial Ports Configuration page to establish a port profile for each serial port on the
ConnectPort LTS product. The Serial Ports Configuration page includes the currently selected port
profile for the serial port, detailed configuration settings for the serial port, dependent on the port
profile selected, and links to basic and advanced serial settings.

The Serial Port Configuration page includes:

n Port Group Settings: This pane allows you to create one or more port groups and assign ports

to each port group. See Port Group Settings for more information.

n Port Settings: This pane lists the available ports and allows you to configure or copy selected

ports. See Port Settings for more information.

Port Group Settings
You can create port groups to send data to multiple ports. Instead of sending data to individual serial
ports, you can send data to all ports in a group simultaneously through a port in a group. If you select
an additional option, you can also see the data from multiple ports in the same group from a terminal
connected to the one of serial ports in the group.

To configure a port group, you must create a port group first and then select ports to be associated
with this group. You can create a maximum number of 16 port groups and a port cannot be associated
with multiple groups. When you select ports to be associated with a group you can also configure
following settings:

n No.: The group number.

n Group name: The name of the group.

n Ports: Lists the ports associated with the group.

n Console Management: Manage a serial device's console port over a network connection. The

Console Management profile allows you to access a Digi device's console port over a network

connection. Most network devices such as routers, switches, and servers offer one or more

serial ports for management. Instead of connecting a terminal to the console port, cable the

console port to the serial port of the ConnectPort LTS product. Then using TCP/IP utilities like

reverse telnet, network administrators can access these consoled serial ports from the LAN.

See Assign a profile to a serial port for more information.

n Custom: The Custom profile is an advanced option to allow full configuration of the serial port.

Use the Custom profile only if the serial port does not fit into any of the predefined port

profiles. For example, when network connections involve a mix of TCP and UDP sockets. In

ConnectPort LTS, the Custom profile also allows the access of a serial port through RealPort

protocol. See Assign a profile to a serial port for more information.

n Local Configuration: The Local Configuration profile allows you to sign in and access the

command line interface when connecting directly to a serial port on a Digi device. This profile

provides a login from the Digi device. See Assign a profile to a serial port for more information.

n Modem: The Modem profile allows you to attach modem devices to the serial port to establish

or receive connections from other systems and modems.

Modem dial-in and bi-directional options provide a login from the Digi device. See Assign a

profile to a serial port for more information.

n Modem Emulation: The Modem Emulation profile allows you to configure the serial port to act

as a modem. The Digi device server emulates modem responses to a serial device and

seamlessly sends and receives data over an Ethernet network instead of a PSTN (Public

Switched Telephone Network). This allows you to retain legacy software applications without

modification and use a less expensive Ethernet network in place of public telephone lines. See

Assign a profile to a serial port for more information.

n PPP: The PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) profile configures an Internet PPP connection so the

provider's server can respond to your requests, pass them on to the Internet, and forward

requested Internet responses back to you. PPP uses the Internet protocol (IP) (and can handle

others). Essentially, it packages your computer's TCP/IP packets and forwards them to the

server where they are put on the Internet.

n Printer: The Printer profile allows you to connect a printer to the serial port. Use this profile if

you intend to print using the LPD protocol on your system. See Assign a profile to a serial port

for more information.

n RealPort: Use RealPort to map a COM or TTY port to this serial port of your Digi device. The

COM/TTY port appears and behaves as a local port to the PC or server. RealPort is also known

as COM Port Redirection. See Assign a profile to a serial port for more information. Refer to

Install RealPort software for basic RealPort installation instructions. Refer to RealPort

Installation User's Guide for more detailed instructions on installing and configuring the RealPort

driver on your PC or server.

When you configure a RealPort profile, the ConnectPort LTS product relinquishes control of the

serial port to the host that has the RealPort driver installed. The computer applications send

data to this virtual COM or TTY port and the RealPort driver sends the data across the network

to the corresponding serial port on the ConnectPort LTS product.

The network is transparent to both the application and the serial device.

Important Install and configure the RealPort software on each computer that uses RealPort

ports. See Assign a profile to a serial port for installation instructions. You need to configure the

RealPort software with the IP address of the ConnectPort LTS product.

n Serial Bridge: The Serial Bridge Profile configures one side of a serial bridge. A bridge connects

two serial devices over the network as if they were connected with a serial cable. This is also

referred to as serial tunneling. Each serial device is connected to the serial port of a Digi device

server. You must configure one Digi device as the client and the other Digi device as the server.

This profile configures each side of the bridge separately.

See Assign a profile to a serial port for more information.

n TCP Sockets: Auto-Connect (TCP client) to another host on the network or allow incoming

connections on this serial port (TCP server). The TCP Sockets profile allows serial devices to

communicate over a TCP network. The TCP server allows other network devices to initiate a

TCP connection to the serial device attached to the serial port of the ConnectPort LTS product.

The TCP client will establish a TCP connection to a defined IP address and port number.

For more information about the TCP Sockets, see the following:

n UDP Sockets: Allows the automatic distribution of serial data from one host to many devices at

the same time. The UDP Sockets profile allows serial devices to communicate using UDP. The

UDP Server configuration allows the serial port to receive data from one or more systems or

devices on the network. See Assign a profile to a serial port for more information.

The UDP Client configuration allows the automatic distribution of serial data from one host to

many devices at the same time using UDP sockets.

The port numbering conventions shown in the TCP Sockets Profile also apply to UDP sockets.

Not all port profiles are supported in all products. Supported port profiles varies by ConnectPort LTS
model. If a profile listed in this description is not available on the page, it is not supported in the
ConnectPort LTS product.

If you selected a port profile, the port number associated with the port profile appears at the top of
the page. You can change or retain the profile and adjust individual settings.

Automatic TCP connections (Automatic Connection)

The TCP Client allows the ConnectPort LTS product to automatically establish a TCP connection to an
application or a network, known as autoconnection. You can enable autoconnection through the TCP
Sockets profile’s setting labeled Automatically establish TCP connections.

TCP and UDP network port numbering conventions

Digi devices use the following conventions for TCP and UDP network port numbering:

For this connection type...

Telnet to the serial port
The format for this port number is as follows:

Use this Port

2001 (TCP only)

20<serial port number>

Replace <serial port number> with the Digi serial
port number. For example, 2001 applies to serial
port 1, 2010 applies to serial port 10, and 2016
applies to serial port 16.

Raw connection to the serial port
The format for this port number is as follows:

2101 (TCP and UDP)

21<serial port number>

Replace <serial port number> with the Digi serial
port number. For example, 2101 applies to serial
port 1, 2110 applies to serial port 10, and 2116
applies to serial port 16.

The application or ConnectPort LTS device that initiates communication must use these network
ports numbers. If you cannot configure the application or ConnectPort LTS product to use these
network port numbers, change the network port on the ConnectPort LTS product.

Users
You can configure the Digi device server to accommodate the requirements of specific users. You can
configure the following user attributes:
n The user's name and password.

n The device interfaces that the user can access, such as the command-line interface or web

interface.

n The permissions the user has to access and configure the device.

Multi-user model implemented in ConnectPort LTS
The user model in ConnectPort LTS device determines the commands that users can issue.
ConnectPort LTS supports multiple users. ConnectPort LTS devices use a more-than-two-user model.
You can define up to 32 users. Characteristics of this model include:

n The root user is a user name or account that by default has access to all configuration settings

on the Digi device. The root user is responsible for system administration. By default, the all

permissions for the root user are enabled and the root user can issue all commands. The root

user is the first user to access and configure the Digi device. The first user to access the Digi

device can choose to disable some of the default root permissions. You are prompted to

change your password the first time you sign in and after a factory reset.

n The admin user is a user name or account that has access to configuration settings defined by

the root user for administrative purposes. The admin user is initially inactive. To activate the

admin user, you must login to the web interface as root and then assign a password to the

admin user. See User Configuration.

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) manages and monitors network ConnectPort LTS
devices. The SNMP architecture enables a network administrator to manage:

n Nodes—servers, workstations, routers, switches, and hubs—on an IP network.

n Network performance, such as finding and solving network problems, and planning for network

growth.

Digi devices support SNMP Versions 1 and 2.

For a list of SNMP-related of supported Request for Comments (RFCs) and Management Information
Bases (MIBs), see Supported RFCs and MIBs.

About Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

SNMP is a widely-used standard protocol that allows you to manage all device nodes on an IP
network, solve network problems, and improve network performance.

Most Digi devices support SNMP versions 1 and 2.

ConnectPort LTS supports SNMP versions 1, 2, and 3.

SNMP is easy to implement in extensive networks because the standard architecture allows you to
easily program new variables and drop in new devices into a network.

However, because device communication is UDP-based, the communication is not secure. If you
require secure communications with a device, use an alternate device interface. Also, SNMP does not
allow you to perform all the tasks available from the ConnectPort LTSweb or command line interfaces,
such as file management, uploading firmware, or backing up and restoring configurations. Compared
to the web or command-line interfaces, SNMP offers a limited set of management and configuration
options.

Management Information Bases (MIBs)
Accessing the SNMP interface requires a tool, such as a network management station. The
management station relies on an agent at a device to retrieve or update the information at the
device, including device configuration, status, and statistical information. This information is viewed as
a logical database, called a Management Information Base (MIB). MIB modules describe MIB variables
for a variety of device types and computer hardware and software components.

Viewing MIB-II components
For an overview of the SNMP interface and the MIB-II components:

1. Go to www.rfc-editor.org/search/rfc_search.php.

2. Search for MIB-II.

3. From the results, select the text file Management Information Base for Network Management of

TCP/IP-based Internets: MIB-II.

SNMP device monitoring capabilities

SNMP provides the following device monitoring capabilities:
n Network statistics, defined in RFC 1213, MIB-II

n Port statistics, defined in RFCs 1316 and 1317

n Device information, defined in Digi enterprise MIB DIGI-DEVICE-INFO.mib

You can use this information to manage network performance, gather device statistics, and find and
solve network problems.

For more information on the statistics available through the standard RFCs listed above, refer to the
RFCs available on the IETF website (www.ietf.org). For enterprise MIBs, refer to the description fields

To download a Digi MIB:

1. Locate the support page for your product:

2. Under Product Support, click the Utilities tab.

3. Locate the MIB you want to view under General Diagnostics, Utilities, and MIBs.

SNMP configuration

You can configure basic network and serial configurations for ConnectPort LTS devices through SNMP:
n Use a subset of standard MIBs for network and serial configuration. See Supported RFCs and

MIBs for more information on supported MIBS.

n Use Digi enterprise MIBs for device identification, alarm handling, and ConnectPort LTS-specific

configurations.

To use the MIBS, you must load MIBs into a network management station (NMS).

Note that some SNMP configuration settings can be configured only from the web or command line
interfaces. For example, to send alarms as SNMP traps:

n In the web interface, use the Configuration > Alarms > alarm > Alarm Destinations > Send

SNMP trap to following destination when alarm occurs option. See Alarms Configuration.

n In the command-line interface, use the set alarm option typescript. See the set alarm

command description in the Digi Connect® Family Command Reference on www.digi.com.

Note You cannot configure all network and serial configurations using SNMP. For more advanced
configuration settings, use the web or command-line interfaces.

Supported SNMP traps

You can enable or disable SNMP traps. Supported SNMP traps include:

n Authentication failure

n Login

n Cold start

n Link up

n Alarms issued in the form of SNMP traps

Warnings for Use of Wireless Devices

CAUTION! Observe all warning notices regarding use of wireless devices.

Potentially Hazardous Atmospheres

Observe restrictions on the use of radio devices in fuel depots, chemical plants, and areas where the
air contains chemicals or particles, such as grain, dust, or metal powders, and any other area where
you would normally be advised to turn off your vehicle engine.

Safety in Aircraft

Switch off the wireless device when instructed to do so by airport or airline staff. If the device offers a
”flight mode” or similar feature, consult airline staff about its use in flight.

Safety in Hospitals

Wireless devices transmit radio frequency energy and may affect medical electrical equipment. Switch
off wireless devices wherever requested to do so in hospitals, clinics, or healthcare facilities. These
requests are designed to prevent possible interference with sensitive medical equipment.

Pacemakers

Pacemaker manufacturers recommended that a minimum of 15cm (6 inches) be maintained between
a handheld wireless device and a pacemaker to avoid potential interference with the pacemaker.
These recommendations are consistent with independent research and recommendations by Wireless
Technology Research.

Persons with Pacemakers

n ALWAYS keep the device more than 15cm (6 inches) from their pacemaker when turned ON.

n Do not carry the device in a breast pocket.

n If you have any reason to suspect that the interference is taking place, turn OFF your device.

Rack-mountable
1. Elevated Operating Ambient Temperature: If installed in a closed or multi-unit rack assembly,

the operating ambient temperature of the rack environment may be greater than room ambient.

Therefore, consideration should be given to installing the equipment in a environment compatible

with the manufacturer’s maximum rated ambient temperature (Tmra).

2. Reduced Air Flow: Installation of the equipment in a rack should be such that the amount of air

flow required for safe operation of the equipment is not compromised.

3. Mechanical Loading: Mounting of the equipment in the rack should be such that a hazardous

condition is not achieved due to uneven mechanical loading.
