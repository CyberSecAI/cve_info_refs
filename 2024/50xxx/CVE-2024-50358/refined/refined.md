- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key, leading to CWE-15 "External Control of System or Configuration Setting".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key which allows for the creation of tampered configuration backups. This bypasses the intended security measures by allowing the attacker to modify configurations with a known key.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can achieve Privilege Escalation, gaining root capabilities over the restricted OpenWRT OS by restoring a tampered configuration backup.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves an authenticated user restoring a malicious configuration backup.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the affected device. They need to create or obtain a tampered configuration backup.
