# [Arbitrary Write Privilege Escalation - CVE-2024-50804](https://g3tsyst3m.github.io/cve/msi/Arbitrary-Write-Privilege-Escalation-CVE-2024-50804/)

This writeup provides an overview of the recently discovered arbitrary write vulnerability in the **MSI Center Pro 2.1.37.0** software for MSI branded machines. MSI has also acknowledged the vulnerability and cooperated with me to deliver a patch. In my final email correspondence with MSI on November 15th 2024, MSI confirmed with me the patch and updated software were successfully released to the Microsoft store. Sure enough, when I browsed the microsoft store per their link below, I could see the new version listed on November 14, 2024.

Here’s the final email I received and confirmation of the fixed version release! See below:

> **Nov 15, 2024, 5:06 AM**

>
> Hi Robbie, MSI Center Pro 2.1.41.0 has been released on Microsoft Store that includes fixes for the two reported vulnerabilities (The Arbitrary Write Vulnerability & the privilege escalation vulnerability).
>
>  https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nq4lgt81kgc?hl=zh-TW≷=TW
>
> We’ve put your name on MSI’s PSIRT Hall of Fame to show our appreciation. Thanks again for the great work and effort.

## ***CVE-2024-50804 - An Overview***

Funny thing is, this was just a simple effort in reviewing local privilege escalation techniques. I started along the path of learning about symlink/junction arbitrary write vulnerabilities. I was first of all intrigued by the fact that a standard user could point symlinks and junctions to privileged directories, such as `c:\windows\system32`.

I then started looking in to this more intentionally, using procmon and opening the various apps I had installed on my MSI laptop. I wanted to see if any odd read/write behavior stood out. I eventually stumbled upon an interesting discovery - A **SYSTEM** process writing to the **ProgramData** folder and renaming a file that I had control over. This is when I really started to get amped. 😸 Let’s dive in and I’ll explain how this initial discovery led to an exciting journey into learning all about arbitrary write local privilege escalation using windows symlinks/junctions!

> **Software Affected**: ***MSI Center Pro 2.1.37.0***

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06879000-c2d8-4a4c-936d-29f8ca354125)

> **Summary**

An Arbitrary write vulnerability exists within the `C:\ProgramData\MSI\One Dragon Center\Data\Data` folder for the MSI Center Pro software. This vulnerability presents an opportunity for elevation of privilege to `NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM` due to the file in question, `Device_DeviceID.dat.bak`, being written to by a `SYSTEM` level process.

> **Discovery**

It was observed by yours truly that many config/log files located within the `C:\ProgramData\MSI\One Dragon Center\Data\Data` directory were being written to by the `NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM` user. This can oftentimes allow for more extensive permissions being granted by default to even a standard user. This on its own is not indicative of compromise, as log files can have explicit permissions preventing abuse of inherited permissions from `ProgramData`. However, in the case of this vulnerability, there exists a weakness with how the .dat files are created within the `Data` directory.

> **The Vulnerability Explained**

A `SYSTEM` arbitrary write vulnerability exists due to how two files are handled by the `C:\Program Files (x86)\MSI\One Dragon Center\MSI.CentralServer.exe` process. The two files in question are `Device_DeviceID.dat` and `Device_DeviceID.dat.bak`, respectively. `The Device_DeviceID.dat` is created after the
`Device_DeviceID.dat.bak` is renamed to `Device_DeviceID.dat`.

`IMAGE A`
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6b22dc6-9a7b-4998-844b-59c481843457)

We can interrupt this process by creating a pseudo-symbolic link that points `Device_DeviceID.dat.bak` to an arbitrary file we have control over (See **Image B**). This will force the renamed `Device_DeviceID.dat` to transform into a **symlink** and take on the inheritable permissions of the `C:\ProgramData\MSI\One Dragon Center\Data\Data` directory. This will also allow our currently logged in `STANDARD` user the ability to delete the newly converted `Device_DeviceID.dat` symlink file, as can be seen in **Image C** below. Otherwise, this file could not be deleted except by a user from the **Administrators** group (See **Image D**).

Here’s how everything plays out when we start the program, `C:\Program Files (x86)\MSI\One Dragon Center\MSI.CentralServer.exe`. The process will begin to write to the `.bak` file, which will then link to our file, and then get renamed to the final `.dat` file.

`IMAGE B`

`IMAGE C`

`IMAGE D`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/908cecb7-f78f-4318-a23f-66d4de567bd4)

Now the previously secured `Device_DeviceID.dat` file can be easily deleted with new permissions applied to the symbolically linked newly created .dat file. See newly applied permissions in **Image E** below:

`IMAGE E`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa2155e5-34f6-494e-a348-89bd9d6c40ef)

**Why does this matter?**

Once the `Data` folder is emptied, a directory `junction` can be created and we can then begn to craft our exploit. We will create two `Object Manager based, RPC
control symbolic links`:

**The first symlink will be for the `.bak` file pointing to our writeable payload, located in the `c:\temp` folder:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e34b8bc5-9b34-4fde-94a1-6cccc876ba79)

The second symlink will be to our privileged target directory we wish to write to. I chose the `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate` directory where we will transfer a custom crafted `.dll` payload to that directory and load it using the task scheduler, thus gaining `NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM` privileges.

The first symlink will force the `.bak` file to take on the permissions of our payload. We then apply those permissions to the second `symlink` which transfers to the target file.

**Here’s the code snippit that accomplishes this:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f12208a-1b3e-4c9d-942d-f9247f54da67)

I figured I would just share the video I submitted to the MSI team to make this next part easier to understand:

(Watching this back, im cringing at my sleep deprived self recording this in like 2 takes and I somehow couldn’t articulate the very simple fact that placing a DLL in the same directory as the executable will make the executable load that DLL 😸 Never miss an opportunity to be humbled right? 😄)

That’s it! Thanks for reading
