The provided content contains information about CVE-2024-50724.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection located in the `editcard.jsp` file of the KSOA application. The `person_id` parameter in the SQL query is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application constructs a SQL query using unsanitized user input. Specifically, the `person_id` parameter from the URL is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL code execution: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the vulnerable parameter which would be executed by the database, leading to potentially unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious GET request to the `editcard.jsp` endpoint.
- Vulnerable parameter: The `person_id` parameter in the URL is used as the injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the KSOA application.
- Understanding of SQL: The attacker needs to know how to create malicious SQL statements.
- Knowledge of vulnerable parameter: The attacker needs to be aware that the `person_id` parameter in the `editcard.jsp` file is vulnerable to SQL Injection.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes a proof of concept (POC) using `sqlmap` which confirms that this is exploitable.
- The specific URL for the injection is:  `http://125.69.99.250:8088/cardcase/editcard.jsp?person_id=2&id=1&classid=1`
- The database is identified as MSSQL.
