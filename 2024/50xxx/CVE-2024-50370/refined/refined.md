- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command, specifically within the processing code associated with the "cfg_cmd_set_eth_conf" operation in the "edgserver" service. This allows for OS command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78), unauthenticated access to the vulnerable service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based exploitation, specifically by interacting with the default "edgserver" service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the "edgserver" service on the target device, which is enabled by default. No authentication is required.
