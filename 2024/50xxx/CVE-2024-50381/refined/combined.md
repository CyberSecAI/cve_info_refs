### 3.2 Vulnerability Overview

#### **3.2.1** [**IMPROPER RESOURCE LOCKING CWE-413**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/413.html)

In Snap One OVRC cloud platform, the Hub is a device that is used to centralize and manage nested devices connected to it. A vulnerability exists where an attacker can impersonate a hub and send device requests to claim already claimed devices. The OVRC cloud platform receives the requests but does not validate if the found devices are already managed by another user.

[CVE-2023-28649](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-28649) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

A base score of 9.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H)).

#### **3.2.2** [**OBSERVABLE RESPONSE DISCREPANCY CWE-204**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/204.html)

When supplying Snap One OVRC cloud servers with a random MAC address, it will return information about the device. The MAC address of devices can be enumerated in an attack and their information will be disclosed by the OVRC cloud.

[CVE-2023-28412](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-28412) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)).

A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE-2023-28412](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-28412).

#### **3.2.3** [**UNPROTECTED ALTERNATE CHANNEL CWE-420**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/420.html)

Snap One OVRC cloud servers contain a route that can be exploited where an attacker can use to bypass requirements and claim devices outright.

[CVE-2023-31241](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-31241) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for [CVE-2023-31241](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-31241). A base score of 9.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H)).

#### **3.2.4** [**CLEARTEXT TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION CWE-319**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)

Snap One OvrC Pro versions prior to 7.3 utilize HTTP connections when downloading a program from their servers. Because it does not use HTTPS, OVRC Pro devices are susceptible to exploitation.

[CVE-2023-31193](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-31193) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

#### **3.2.5** [**IMPROPER VALIDATION OF INTEGRITY CHECK VALUE CWE-354**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/354.html)

Snap One OVRC Pro devices versions 7.2 and prior do not validate firmware updates correctly. The device only calculates the MD5 hash of the firmware and does not check using a private-public key mechanism. The lack of complete PKI system and lack of firmware signature could allow attackers to upload arbitrary firmware updates resulting in code execution.

[CVE-2023-28386](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-28386) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N)).

#### **3.2.6** [**URL REDIRECTION TO UNTRUSTED SITE ('OPEN REDIRECT') CWE-601**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html)

Devices using Snap One OVRC cloud are sent to web address when accessing a web management interface utilizing a HTTP connection. It is possible for attackers to impersonate a device and supply malicious information about the device's web server interface. By supplying malicious parameters, an attacker could redirect the user to arbitrary and dangerous locations on the web.

[CVE-2023-31245](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-31245) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Communications
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** United States

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Uri Katz of Claroty reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Snap One has released the following updates/fixes for the affected products:

* OvrC Pro v7.2 has been automatically pushed out to devices to update via OvrC cloud.
* OvrC Pro v7.3 has been automatically pushed out to devices to update via OvrC cloud.
* Disable UPnP.

For more information, see Snap One's [Release Notes](https://www.control4.com/docs/product/ovrc-software/release-notes/english/latest/ovrc-software-release-notes-rev-p.pdf).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are [not accessible from the internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.
