In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: amd_sfh: Switch to device-managed dmam_alloc_coherent()

Using the device-managed version allows to simplify clean-up in probe()
error path.

Additionally, this device-managed ensures proper cleanup, which helps to
resolve memory errors, page faults, btrfs going read-only, and btrfs
disk corruption.
