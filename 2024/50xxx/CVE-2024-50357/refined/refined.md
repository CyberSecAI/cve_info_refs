Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-50357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the unintentional enabling of REST-APIs in Century Systems FutureNet NXR series routers. Although the REST-APIs are disabled by default, they become unexpectedly enabled when the device is powered on with either the http-server (GUI) or Web authentication enabled. The factory default configuration has http-server enabled, thus enabling the REST-APIs. Additionally, the factory default configuration also includes the username and password for these REST-APIs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unintended Feature Activation:** REST-APIs, which should be disabled by default, are activated unintentionally under specific conditions (GUI or Web authentication enabled).
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** Default username and password for the REST-APIs are present in the factory default configuration.
*   **CWE-684** Improper Synchronization. REST APIs should remain disabled unless explicitly enabled, however a check of the enabled status was not correctly performed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:

*   **Gain unauthorized access:** By using the default credentials, attackers can access the REST-APIs.
*   **Obtain sensitive information:** The attacker can obtain the affected product's settings via the REST-APIs.
*   **Alter device settings:** The attacker can modify the device's settings through the REST-APIs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network via the exposed REST-APIs.
*   **Unauthenticated access:** The default credentials allows unauthenticated access to the REST API if http-server or Web authentication are enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the affected router.
*   **Knowledge of default credentials:** The attacker would need to know the default username and password for REST-APIs.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor provides a firmware update to address the vulnerability.
*   As a temporary workaround, the vendor suggests enabling stateful packet inspection (SPI) and restricting access to trusted IP addresses.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating a critical severity.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as JVNVU#95001899.
*   The identified vulnerable products are FutureNet NXR-G110, NXR-G060 and NXR-G050 series routers, with specific firmware version ranges being affected.
