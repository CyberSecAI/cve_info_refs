- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection') within the processing code associated to the "capture_packages" operation of the "edgserver" service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78), lack of authentication on the "edgserver" service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated remote attackers can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected devices.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, unauthenticated access to the "edgserver" service on the affected devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to interact with the "edgserver" service, which is enabled by default. No prior authentication is required.
