Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-50653

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a business logic flaw within the CRMEB system related to coupon redemption. The system does not properly enforce restrictions on the number of times a user can claim a coupon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation/Rate Limiting:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper server-side validation and rate limiting on coupon claims. The system relies solely on front-end restrictions, which can be easily bypassed.
*   **Business Logic Bypass:** The system fails to prevent multiple coupon claims if the front-end limit is circumvented, leading to abuse of the coupon system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unlimited Coupon Collection:** An attacker can collect an unlimited number of coupons, potentially depleting resources and causing financial loss for the e-commerce platform.
*   **Economic Impact:** The attacker could use these coupons to purchase goods or services at a drastically reduced cost or resell the coupons.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Packet Manipulation:** The attacker intercepts HTTP requests for coupon claims and resends them, bypassing the intended front-end restrictions.
*   **API Abuse:** Attackers directly target the `/api/coupon/receive` endpoint to send multiple requests with the same coupon ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests.
*   **Basic Technical Skills:**  The attacker needs to know how to use tools to capture and resend HTTP requests.

**Additional details from provided content**

*   **Target:** CRMEB <=5.4.0
