{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `vbva_mouse_pointer_shape` structure was defined with a fixed-size 4-byte array (`u8 data[4]`) at the end, intended for accessing pixel data. However, the actual size of the pixel data could vary, leading to a buffer overflow when copying the pixel data using `memcpy`. The driver allocated memory for the structure and pixel data separately, but when accessing `p->data`, it would perform a field-spanning write beyond the allocated 4 bytes when the pixel data exceeded this size.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect usage of a fixed-size array for variable-length data.",
      "Potential buffer overflow during pixel data copy due to inconsistent size handling between the structure definition and the actual pixel data length."
    ],
    "impact": "The `memcpy` operation would write beyond the bounds of the allocated `p->data` array, causing a memory corruption. This could lead to system instability, crashes, or potentially other exploitable conditions.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious guest VM could manipulate the size of the mouse pointer shape/pixel data, triggering the overflow by sending a mouse pointer update with a large pixel payload.",
   "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the pixel data/size of the mouse pointer update from within a guest VM and trigger the vulnerable code path."
  },
  "resolution": "The vulnerability was resolved by changing `u8 data[4]` to `u8 data[]`, creating a flexible array member, now a proper VLA at the end of the structure `vbva_mouse_pointer_shape`. This allows the data to be accessed as `p->data` without causing a field-spanning write as long as memory is allocated for the required amount of pixel data.",
  "extra_details": "The fix included a comment that noted a 4-byte over-allocation in the original code which is preserved by the patch to avoid regressions but not fixed."
