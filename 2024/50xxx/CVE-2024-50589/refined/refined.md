Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-50589:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The HASOMED Elefant software exposes an unprotected Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) API on port 9090. This API does not require any authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Authentication:** The FHIR API is accessible without any authentication mechanism.
*   **Exposed API:** The API is exposed on all interfaces, making it accessible from the local network.
*   **Plain HTTP:** The API is accessible via plain HTTP, meaning data is not encrypted in transit.
*   **Access to Sensitive Data:** The API allows retrieval of sensitive electronic health records (EHR), including patient and physician data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can access and exfiltrate sensitive patient data (including personal information, medical history), as well as physician data.
*   **Privacy Violation:** Unauthorized access to personal health records violates patient privacy.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be on the same local network as the machine running the Elefant software to access the unprotected FHIR API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be able to reach port 9090 of the Elefant server. This typically implies being on the same local network.
*   **No Credentials Required:** The attacker does not need any user credentials or authentication to access the FHIR API.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab.
*   The vulnerable software versions are HASOMED Elefant < 24.04.00.
*   The FHIR API can be queried via HTTP using URLs such as:
    *   `http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:9090/Patient` to retrieve patient data.
    *   `http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:9090/Practitioner/` to retrieve practitioner information.
*   The API responds with XML data containing patient details, which includes identifiers, names, gender, birth dates, and addresses.
