- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A double free vulnerability exists in the `mse102x` driver. The driver attempts to expand the TX skb room, creating a temporary skb (`tskb`). However it incorrectly frees the original skb (`txp`) instead of the temporary one. This leads to a double free when the original skb is later freed in `mse102x_tx_work()`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Double free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** System crash due to a double free. This results in a kernel panic and denial of service. The provided crash log shows the system entering an "Oops" state, indicating a severe error.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered during the transmission of network packets when the TX skb room needs expansion within the `mse102x_tx_frame_spi()` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic through a device using the `mse102x` driver, which will trigger the expansion and hence, the double free.
