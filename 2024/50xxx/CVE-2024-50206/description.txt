In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: mtk_eth_soc: fix memory corruption during fq dma init

The loop responsible for allocating up to MTK_FQ_DMA_LENGTH buffers must
only touch as many descriptors, otherwise it ends up corrupting unrelated
memory. Fix the loop iteration count accordingly.
