- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection'). Multiple parameters of the "sta_log_htm" API are not properly sanitized before being concatenated into OS-level commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OS Command Injection (CWE-78). The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization when constructing OS commands using parameters from the "sta_log_htm" API.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to gain full, unrestricted root access to the wireless access point.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via the "sta_log_htm" API, by injecting malicious code into the unsanitized parameters which are later executed as part of an OS command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the affected device.
