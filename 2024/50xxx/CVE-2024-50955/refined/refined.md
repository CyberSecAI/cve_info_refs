{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The XINJE XL5E series and XD5E series controllers have a vulnerability in handling the TCP protocol. Sending a TCP packet larger than 150,000 bytes to the controller can cause a network crash.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of large TCP packets leads to a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The controller's network interface crashes, becomes unresponsive to ping requests, and normal communication with the PLC is not possible. The error indicator light turns green and the run indicator turns off.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted TCP packet larger than 150,000 bytes to the controller's TCP port.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs network access to the controller, and the ability to send TCP packets to the controller's port (502 in the example)."
