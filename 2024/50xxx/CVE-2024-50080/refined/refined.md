The provided content relates to CVE-2024-50080.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `UBLK_F_USER_COPY` flag, which allows userspace to fill request buffers via `write()` on the ublk char device, was not properly restricted for unprivileged devices. This allowed potentially untrusted userspace to interact with the kernel's ublk driver in a manner that could lead to security issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Uninitialized data exposure:** By not properly filling the request buffer using pwrite(), userspace could cause the kernel to operate on uninitialized data, potentially leading to information leakage.
- **Lack of trust in unprivileged devices**: The kernel was trusting unprivileged devices to provide valid request buffers, which is a security risk.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage**: An attacker could potentially read uninitialized kernel memory by exploiting the improper handling of user-provided data for unprivileged devices.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could create an unprivileged ublk device and then use the `UBLK_F_USER_COPY` flag.
- The attacker would then not fill the request buffer by calling write() on the device, forcing the kernel to work with uninitialized data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create unprivileged ublk devices.
- They also need to be able to interact with the ublk character device.
