In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk: don't allow user copy for unprivileged device

UBLK_F_USER_COPY requires userspace to call write() on ublk char
device for filling request buffer, and unprivileged device can't
be trusted.

So don't allow user copy for unprivileged device.
