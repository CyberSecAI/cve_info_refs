Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-50378:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- When sensitive variables were set via the Airflow CLI, their values were not masked and were included in the audit log and stored unencrypted in the Airflow database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Exposure:** Sensitive variable values were exposed in audit logs and stored unencrypted, violating the principle of least privilege and exposing potentially confidential data.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Masking:** The Airflow CLI did not properly mask or sanitize sensitive data before logging or storing it.
- **Insecure storage:** Sensitive data stored unencrypted in the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authenticated users with access to the audit log could view sensitive variable values they should not have access to.
- Exposure of potentially sensitive data, such as passwords, API keys, or other secrets.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers would need to have valid credentials and access to the Airflow audit logs.
- The vulnerability is triggered when sensitive variables are set via the Airflow CLI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the audit log.
- The attacker must be able to view the audit log, typically through the Airflow UI or database.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Airflow version 2.10.3.
- The fix involved masking the sensitive values in the audit logs.
- Users who previously used the CLI to set secret variables should manually delete entries with those variables from the log table.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #43123.
