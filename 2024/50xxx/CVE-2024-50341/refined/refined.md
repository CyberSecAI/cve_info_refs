{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `Security::login` method in Symfony did not call the custom `user_checker` defined on a firewall when logging in programmatically, which could lead to unwanted logins.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the `Security::login` method not invoking the configured `user_checker`, bypassing important user validation checks.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially bypass user authentication checks, leading to unauthorized access if a custom user checker was intended to prevent this. Although the severity is rated as 'Low', it could have security implications depending on the configuration of the custom user checker.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires low privileges and no user interaction is needed. The attack complexity is considered high, likely requiring knowledge of the system's authentication configuration and the ability to programmatically log in users."
