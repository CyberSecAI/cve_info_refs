The provided content relates to CVE-2024-50144.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an unbalanced power management reference count. Specifically, `fence_fini()` could be called twice if sending a GuC CT (Graphics micro-controller command transport) for a TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) request fails. This happens because the fence is signaled, and an error is returned, causing the caller to also call `fini()` on the error path when using a stack version of the flow, which leads to an extra rpm put().

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double free/unbalanced reference count: Calling `fence_fini()` twice results in decrementing the power management reference count twice, when it should only be decremented once.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The extra `rpm_put()` call can cause the device to enter a suspend state unexpectedly, even when it shouldn't. This could lead to system instability, hangs, or unexpected power state transitions, resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering an error during the sending of the GuC CT for the TLB request, leading to the double call of `fence_fini()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the execution path so an error occurs during the TLB invalidation process, specifically in the sending of the GuC CT for the TLB request. The attacker likely needs to be able to trigger a condition where the `send_tlb_invalidation` function returns a negative value, causing the error handling path to be triggered.
