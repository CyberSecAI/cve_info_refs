Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause lies in a change introduced by commit `d64696905554` which reimplemented `RLIMIT_SIGPENDING` on top of ucounts. This change caused the `UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING` rlimit to be enforced unconditionally, even when `override_rlimit` was set.
- Prior to this commit, the `UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING` rlimit was not enforced for certain signals when `override_rlimit` was set.
- The change in behavior caused issues with signal delivery.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect rlimit enforcement:** The vulnerability is an incorrect enforcement of the `RLIMIT_SIGPENDING` limit when `override_rlimit` is set. This resulted in the limit being checked even when it shouldn't have been.
- **Signal delivery failure:** When the limit is reached, the kernel fails to allocate resources for signal delivery via `sigqueue_alloc`. This failure means that the signal is delivered without `siginfo` data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Loss of signal information:** If a process exceeds the `RLIMIT_SIGPENDING`, any subsequent signals (e.g., `SIGSEGV`) would not be able to deliver `siginfo`. This makes it difficult to debug or handle errors properly.
- **Unpredictable behavior and crashes:** Lack of `siginfo` can lead to unpredictable application behavior and crashes, particularly in cases when the applications rely on `siginfo` data (e.g., to determine the fault address of a segmentation fault). This was observed with Java applications.
- **User-space unawareness:** Applications are not aware that the limit has been reached and that the `siginfo` is corrupted. This lack of transparency exacerbates debugging difficulties.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Triggering excessive signals:** An attacker could craft an application or an attack scenario that sends a large number of signals to a targeted process, exceeding `RLIMIT_SIGPENDING`. This would lead to the inability to deliver signals with `siginfo`
- **Resource exhaustion:** Although not explicitly mentioned in this specific document, resource exhaustion via excessive signals could also be a goal for an attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to send signals:** The attacker would need to be able to send signals to the target process. This could be achieved through a malicious application running in the same system, or by exploiting a vulnerability in another process that allows them to send signals.
- **Trigger a fault signal:** The attacker might need to trigger a fault that results in a `SIGSEGV`, or other signal to cause problems.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves passing `override_rlimit` into `inc_rlimit_get_ucounts()` and skipping the comparison to `max` there if `override_rlimit` is set, effectively restoring the old behavior.
- The provided patches (commits) address this by correctly handling the `override_rlimit` flag during signal handling and rlimit checks.
- The code changes are present in `include/linux/user_namespace.h`, `kernel/signal.c`, and `kernel/ucount.c`.
