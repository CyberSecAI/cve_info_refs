In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm: fix a crash if blk_alloc_disk fails

If blk_alloc_disk fails, the variable md->disk is set to an error value.
cleanup_mapped_device will see that md->disk is non-NULL and it will
attempt to access it, causing a crash on this statement
"md->disk->private_data = NULL;".
