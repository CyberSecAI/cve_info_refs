| Hello vendors,  I'm a security researcher and I perform security testing for free.  I have found a critical vulnerability on the Run Script function which allows attackers to gain remote code execution through PYM file. The attackers could embed a payload in a PYM script to send a connection back to their machines.  The following link is a private Youtube video for demonstration the exploitation steps: <https://youtu.be/SWnN_a1tUNc>  **Tested on:** PyMOL version: 2.5.0 Distributor ID: Ubuntu Description: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS Release: 22.04 Codename: jammy  I strongly suggest you look up on this matter. Have a nice day! |

| Thanks for the issue.  Running scripts unlocks the ability to automate functionality in the application; but of course Python doesn't inspect and restrict functionality inside. The contents of these scripts are also typically human-readable, giving assurance to the user what commands will be ran in the application. There is also an expectation, just as with other applications that run Python scripts, for users in our software to run these scripts only from trusted sources.  From what it seems like PyMOL could improve on, compared to other applications with similar functionality, is to include a warning popup box that warns the user a bit more explicitly. |

| Hello [@JarrettSJohnson](https://github.com/JarrettSJohnson) ,  I understand and respect your opinion. However, many software applications have limitations similar to PyMOL. Since PyMOL has a large user base and is widely used, it is best to notify users that this limitation poses a security risk. I would like to request a CVE ID. A CVE will help raise user awareness, aligning with the mitigation that the vendors suggested earlier. This ensures that the application prioritizes user security as well as privacy.  Similar cases: [CVE-2019-9193](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j83j-hfqj-cf5p "CVE-2019-9193") - PostgreSQL allows authenticated users to gain RCE through SQL statements. [CVE-2023-28311](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8j63-7567-qrrm "CVE-2023-28311") - Microsoft Word allows attackers to embed VBS in document files. |
