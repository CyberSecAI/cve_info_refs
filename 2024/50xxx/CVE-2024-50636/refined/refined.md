The provided content discusses a vulnerability in PyMOL's "Run Script" function that allows for remote code execution (RCE).

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the ability of users to execute arbitrary Python scripts through the "Run Script" feature within PyMOL. This feature, designed for automation, does not sufficiently restrict the functionality of the Python scripts it executes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted Script Execution:** The application allows execution of arbitrary Python code without proper inspection or sandboxing. This enables malicious actors to embed harmful commands into a PYM script.
- **Lack of Explicit Warning:** The application does not explicitly warn users about the risks of running scripts from untrusted sources, unlike some other applications with similar capabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve RCE by embedding malicious code in a PYM script, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. This can lead to a full compromise of the target system.
- **Payload Delivery:** Attackers can embed a payload within the PYM script to establish a connection back to their own systems, allowing for further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **PYM Script File:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious PYM script file. An attacker can create a specially crafted PYM script containing malicious code.
- **User Interaction:** The user is required to open and execute the malicious PYM script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Script Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PYM script containing Python code that can be used for RCE.
- **Social Engineering (or similar):** The attacker would need to find a way to convince the victim to open/run the malicious PYM file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was identified by a security researcher who performed security testing for free.
- The researcher provided a private YouTube video demonstrating the exploitation steps.
- The vulnerability was tested on PyMOL version 2.5.0 on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS.
- The vendor acknowledges the issue as a limitation of the scripting functionality, with a plan to improve the user experience by including a warning pop-up box.
- The researcher requested a CVE ID to raise awareness of the security risk.
- The vendor recommended the researcher to contact a specific email for further exploration of the issue.
