- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of multiple parameters within the "scan_ap" API. These unsanitized parameters are then concatenated into OS-level commands, leading to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-78 "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')" vulnerability is present due to lack of sanitization of input parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to gain full unrestricted root access to the wireless access point.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted requests to the vulnerable "scan\_ap" API with malicious payloads in the affected parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit this vulnerability.
