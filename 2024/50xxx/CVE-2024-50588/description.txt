An unauthenticated attacker with access to the local network of the 
medical office can use known default credentials to gain remote DBA 
access to the Elefant Firebird database. The data in the database 
includes patient data and login credentials among other sensitive data. 
In addition, this enables an attacker to create and overwrite arbitrary 
files on the server filesystem with the rights of the Firebird database 
("NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM").
