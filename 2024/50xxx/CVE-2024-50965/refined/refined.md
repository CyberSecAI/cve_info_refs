The provided content is related to CVE-2024-50965.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a combination of multiple issues, including a newly discovered zero-day vulnerability and the exploitation of existing vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-25434, CVE-2024-25436, and CVE-2024-25438). The zero-day vulnerability allows an author-level user to escalate their privileges to become an administrator. This is achieved by injecting malicious XSS code into the affiliation data and submitting a dummy article, which when viewed by an editor, executes the injected XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerability:** A previously unknown flaw in the OJS code that enables privilege escalation.
*   **XSS Vulnerability:** The ability to inject XSS code through the affiliation field during author profile editing.
*   **Insecure Code:** The vulnerability lies within the `/lib/pkp/controllers/grid/settings/user/form/UserForm.inc.php` where user roles are assigned, and also in `/lib/pkp/controllers/grid/users/author/form/PKPAuthorForm.inc.php` which allows XSS injection.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The ability to upload and execute arbitrary PHP files (backdoor).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can escalate privileges from author to administrator.
*   **Full Server Control:** Once an attacker has administrator access, they can gain full control of the server via the uploaded backdoor.
*   **Backdoor Installation:** Attackers can upload a malicious PHP file (as.php) which gives them SSH access via Netcat.
*   **Website Defacement:** Hackers can add cloaked links to gambling or porn sites, redirecting the site's purpose.
*   **SEO Manipulation:** The site can be manipulated to promote gambling sites, impacting the website's ranking on search engines.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker can steal user credentials from the system.
*   **Reputation Damage:** The site can be flagged as malicious and blocked by browsers.
*   **Google Scholar indexing removal:** The site might be removed from Google Scholar indexing.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Author Account:** An attacker can use a compromised author account or create a new one.
*   **XSS Injection:** Malicious code is injected into the author's profile (affiliation field).
*   **Dummy Article Submission:** The attacker submits a dummy article.
*   **Editor Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when the editor views the submission, executing the XSS code and escalating the author's privileges.
*  **Plugin Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious plugin once they are an admin.
* **Netcat Shell:** The backdoor allows the attacker to gain remote shell access to the server via Netcat.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Must have an account on the OJS system with at least author-level privileges.
*   Ability to manipulate data within the author profile.
*   Basic knowledge of XSS attacks.
*   Ability to upload a plugin and inject malicious code into the OJS system (requires admin privileges).
