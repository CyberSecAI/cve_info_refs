The provided content relates to a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's NTFS3 file system driver. Specifically, it concerns a missing check in the `ntfs_file_release` function which could lead to a race condition and potential use-after-free.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `ntfs_file_release` function in the NTFS3 driver attempts to drop block reservations when the last writer closes a file. This operation involves acquiring a write lock (`ni->file.run_lock`). However, this lock is not initialized for the MFT (Master File Table) inode, which leads to a race condition and potential use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Race condition:** When the last writer closes a file and it is not the MFT record, the code attempts to acquire `ni->file.run_lock`. However, this lock is not initialized for the MFT inode. If `ntfs_file_release` is called for the MFT record, it can lead to a race condition, and potentially access memory after it has been freed, leading to a use-after-free situation.
- **Missing check:** The initial code lacked a check to ensure that the lock is initialized before acquiring it, specifically for the MFT record.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Use-after-free:** Exploitation of the race condition could result in a use-after-free, potentially leading to a kernel crash or, in some cases, arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to trigger a file close operation when the preallocation feature is enabled.
- Specifically, the attacker needs to be the last writer on the inode and, additionally, needs to trigger this for the MFT record (inode with i_ino equal to MFT_REC_MFT), which is implicitly used by the filesystem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to write to and close files on an NTFS3 filesystem with preallocation enabled.
- They need to be able to trigger the release operation on the MFT record.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided patches add an additional check `inode->i_ino != MFT_REC_MFT` in the `ntfs_file_release` function, preventing the lock acquisition for MFT inode and thus mitigating the race condition.
- The vulnerability was reported by syzbot.
- The patches are backported to stable branches.
