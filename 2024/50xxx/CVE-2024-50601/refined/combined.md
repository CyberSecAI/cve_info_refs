# Axigen WebMail Persistent and Reflected XSS Vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-50601)

Persistent and reflected XSS vulnerabilities in the themeMode cookie and \_h URL parameters allow attackers to execute arbitrary Javascript through a multi-stage attack, potentially resulting in session hijacking and data exfiltration.

## Details

**Affected versions:**

Axigen 10.3.x up to 10.3.3.66; [fixed starting with 10.3.3.67](https://www.axigen.com/updates/axigen-10.3.3.67)

Axigen 10.4.x up to 10.4.41; [fixed starting with 10.4.42](https://www.axigen.com/updates/axigen-10.4.42)

Axigen 10.5.x up to 10.5.28; [fixed starting with 10.5.29](https://www.axigen.com/updates/axigen-10.5.29)

**Vulnerability type:**Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected component(s):**Axigen WebMail

**Description:**

The XSS vulnerabilities affect the themeMode cookie and \_h parameter, allowing attackers to:

**1. Inject Javascript** — attackers can inject execute Javascript by taking advantage of lack of sanitization in the \_h parameter. Since they are able to execute Javascript in the WebMail, they can also change the account's cookie values.

**2.** **Execute Code Persistently**— with cookie values changed to malicious Javascript payloads, taking advantage of an XSS vulnerability where WebMail reflects unsanitized cookie values, attackers can execute code persistently, as long as the cookie value they've set contains the malicious payload.

This multi-stage attack leverages the persistent nature of various application cookies (e.g. themeMode, readingPane), allowing attackers to maintain access and potentially conduct further actions within the user’s WebMail environment.
