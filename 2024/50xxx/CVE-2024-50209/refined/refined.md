Based on the provided information, this commit addresses a vulnerability in the `bnxt_re` driver related to memory allocation.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `__alloc_pbl()` function, responsible for allocating memory for page block lists (PBLs), can return an error if memory allocation fails. The driver was not checking the return status of `__alloc_pbl()` in one instance within the `bnxt_qplib_alloc_init_hwq` function, leading to a potential use-after-free or null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper error handling: The driver fails to check the return value of `__alloc_pbl()`, which can indicate a memory allocation failure.
- Potential for use-after-free or null pointer dereference: If `__alloc_pbl()` fails, the driver might proceed with an invalid PBL pointer, which may lead to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A failure to allocate memory and lack of error handling might lead to a crash due to a null pointer dereference or use-after-free. The impact is a denial-of-service due to a kernel crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by a failed memory allocation during the initialization of a hardware queue. This could be triggered by system memory stress or potentially by an attacker attempting to exhaust system resources to cause the allocation to fail.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker does not need direct access to the vulnerable code. The attacker must be able to trigger the execution path that leads to `bnxt_qplib_alloc_init_hwq`. The attacker might need to cause memory pressure on the target machine so the memory allocation within the function fails.
