In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: qcom: videocc-sm8350: use HW_CTRL_TRIGGER for vcodec GDSCs

A recent change in the venus driver results in a stuck clock on the
Lenovo ThinkPad X13s, for example, when streaming video in firefox:

	video_cc_mvs0_clk status stuck at 'off'
	WARNING: CPU: 6 PID: 2885 at drivers/clk/qcom/clk-branch.c:87 clk_branch_wait+0x144/0x15c

using the out-of-tree sm8350/sc8280xp venus support. [1]

Update also the sm8350/sc8280xp GDSC definitions so that the hw control
mode can be changed at runtime as the venus driver now requires.
