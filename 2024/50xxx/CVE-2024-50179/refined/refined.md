The provided content relates to a fix for a bug in the Ceph file system within the Linux kernel. The bug involves an incorrect check for a file write (Fw) reference when marking pages as dirty during direct-io reads. This content is related to CVE-2024-50179 as it addresses a potential issue in the Ceph file system.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability and the fix:

**Root Cause:**

- The `ceph_dirty_folio` and `ceph_set_page_dirty` functions in `fs/ceph/addr.c` incorrectly asserted that the caller must hold a file write (Fw) reference (`ci->i_wr_ref`) when marking pages as dirty.
- This assumption is incorrect because direct-io reads can also mark pages as dirty without holding the Fw capability. The direct I/O path does not hold the Fw caps and can obtain the Fw reference in certain cases.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect Assumption:** The code assumed that any operation marking pages as dirty held the Fw reference, leading to a BUG_ON assertion failure.
- **Potential for Kernel Panic:** The `BUG_ON` macro would cause a kernel panic if triggered, which would lead to a denial-of-service.
- **Limited to direct-io reads:** The issue is only present during direct-io reads

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The immediate impact of this vulnerability is a kernel panic due to the incorrect `BUG_ON` assertion during the direct-io read path.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A local attacker could trigger the bug by performing direct-io reads on a ceph file system

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have a way to perform direct-io reads on a mounted Ceph file system.
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the machine.

**Fix:**

- The fix removes the `BUG_ON(ci->i_wr_ref == 0)` check, which eliminates the incorrect assertion.
- This allows direct-io reads to correctly mark pages as dirty, avoiding the kernel panic.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix addresses an assertion failure that was triggered when the code incorrectly assumed a file write (Fw) reference was always held when marking pages dirty,
- The code change affects functions `ceph_dirty_folio` and `ceph_set_page_dirty` in `/fs/ceph/addr.c`, which mark the page dirty in ceph filesystem.

This commit addresses a bug that, while not directly exploitable for arbitrary code execution, leads to a denial-of-service due to a kernel panic.
