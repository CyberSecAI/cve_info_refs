The content is related to CVE-2024-50766.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection in the `takeSurvey.php` file of the Source Codester Survey Application System. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `id` parameter in the URL into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the SQL injection in the `takeSurvey.php` file, specifically within the SQL query used to retrieve survey data based on the `id` parameter.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The SQL injection vulnerability can be further exploited to inject JavaScript code, leading to XSS attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data leakage:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including admin password hashes and other user data.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injection of malicious javascript leading to client-side attacks.
- **Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Though not directly achievable due to SQLite's default restrictions on file I/O, RCE might be possible if the SQLite instance is misconfigured with extensions that allow file writes. This can enable an attacker to write a PHP shell.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `takeSurvey.php` with a manipulated `id` parameter, for example adding a single quote to cause an SQL error and later to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required.
