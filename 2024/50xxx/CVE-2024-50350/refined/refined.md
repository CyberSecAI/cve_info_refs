Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2024-50350:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of the "name" parameter when creating a new Port Group. This unsanitized input is later rendered on the "Port Settings" page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input (the "name" parameter of a port group) before storing it in the database. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability is located in `librenms/app/Http/Controllers/Table/EditPortsController.php`. The code lacked proper encoding or sanitization of the port group's name when rendering it within HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of other users' sessions when they visit the "Port Settings" page.
*   **User Account Compromise:** This could lead to the compromise of user accounts and unauthorized actions performed on their behalf.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The injected script could steal session cookies, potentially leading to account takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network via HTTP requests.
*   **Form Submission:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to create a new port group, injecting the XSS payload in the "name" parameter.
*   **Stored Payload:** The malicious payload is stored in the database and is triggered when a user loads the "Port Settings" page which renders the stored "name" parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the LibreNMS application with the ability to create port groups.
*   **High Privileges:** The CVSS score indicates that high privileges are required, further indicating that a user with higher level permissions is necessary to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The exploit requires user interaction as the malicious code execution triggers when another user visits the port settings page.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** LibreNMS versions up to and including 24.9.1 are affected.
*  **Patched Versions:** LibreNMS version 24.10.0 addresses this vulnerability by applying the `htmlentities()` function to the output where port group names were being displayed.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided PoC demonstrates how to create a new port group with a malicious payload and trigger the vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.5, classified as High severity.
*   **CWE:** The identified weakness is CWE-79, Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').

In summary, this is a stored XSS vulnerability that allows authenticated users to inject malicious JavaScript code which is later executed when other users visit the port settings page. This could lead to serious security issues, including session compromise and unauthorized actions.
