The content relates to CVE-2024-50252.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Mellanox mlxsw driver fails to properly manage IPv6 addresses used for IP-in-IP encapsulation. When changing the remote IPv6 address of an ip6gre network device, the driver does not remove the old address from its hash table or add the new address.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A memory leak occurs because the old IPv6 address is not released when a new one is configured. Additionally, the new address isn't correctly added to the hash table, which could lead to incorrect routing or encapsulation.

**Impact of exploitation:** The memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion over time. Also, incorrect address mapping due to the failure to update the hash table could lead to unpredictable network behavior.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by modifying the remote IPv6 address of an ip6gre network device via the `ip link` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to configure network devices to exploit the vulnerability. This typically requires root or administrator privileges on the system.
