{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `ndev->dev` and `pdev->dev` were not the same device in the ARC EMAC driver, leading to incorrect DMA mapping and unmapping. The correct device to use for DMA operations is `ndev->dev.parent`, which holds the necessary `dma_mask`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect device used for DMA mapping and unmapping operations."
    ],
    "impact": "The incorrect device usage could lead to DMA mapping errors, causing the driver to fail to transmit or receive packets. The kernel could also issue a warning due to the incorrect usage, specifically a warning at `kernel/dma/mapping.c:149` in `dma_map_page_attrs`.",
    "attack_vectors": "Not directly applicable as this is a bug in the driver code that causes a crash/warning. There isn't an attack vector in the sense of someone causing it.",
    "required_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are needed. The issue occurs during normal network operation with ARC EMAC device."
  },
    "affected_component": "drivers/net/ethernet/arc/emac_main.c",
  "additional_notes": "The fix involves replacing `&ndev->dev` with `ndev->dev.parent` in the `dma_map_single` and `dma_unmap_single` calls. The `ndev->dev.parent` corresponds to the parent device of the network device and has dma_mask, which is needed for proper DMA operations."
