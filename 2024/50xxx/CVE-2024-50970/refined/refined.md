Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `orderview1.php` file of the Itsourcecode Online Furniture Shopping Project 1.0. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input passed through the `id` parameter in `orderview1.php`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** A successful SQL injection attack enables the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Database Dump:** Using tools like SQLMap, attackers can dump the entire database content.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `orderview1.php` page, specifically manipulating the `id` parameter.
*   **Direct Injection:** The attacker directly injects SQL payloads into the `id` parameter of the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL to craft a malicious payload.
*   **Ability to Manipulate HTTP Request:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the URL parameters in the HTTP request.
*   **Account on the application:** The attacker needs to register an account on the vulnerable web application to access the vulnerable page.
