Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-50593:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Elefant Service Software uses a hardcoded "Hotline" password to access restricted functions. This password is included directly within the Elefant Service binary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The primary weakness is the inclusion of a static, easily discoverable password within the software's binary. This eliminates the need for any complex cracking attempts; the password is readily available through reverse engineering or string analysis.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with local access to the medical office computer can bypass intended access controls and use restricted functions of the Elefant Service tool. The specific capabilities available through these restricted functions are not detailed, but it implies a level of access beyond what a regular user should have.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires an attacker to have local access to the machine where the Elefant Service software is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to log into or otherwise execute code on the target system.
*   **Technical Skills:** Basic reverse engineering or string analysis skills to extract the hardcoded password from the binary.

**Additional Notes**

*   The advisory mentions that the hardcoded password is in both the Elefant and Elefant Service binaries.
*   This vulnerability is part of a set of vulnerabilities found in HASOMED Elefant software, including issues such as database access with default credentials, an exposed FHIR API, and multiple local privilege escalations.
