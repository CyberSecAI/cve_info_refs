- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Domain Sharding Plugin version 1.2.1 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into executing it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into submitting a crafted request. This can be achieved by various methods such as malicious links, images, or iframes. The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs the victim to be authenticated.
