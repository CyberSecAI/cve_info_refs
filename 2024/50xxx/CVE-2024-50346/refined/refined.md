The provided content relates to CVE-2024-50346.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from multiple instances of improper HTML sanitization and injection within the WebFeed extension. Specifically, the extension uses `innerHTML` to render content from RSS feeds and other sources without adequate sanitization, allowing for injection of malicious HTML. The `html2txt` utility was found to be ineffective against deeply nested HTML structures.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting):** The core issue is the injection of malicious HTML into the extension's UI. This enables an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the extension.
- **CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** By injecting malicious HTML, specifically forms, an attacker can force the user to perform actions on other websites without their consent or knowledge. This occurs because the extension has `<all_urls>` host permissions, allowing it to make cross-site requests with user cookies.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **CSRF attacks:** An attacker can use the injected HTML forms to send cross-site requests with the victim's cookies, potentially leading to unwanted actions on arbitrary websites.
- **UI spoofing:** Malicious HTML can be injected into the extension's UI, which could trick the user into performing actions they did not intend.
- Potential execution of arbitrary Javascript within the context of the extension.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker provides malicious RSS feeds.
- The victim user is tricked into visiting the malicious RSS feed using the WebFeed extension.
- Malicious HTML within the feed is then rendered within the extension's UI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious RSS feed.
- The attacker needs to entice a WebFeed user to subscribe to the malicious feed.
- No special privileges are required as the exploit is triggered via user interaction with a malicious feed.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions <= 0.9.1 and was patched in version 0.9.2
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) includes an `index.html`, `feed.xml`, and `server.py` demonstrating the vulnerability in a local testing environment.
- The PoC shows that CSRF attacks are normally blocked by the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) but can be bypassed via the extension's permissions and the HTML injection.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Moderate".
- The advisory includes CVSS v4 metrics.
