The provided content relates to a fix for a potential CPU lockup in the `bnxt_re` driver due to an infinite loop while waiting for the FIFO occupancy to go below a threshold. This directly addresses the issue described in the commit messages.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The driver waits indefinitely for the FIFO occupancy to drop below a certain threshold after receiving a pacing interrupt.  If the rate of doorbell (DB) is very high, the FIFO might not reach the threshold, causing the loop to continue indefinitely, leading to a soft lockup on the processor.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Infinite loop:** The `__wait_for_fifo_occupancy_below_th` function could potentially loop indefinitely if the FIFO occupancy never drops below the pacing threshold.
- **Soft lockup:** This indefinite loop leads to a soft lockup on the processor executing the driver code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A soft lockup on a CPU core running the driver can lead to denial of service and system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- High rate of doorbell writes can exacerbate the condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be in a position to trigger a high rate of doorbell writes to the RDMA device, causing the pacing mechanism to engage frequently and heavily load the FIFO.
- No special privileges required.
