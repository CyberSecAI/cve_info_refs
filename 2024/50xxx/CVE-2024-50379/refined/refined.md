Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-50379:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content includes a NetApp security advisory (NTAP-20250103-0003) that explicitly mentions "CVE-2024-50379 Apache Tomcat Vulnerability in NetApp Products". The content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition during JSP compilation in Apache Tomcat.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** A TOCTOU (Time-of-check Time-of-use) race condition exists. This type of vulnerability occurs when there is a change in the state of the system between the time a security check is performed and the time the checked resource is used. In this case, the vulnerability occurs during JSP compilation. This is specific to file systems where filename case is ignored, in combination with a non-default Tomcat configuration where the default servlet is enabled for write operations.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    *   Disclosure of sensitive information
    *   Addition or modification of data
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via JSP compilation within Apache Tomcat in a specific configuration (case insensitive file system and default servlet enabled for write).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would require the ability to trigger the JSP compilation process in a vulnerable environment. The NetApp advisory mentions public discussion about the vulnerability. The specific method of exploitation is not detailed, but it is known that this vulnerability is present in versions that have a non-default servlet config enabled for write.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The NetApp advisory identifies several products as being vulnerable, specifically:
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for Linux
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for Microsoft Windows
    *   Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere
*   Other products are listed as "Under Investigation".
*   Many NetApp products are explicitly listed as "Not Affected".
*   The NetApp advisory provides a CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8 (CRITICAL) with vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   The advisory also links to the Apache Tomcat mailing list announcement of the vulnerability, which is more detailed about the root cause.
*   The vulnerability affects Apache Tomcat versions 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.1, 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.33, and 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.97.
*   NetApp recommends upgrading to Apache Tomcat versions 11.0.2, 10.1.34, or 9.0.98.
*   The openwall.com content provides the Apache mailing list post, further detailing the nature of the vulnerability as being a TOCTOU issue during JSP compilation and includes a CVE reference.
