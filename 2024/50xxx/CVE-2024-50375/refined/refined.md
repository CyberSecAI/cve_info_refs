- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authentication for a critical function in the "edgserver" service on Advantech EKI-6333AC series devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-306 "Missing Authentication for Critical Function." Specifically, the default "edgserver" service on the affected devices does not require authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated remote users can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access. An attacker needs to be able to interact with the "edgserver" service, which is enabled by default on the access point.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the "edgserver" service on the network. No authentication is required.
