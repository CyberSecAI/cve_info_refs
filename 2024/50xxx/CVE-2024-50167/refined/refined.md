{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `be_xmit()` function in the be2net driver could return `NETDEV_TX_OK` without freeing the skb (socket buffer) when `be_xmit_enqueue()` fails.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A memory leak could occur when a transmission fails due to an error in `be_xmit_enqueue()`. Repeated failures could lead to memory exhaustion.",
    "attack_vectors": "By triggering a failure in `be_xmit_enqueue()`",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network packets that trigger the failure condition in `be_xmit_enqueue()`."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix adds `dev_kfree_skb_any(skb)` in the `drop_skb` label to ensure that the socket buffer is freed when `be_xmit_enqueue()` fails."
