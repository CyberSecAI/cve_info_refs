The provided content relates to a fix for a potential deadlock in the ext4 filesystem driver in the Linux kernel.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The ext4 filesystem, when mounted with the `errors=remount-ro` option, was setting the `SB_RDONLY` flag on the superblock upon encountering errors. This was done to prevent further filesystem modifications. However, this operation bypassed proper locking mechanisms using the `sb->s_umount` semaphore and the filesystem remount procedure. This resulted in a race condition where the `SB_RDONLY` flag could be modified while the filesystem was being frozen, which could lead to deadlocks or other issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper locking when setting `SB_RDONLY` flag
- Race condition due to modifying the superblock flag directly without going through the correct remount procedure.
- Confusion of code such as `freeze_super()` due to unexpected changes in the `SB_RDONLY` flag.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Deadlocks in filesystem freezing.
-  Other unspecified problems.
-  Warnings due to the race condition on the SB_RDONLY flag.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering filesystem errors when mounted with `errors=remount-ro`.
- Syzbot fuzzer was able to trigger the condition, suggesting a non-obvious sequence of events to trigger the problem.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to cause filesystem errors on an ext4 partition mounted with `errors=remount-ro`.
- No specific position is specified, but it is likely to be a local attack.

The fix involves removing the setting of the `SB_RDONLY` flag in the `ext4_handle_error` function. The `EXT4_FLAGS_SHUTDOWN` flag, which is already set, is sufficient to prevent further filesystem modifications, making the `SB_RDONLY` modification unnecessary.
