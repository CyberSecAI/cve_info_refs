The provided content relates to a fix for a potential memory allocation failure in the Linux kernel's SMB client implementation, specifically when handling passwords during a remount operation. This fix is relevant to CVE-2024-50120 as it addresses a resource management issue that could lead to a denial-of-service.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability and the fix:

**Root Cause:**

- The `smb3_reconfigure` function in `fs/smb/client/fs_context.c` was not properly handling potential memory allocation failures when duplicating passwords using `kstrdup()`. This function is called during a remount operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Missing Error Handling:** The original code didn't check the return value of `kstrdup()` when allocating memory for `ses->password` and `ses->password2`. If `kstrdup()` fails (returns NULL due to insufficient memory), the code would continue, leading to a null pointer dereference or other undefined behavior later on. This can lead to a denial-of-service.
- **Memory Leak (partial):** If allocation for `ses->password2` fails after allocating `ses->password`, the already allocated memory for `ses->password` would be leaked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A failed memory allocation can cause the system to become unstable and possibly crash, resulting in denial of service. The vulnerability exists during remount operations so an attacker might be able to trigger a DoS through repeated remount requests while denying memory resources to the kernel.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remount Operation:** The vulnerability can be triggered by initiating an SMB remount operation.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** An attacker can potentially trigger the vulnerability by exhausting system memory, making the `kstrdup` call fail. This would not need root access as this occurs in the SMB mounting process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to trigger remount:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger a remount operation on an SMB file system.
- **Ability to exhaust memory:** The attacker could potentially trigger the issue by exhausting kernel memory, leading to the `kstrdup` failure.

**Fix:**

The fix implemented in the provided patches adds checks for the return value of `kstrdup()`.  Here's how the fix works:

1. **Check `ses->password` allocation:** After `ses->password = kstrdup(ctx->password, GFP_KERNEL)`, the code checks if `ses->password` is NULL. If it is, it returns `-ENOMEM`, indicating a memory allocation failure.
2. **Check `ses->password2` allocation:** After `ses->password2 = kstrdup(ctx->password2, GFP_KERNEL)`, the code checks if `ses->password2` is NULL.
    - If the allocation fails, the code frees `ses->password` if it was already allocated, sets `ses->password` to NULL, and returns `-ENOMEM`.

This fix ensures that the system will gracefully handle memory allocation failures during the password duplication, preventing a crash. The fix also prevents a potential memory leak if the second allocation fails after the first one was successful.
