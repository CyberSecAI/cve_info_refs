In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock/virtio: Initialization of the dangling pointer occurring in vsk->trans

During loopback communication, a dangling pointer can be created in
vsk->trans, potentially leading to a Use-After-Free condition.  This
issue is resolved by initializing vsk->trans to NULL.
