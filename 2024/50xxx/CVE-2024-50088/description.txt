In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix uninitialized pointer free in add_inode_ref()

The add_inode_ref() function does not initialize the "name" struct when
it is declared.  If any of the following calls to "read_one_inode()
returns NULL,

	dir = read_one_inode(root, parent_objectid);
	if (!dir) {
		ret = -ENOENT;
		goto out;
	}

	inode = read_one_inode(root, inode_objectid);
	if (!inode) {
		ret = -EIO;
		goto out;
	}

then "name.name" would be freed on "out" before being initialized.

out:
	...
	kfree(name.name);
