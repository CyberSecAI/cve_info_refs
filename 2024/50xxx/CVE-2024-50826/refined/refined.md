This GitHub page displays a PDF file named "SQL Injection - add content.pdf" within a repository called "Writeups." The file path indicates it is likely a write-up about a SQL injection vulnerability found in "Kashipara." However, the page itself does not provide details about the vulnerability described in the PDF, and the CVE description is a placeholder. Therefore, it's not possible to extract vulnerability information directly from this content.
