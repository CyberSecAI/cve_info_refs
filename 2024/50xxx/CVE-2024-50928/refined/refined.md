{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insecure permissions in Silicon Labs (SiLabs) Z-Wave Series 700 and 800 v7.21.1.",
    "weaknesses": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls within the Z-Wave SDK, allowing unauthorized modification of device parameters.",
    "impact": "An attacker can change the wakeup interval of end devices in controller memory, preventing the controller's periodic communication with the end device. The end device behavior is not impacted by this change. This leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) by disrupting communications between the controller and the device.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted, malicious Z-Wave packets to the Z-Wave controller. The attacker needs to be within a range of 40 to 100 meters, though this range can be increased using advanced SDR hardware.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to sniff Z-Wave communications, retrieve the Z-Wave HomeID and NodeID of devices, and craft and send malicious Z-Wave packets. They require tools like Scapy-radio with HackRF One, Yard Stick One, RFCat, RTL-SDR or Zniffer with Sigma UZB to intercept and transmit packets."
