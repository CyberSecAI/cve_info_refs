The provided content relates to a bug in the Linux kernel where a sleeping function is called from an invalid context due to page allocation attempts while holding a spinlock. This issue occurs specifically when KASAN and PREEMPT_RT are enabled.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The `task_tick_mm_cid()` function, introduced in kernel v6.4, uses `task_work_add()` to schedule work.
- When KASAN is enabled, `task_work_add()` calls `kasan_record_aux_stack()`, which can lead to a page allocation via `stack_depot_save_flags()`.
- The `task_tick_mm_cid()` function is called while holding the `rq` lock, which is a raw spinlock.
- Attempting to allocate memory while holding a raw spinlock leads to a sleeping function being called from an invalid context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Incorrect context for calling `alloc_pages()`.
- Potential for a race condition where the `rq` lock is held and memory allocation is attempted.
- Lack of appropriate safeguards to avoid memory allocation when needed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Kernel crash due to the "sleeping function called from invalid context" error.
- System instability
- Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered through normal kernel operation and doesn't require any specific userland input.
- It occurs when the `task_tick_mm_cid()` function is executed, which is part of the scheduler and can be triggered by timer interrupts

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- This is not directly exploitable by an external attacker.
- The attacker must have the ability to enable KASAN and PREEMPT_RT on the target system, which is generally only possible for privileged users or system administrators.

**Additional Information:**

- The fix introduces a new flag, `TWAF_NO_ALLOC`, to `task_work_add()`. When set, it uses the `kasan_record_aux_stack_noalloc()` variant, which avoids page allocation.
- The patch modifies `task_tick_mm_cid()` to use this flag.
- A minor drawback is that when `TWAF_NO_ALLOC` is set, stack traces in KASAN reports could potentially be missing under rare conditions if allocation is needed.
- The issue only occurs when both KASAN and PREEMPT_RT are enabled, which is not a default configuration in most systems.
