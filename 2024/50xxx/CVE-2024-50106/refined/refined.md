{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists between the laundromat thread handling revoked delegations and a client sending a free_stateid operation. The laundromat thread marks a delegation's state ID (stid) as revoked and adds it to a reaper list, but the actual revocation happens without holding the state lock. Concurrently, a free_stateid processing thread can remove the stid from the reaper list and free the stid structure. This leaves the laundromat thread unable to release the lock lease on the file. Subsequently, a new open operation on the same file attempts to access the freed state ID, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Race condition",
    "Use-after-free"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A use-after-free vulnerability can lead to a system crash and potentially allow arbitrary code execution if exploited further.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by creating a situation where a delegation is revoked, and concurrently sending a free_stateid operation. Subsequent new open requests on the same file will trigger the use-after-free condition.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to interact with the NFS server to create delegations, trigger their revocation, and send free_stateid operations. This requires network access to the NFS server."
