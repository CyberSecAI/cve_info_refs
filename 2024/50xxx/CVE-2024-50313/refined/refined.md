Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2024-50313:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a race condition in the basic authentication implementation within Mendix Runtime. This occurs when multiple login attempts happen concurrently.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition (CWE-362):** The core weakness lies in the lack of proper synchronization when handling concurrent login attempts, leading to a race condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Circumvention of Account Lockout:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass the default account lockout mechanisms. This means that even if an account is supposed to be locked out after multiple failed login attempts, the attacker can potentially continue trying login attempts.
*  **Potential for Credential Stuffing/Brute Force:**  The lack of effective lockout gives attackers a wider window to carry out credential stuffing or brute-force attacks on user accounts, greatly increasing the likelihood of a successful compromise

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attack is performed remotely over a network.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not require prior authentication or valid credentials to attempt the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Mendix application.
*   **Ability to Send Concurrent Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send multiple login requests concurrently to trigger the race condition.

**Additional Notes:**
* Mendix Runtime versions 8, 9, and 10 are affected.
*   Specific versions within Mendix Runtime 9 and 10 have received fixes. It is recommended to upgrade to versions: 
    * 9.24.29 or later,
    * 10.16.0 or later, 
    * 10.6.15 or later,
    * 10.12.7 or later.
* Mendix Runtime V8 currently doesn't have a fix. Workarounds or mitigations such as disabling basic authentication and using an alternative authentication are recommended.
*   The vulnerability only affects applications using the basic authentication mechanism.
* CVSS v3.1 base score is 5.3, CVSS v4.0 base score is 6.9
