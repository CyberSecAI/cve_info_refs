In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_payload: sanitize offset and length before calling skb_checksum()

If access to offset + length is larger than the skbuff length, then
skb_checksum() triggers BUG_ON().

skb_checksum() internally subtracts the length parameter while iterating
over skbuff, BUG_ON(len) at the end of it checks that the expected
length to be included in the checksum calculation is fully consumed.
