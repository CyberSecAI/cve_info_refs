In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Fix incorrect pci_for_each_dma_alias() for non-PCI devices

Previously, the domain_context_clear() function incorrectly called
pci_for_each_dma_alias() to set up context entries for non-PCI devices.
This could lead to kernel hangs or other unexpected behavior.

Add a check to only call pci_for_each_dma_alias() for PCI devices. For
non-PCI devices, domain_context_clear_one() is called directly.
