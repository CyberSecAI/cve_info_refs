Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-50637:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input within the "Create User" function of the UnoPim application. Specifically, the vulnerability allows for the injection of malicious code via SVG file extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The application fails to sanitize or properly encode user-provided data, leading to stored XSS.
- Improper Input Handling: The application accepts SVG files without adequate validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Cookie Stealing: Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to the theft of user cookies.
- Session Hijacking: By stealing cookies, attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to user sessions.
- Other XSS impacts: An attacker might be able to redirect a user to a malicious site, deface pages, or perform other actions in the context of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack can be performed remotely via a network connection.
- The vulnerability exists in the "Create User" function, where a user can upload an SVG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- No special attack requirements exist.
- The attacker needs to be able to provide user input via the "Create User" functionality.
- User interaction is required: A user must interact with the malicious content that is stored by the attacker (passive user interaction).

**Additional Details:**

- Affected versions: UnoPim versions prior to 0.1.4
- Patched version: 0.1.4
- The vulnerability is classified as having a "Moderate" severity.
- CVSS v4 base score: 5.3
- The vulnerability is identified by CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).

**Summary of fix:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 0.1.4 of UnoPim with a fix for a stored XSS vulnerability.
