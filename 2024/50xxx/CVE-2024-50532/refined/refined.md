- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Events Manager Pro â€“ extended WordPress plugin version 0.1 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially force logged-in users to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact will vary depending on the actions available within the plugin.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website, which would then send the forged request to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in user to perform an action that triggers the crafted request. The attacker does not require authentication on the target site but requires the user to be authenticated.
