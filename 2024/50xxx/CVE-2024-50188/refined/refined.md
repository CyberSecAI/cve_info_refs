- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The DP83869 PHY driver incorrectly calls `linkmode_set_bit()` with a bitmask instead of a bit number when configuring the fiber port.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The incorrect bitmask corrupts other memory locations, potentially leading to system instability or other undefined behavior. On arm64, it was observed to corrupt the `priv` pointer in the same structure.
- **Attack vectors**: Configuring the fiber port of the DP83869 PHY.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be able to trigger the fiber port configuration in the driver.
