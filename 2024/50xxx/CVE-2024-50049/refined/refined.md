Based on the provided information, all of the commits fix the same vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing null pointer check before dereferencing the `se` pointer in the `dc_validate_boot_timing` and `dc_validate_seamless_boot_timing` functions within the AMD display driver. The `se` pointer is checked for null earlier in the function, which indicates it *can* be null. However, it is not checked again before using it to access a function pointer, which could result in a null pointer dereference if `se` is indeed null.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing null pointer check before accessing a function pointer through the `se` pointer.
- Potential null pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- System crash or kernel panic due to the null pointer dereference.
- Denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered if the system enters a state where the `se` pointer becomes null. This likely involves specific display configurations or modes during boot or runtime.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker doesn't necessarily need direct access to the system. The vulnerability is triggered by specific system states or configurations related to the AMD display driver, making it more of a system-level issue rather than one exploitable through a specific network or local privilege escalation attack.
- The vulnerability is not related to user input, so a specific position might not be required
- The attacker would need to trigger the display driver code path in a manner that results in `se` being null.
