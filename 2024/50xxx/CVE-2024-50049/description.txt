In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Check null pointer before dereferencing se

[WHAT & HOW]
se is null checked previously in the same function, indicating
it might be null; therefore, it must be checked when used again.

This fixes 1 FORWARD_NULL issue reported by Coverity.
