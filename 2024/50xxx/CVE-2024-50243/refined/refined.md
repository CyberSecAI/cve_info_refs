The provided content relates to a fix for a general protection fault in the `run_is_mapped_full` function and an issue with deleting a non-resident attribute in `ntfs_create_inode()` within the Linux kernel's ntfs3 filesystem driver.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from an incorrect handling of non-resident attributes, specifically ATTR_EA, during inode creation in the ntfs3 driver. The code was attempting to set the size of the attribute to zero by passing `NULL` instead of a `runs_tree` structure. This caused a general protection fault later on.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of non-resident attributes during inode creation.
- Incorrect usage of the `attr_set_size` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A general protection fault/crash due to incorrect memory access when handling the non-resident attribute.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when creating a new file or directory on an NTFS volume that contains an extended attribute (`ATTR_EA`) and has reparse point. The file system needs to have non-resident extended attributes for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create files on a mounted ntfs3 filesystem, specifically triggering the `ntfs_create_inode` function.
