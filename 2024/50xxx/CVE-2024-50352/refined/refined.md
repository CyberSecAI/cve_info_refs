Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-50352

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the application's failure to sanitize the "name" parameter when creating a service through the "edit device -> services" workflow before outputting it in the HTML of the "Services" section of the Device Overview page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' sessions when they visit the "Services" section of the device's overview page.
- This could result in the compromise of user accounts and enable unauthorized actions on their behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a network request.
- The attacker injects the XSS payload into the "name" parameter of a service when creating/editing it via the "edit device -> services" workflow (e.g., "/device/15/edit/section=services").

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with privileges to edit device services.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the device editing interface.
- The attacker needs to craft and inject a malicious payload as a service "name" parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specifically located in `librenms/includes/html/pages/device/overview/services.inc.php`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when viewing the "Services" section of a device's "Overview" page after a crafted service has been added.
- The vulnerability does not exist when creating services through the "Add Service" interface (ajax\_form.php).
- A sample POST request is provided in the advisory.
- The fix commit `b4af778` addresses the vulnerability by applying `htmlentities` encoding on service `name` and `type`.
- The vulnerability was reported by RaphaelCSS and found by RaphaelCSSilva.
- The CVSS score is 7.5/10, classified as High severity.
- The affected versions are <= 24.9.1 and the patched version is 24.10.0
