Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `printtool.php` file of the Itsourcecode Construction Management System. This occurs because the application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `borrow_id` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to insert arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
    - This may lead to sensitive data disclosure, data manipulation, data deletion, or other forms of database compromise.
    - In the provided exploit steps, an attacker can dump the database schema and contents.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `printtool.php` file.
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** Specifically, the `borrow_id` parameter within the URL is manipulated to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **No Authentication Required for Injection:** The injection is possible without prior authentication to the application, though the steps provided do specify how to login. However, the vulnerability itself exists regardless of any login.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content includes steps for manual exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability, and using SQLmap for further exploitation and database dumping.
- The vendor of the product is Itsourcecode.
- The affected version of the software is version 1.0 of the Construction Management System.
