# VULNERABILTIES SUMMARY DESCRIPTION

This is a public reference that contains the minimum require information for the vulnerability covered by CVE-2024-50920, CVE-2024-50921, CVE-2024-50924, CVE-2024-50928, CVE-2024-50929, CVE-2024-50930, CVE-2024-50931.

The details for each CVE-2024-\*\*\*\*\* are provided at the end of this document.

### Vulnerability description

Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities in Z-Wave chipsets. These vulnerabilities may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to inject malicious packets to the Z-Wave controller to cause DoS.

### CVSS Severity: High

### Discoverer

Thanks to Carlos Kayembe Nkuba, Jimin Kang, Professor Seunghoon Woo, and Professor Heejo Lee from Korea University for reporting these vulnerabilities.

### Additional Information

With the use of tools and transceivers that can decode Z-Wave frame( e.g., Scapy-radio with HackRF One;
Yard Stick One; RFCat ; RTL-SDR; Zniffer with Sigma UZB) an attacker sniffs and captures any Z-Wave
communication of a target Z-Wave smart home.
Then he retrieves the Z-Wave HomeID and NodeID of devices that are transmiting packets in the network.
With the knowledge of the HomeID, the attacker can brute force the Z-Wave network to know all remaining
available smart devices in the network. This is achieved by sending to all possible Z-Wave node (2 to 232)
either these Z-Wave frames: No Operation (NOP), SWITCH\_BINARY\_GET, or Node Information (NIF), SECURITY\_NONCE\_GET,
SECURITY\_2\_NONCE\_GET to get the acknowledgement (ACK) from devices.

From this ACK the attacker retrieves the node ID of devices that responded and their capabilities.

With the knowledge of the Z-Wave HomeID and NodeID of the device, the attacker crafts a malicious packet with a desired malicious payload and sends it to the target Z-Wave device by using a customized Z-Wave packet management software and hardware such as HackRF One, Yard Stick One, RFCat, or CC1110.

The controller will accept and validate the malicious packet, which cause a DoS. These attacks are critical because they render the Z-Wave controller vulnerable to DoS attacks, which make their service inaccessible to authentic smart home users.

### How does an attacker exploit this vulnerability?

Attacker and target device need to be within a range of 40 to 100 meters.
The range can be increased by using an advanced Software-Defined Radio (SDR) hardware.

### What is the impact of this vulnerability?

Denial of service (DoS) on Z-Wave controller.

### Vendor of Product

Silicon Labs ( SiLabs)

### Affected Product Code Base

Z Wave controllers with Silicon Labs Chipset

### Attack Type

Proximate remote attack

### Impact Denial of Service

Denial of Service on the controller.

### Attack Vectors

By crafting a malicious Z-Wave packet and sending it to the Z-Wave controller and devices.
