The provided document contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2024-50930.

**CVE-2024-50930**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure permissions in the Silicon Labs Z-Wave Series 500 SDK.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability stems from how the Z-Wave controller handles the NEW NODE REGISTERED command class, specifically within Silicon Labs Z-Wave Series 500 devices running SDK v6.84.0 and earlier.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can cause a DoS by injecting malicious packets, leading to the controller being unable to add new valid devices. This is achieved by adding up to 235 rogue/fake devices into the controller's memory.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The description indicates that the vulnerability could lead to the execution of arbitrary code, though the specifics of how this code execution is achieved are not clearly detailed.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack involves sending crafted, malformed Z-Wave packets, specifically using the NEW NODE REGISTERED command class.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within a range of 40 to 100 meters of the target device, although this range can be increased using advanced Software-Defined Radio (SDR) hardware. The attacker also needs the ability to sniff, capture and craft Z-Wave communication packets. Knowledge of the target Z-Wave network's HomeID is necessary to conduct the attack.
