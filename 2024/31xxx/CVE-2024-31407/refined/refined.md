- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled search path in the Intel High Level Synthesis Compiler software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The software does not properly control the paths it searches, leading to potential vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user can potentially escalate their privileges through local access.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system. They also need to interact with the software (User Interaction Required). The attack complexity is high.
