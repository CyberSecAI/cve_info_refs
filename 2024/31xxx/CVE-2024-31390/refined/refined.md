{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Breakdance page builder plugin for WordPress allows users with 'Edit Content' permissions to execute arbitrary PHP code due to insufficient access control.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
      "Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
      "Injection vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete site takeover, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious code within the 'Edit Content' interface of the Breakdance plugin.",
     "Specifically, by injecting PHP code into the 'parentPropertiesJsonString' variable and using 'EssentialElements\\CodeBlock' as the elementSlug, the eval function will execute the malicious code."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs a user account with 'Edit Content' privileges within the Breakdance plugin. This is the lowest permission level within the builder that allows content editing."
  },
  "affected_components": [
    {
      "name": "Breakdance plugin for WordPress",
      "versions": "<= 1.7.2"
    }
  ],
   "additional_notes": [
    "The vendor initially denied the vulnerability, claiming it was intended functionality.",
     "The vulnerability is triggered when a user with 'Edit Content' access modifies the page content with malicious code.",
     "The vulnerability can be triggered by the administrator visiting the front end page where malicious code is stored",
     "The vulnerability is present due to the use of the eval() function to execute user-supplied PHP code.",
      "Patchstack issued a virtual patch to mitigate the vulnerability, but an official fix from the vendor is still needed.",
      "The vulnerability is also present in the Oxygen Builder plugin using a different code path but similar weak access control practices."
