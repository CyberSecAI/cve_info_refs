Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Binance app's failure to invalidate or disable fingerprint authentication when a new fingerprint is added to the user's device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The core issue is that the fingerprint authentication mechanism doesn't properly account for changes in the device's biometric data. Specifically, the application does not invalidate the existing authentication upon the addition of a new fingerprint.
*   **Bypass Authentication:** This oversight allows an attacker who has added their own fingerprint to the device to bypass the intended security measure and gain unauthorized access to the app.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain access to the user's Binance account by adding their own fingerprint and using it to bypass the authentication.
*   **Potential for Financial Loss:** With unauthorized access, attackers could potentially transfer funds, perform trades, or access sensitive user information within the Binance account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Device Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the user's device to add a new fingerprint in the device's settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Device Access:** The attacker must have physical control over the user's device long enough to add a new fingerprint to the device's biometric settings.
*   **No prior knowledge of current fingerprints** The attacker does not need to know which fingerprints are currently registered on the device

**Additional Details**
* The content explicitly mentions the fix is to use "setInvalidatedByBiometricEnrollment" API of the key used in fingerprint authentication
