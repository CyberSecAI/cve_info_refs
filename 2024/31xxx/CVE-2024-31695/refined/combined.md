# Incorrect Access Control in the Fingerprint Authentication Mechanism of "Binance: Buy Bitcoin & Crypto" App

Nov 12, 2024

## Affected version

2.85.4

## Vulnerability description

The following vulnerability exists in the implementation of the fingerprint authentication function of this app.

1. Failure to disable the fingerprint function when a new fingerprint is added to the device, allowing an attacker to pass fingerprint authentication by entering a new fingerprint, which can lead to unauthorized access.

## Improvement suggestion

1. Disable fingerprint authentication when a new fingerprint is recognized on the device, prompt the user when he/she performs fingerprint authentication, and require the user to complete the authentication by other means. In terms of implementation, this can be done by using the “setInvalidatedByBiometricEnrollment” API of the key used in fingerprint authentication.
