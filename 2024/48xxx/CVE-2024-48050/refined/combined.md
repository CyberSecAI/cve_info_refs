|  | ### CVE-2024-48050: Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution via eval in agentscope <= v0.0.4 |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | ### Description |
|  |  |
|  | In agentscope version <= v0.0.4, located at `agentscope\web\workstation\workflow\_utils.py`, there is a security vulnerability in the function `is\_callable\_expression`. This function includes a line, `result = eval(s)`, which presents a high risk, as it allows direct execution of user-provided commands. Without proper sanitization, this eval statement can enable attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely by manipulating input passed to the function. |
|  |  |
|  | ### Vulnerability Type |
|  |  |
|  | - Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution via eval |
|  |  |
|  | ### Affected Product Code Base |
|  |  |
|  | - agentscope <= v0.0.4 (latest) |
|  |  |
|  | ### Affected Component |
|  |  |
|  | - The `is\_callable\_expression` function within `agentscope\web\workstation\workflow\_utils.py`, where the line `result = eval(s)` poses a security risk due to unsanitized input. |
|  |  |
|  | ### Attack Type |
|  |  |
|  | - Remote |
|  |  |
|  | ### Impact |
|  |  |
|  | - Code Execution |
|  |  |
|  | ### Attack Vectors |
|  |  |
|  | - Potential attack vectors include crafted data payloads targeting the |
|  |  |
|  | ``` |
|  | is\_callable\_expression |
|  | ``` |
|  |  |
|  | function, such as: |
|  |  |
|  | ``` |
|  | json复制代码{ |

|  | "inputs": { |
|  | "input\_1": { |
|  | "connections": [] |

|  | }, |
|  | "name": "WhileLoopPipeline", |
|  | "outputs": { |
