{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `is_callable_expression` function in `agentscope/web/workstation/workflow/_utils.py` uses `eval(s)` on user-provided input `s` without proper sanitization, allowing direct execution of arbitrary code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution due to the use of `eval()` on unsanitized user input.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted data payloads targeting the `is_callable_expression` function. An example payload is provided.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can send malicious input to the vulnerable function, without needing authentication."
