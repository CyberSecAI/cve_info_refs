you can convert EPUB files to PDF using converters like [Wondershare PDFelement](https://pdf.wondershare.com/) to make them readable in a PDF reader.

How do I increase font size in PDF for free?

Several methods are available to increase the font size in a PDF for free.

These methods provide free and convenient ways to increase the font size in a PDF.

Does Chromebook have a PDF viewer?

[Sumatra PDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader) is widely considered a good PDF reader, especially if you want a lightweight, fast, and user-friendly option. Here are some reasons why itâs popular:
