The install() function of ProviderInstaller.java in Magisk App before canary version 27007 does not verify the GMS app before loading it, which allows a local untrusted app with no additional privileges to silently execute arbitrary code in the Magisk app and escalate privileges to root via a crafted package, aka Bug #8279. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.
