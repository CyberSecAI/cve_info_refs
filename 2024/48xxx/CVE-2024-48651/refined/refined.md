  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of supplemental group inheritance in ProFTPD when using mod_sql. Specifically, when a user authenticates with a method that doesn't provide supplemental groups (like SQLAuthenticate users), the process incorrectly retains the parent process's supplemental GID, which can be GID 0 (root). This is caused by the removal of code intended to overwrite supplemental group memberships when configured to run as non-root, related to a fix for issue #808.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect supplemental group inheritance",
        "Lack of proper sanitization of supplemental GIDs when using mod_sql",
        "Retention of parent process's supplemental groups in child processes"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to files and directories owned by the root group.  Specifically, a user authenticating via mod_sql without specified supplemental groups will inherit supplemental group ID 0 (root), thus potentially overwriting files owned by root, or reading files owned by root with specific permissions.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access to the ProFTPD server."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the ProFTPD server via a mechanism that does not explicitly provide supplemental groups, such as SQL authentication, and target a vulnerable version of proftpd with this setup.  No user interaction is required."
