Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-48292

**Root Cause:**
The `wssrvc.exe` service in Quick Heal Antivirus Pro and Quick Heal Total Security attempts to connect to a named pipe (`\\.\Pipe\pipe_quickup`) without proper validation. This lack of validation allows an attacker to create a malicious named pipe and impersonate the legitimate service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of named pipe connections.
- The `wssrvc.exe` service runs with `NT AUTHORITY\System` privileges, making it a highly desirable target for privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation to `NT AUTHORITY\System`.
- The attacker can then perform any action on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker must have a local user account.
- Attacker needs the `SeImpersonatePrivilege` to impersonate the service.

**Technical Details:**
- The `wssrvc.exe` service constantly tries to connect to the named pipe `\\.\Pipe\pipe_quickup`.
- An attacker can create a server pipe with the same name.
- When `wssrvc.exe` tries to connect, the attacker can impersonate the client (i.e `wssrvc.exe` )
- This impersonation provides the attacker with `NT AUTHORITY\System` privileges.
- The provided PoC demonstrates a proof of concept attack for this vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
- QuickHeal Antivirus Pro v24.0
- Quick Heal Total Security v24.0

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability lies in the insecure use of named pipes and lack of validation in the Quick Heal software.
- The provided content includes links to Quick Heal's website, and mentions their security practices, but this information does not directly describe the vulnerability itself.
- It also includes general information about GitHub Copilot and its security features which are unrelated to the vulnerability.
