Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-48217

**Root Cause:**
* The vulnerability is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) within the SiSMART v7.4.0 application's dashboard. The application uses data stored in the browser's local storage (specifically `sekolah_kode`, `user_id`, and `user_level`) to determine user privileges without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application uses user-supplied data from the browser's local storage to directly access objects and resources without proper validation or authorization. Specifically, the `sekolah_kode`, `user_id`, and `user_level` parameters are directly used to determine access rights.
*   **Lack of Proper Authentication/Authorization:** The application does not verify the validity of the data stored in local storage, allowing an attacker to manipulate these values to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Reliance on Client-Side Data for Authorization:** The application trusts the data stored in local storage for user authentication and authorization, which is inherently insecure since client-side data can be easily manipulated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Horizontal Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain access to another user's account or data by modifying the `sekolah_kode` and `user_id` parameters in the local storage.
*   **Potentially Vertical Privilege Escalation:** By modifying the `user_level` parameter, an attacker might be able to elevate their privileges to those of an administrator, gaining full control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker can intercept the HTTP response from the server and inject malicious JavaScript to modify the local storage before the application renders the page.
*   **Local Browser Manipulation:** An attacker could directly manipulate the browser's local storage using browser development tools or extensions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP responses or have access to the victim's browser.
*   The attacker must also know or be able to guess the format and valid values for `sekolah_kode`, `user_id`, and `user_level`.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit involves modifying the browser's local storage to set:
    *   `sekolah_kode` to a target school's code.
    *   `user_id` to a target user's ID.
    *   `user_level` to 'administrator' or other desired role
    *   `id_token` to 'undefined'
*   This modification is done by injecting a script into the HTTP response that sets the local storage items and then redirects the browser to `/sekolah`.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Implement Proper Access Controls:**  The application must perform proper authentication and authorization checks on the server-side before granting access to any resources.
*   **Validate Input:** Server-side validation of parameters like `sekolah_kode`, `user_id`, and `user_level` should be implemented to ensure they are valid and authorized for the requesting user.
*   **Do Not Rely on Client-Side Data:** Avoid using client-side data for authentication or authorization purposes. Instead, store user session information securely on the server.
*   **Use Secure Identifiers:** Implement unique, non-guessable identifiers, such as UUIDs, for objects instead of incremental IDs, to make IDOR attacks more difficult.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content includes a detailed step-by-step procedure for reproducing the vulnerability.
*  The content also references additional resources, including blog posts and OWASP cheat sheets on IDOR vulnerabilities.
* The Tenable description indicates the CVSS v3 base score is 8.8, with a High severity rating, reflecting the serious potential impact of this vulnerability.
