- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input provided via the `searchkey` parameter in the `/admin/search-result.php` page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly encode or validate user input, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim's browser. This could result in session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious sites, among other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to the `/admin/search-result.php` page with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `searchkey` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable application and needs to know the path to the vulnerable script. The attacker can be unauthenticated, as there is no mention of any login requirements to reach the vulnerable page.
