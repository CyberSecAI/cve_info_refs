|  | ### CVE-2024-48057: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and CSRF in LocalAI <= 2.20.1 |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | ### Description |
|  |  |
|  | LocalAI version <= 2.20.1 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). When calling the delete model API and passing inappropriate parameters, it can lead to a one-time storage XSS vulnerability. This payload is stored temporarily and triggers when a user accesses the homepage. The combination of storage XSS with CSRF exposure presents significant security risks, as attackers may inject malicious scripts or perform unauthorized actions by exploiting both vulnerabilities. |
|  |  |
|  | ### Vulnerability Type |
|  |  |
|  | - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) |
|  | - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) |
|  |  |
|  | ### Vendor of Product |
|  |  |
|  | - https://github.com/mudler/localai |
|  |  |
|  | ### Affected Product Code Base |
|  |  |
|  | - LocalAI <= 2.20.1 |
|  |  |
|  | ### Affected Component |
|  |  |
|  | - The delete model API in LocalAI, where improper parameter handling leads to a one-time storage XSS and CSRF vulnerability, with the payload executed upon accessing the homepage. |
|  |  |
|  | ### Attack Type |
|  |  |
|  | - Remote |
|  |  |
|  | ### Impact |
|  |  |
|  | - Code Execution, Unauthorized Requests |
|  |  |
|  | ### Attack Vectors |
|  |  |
|  | - The attack involves exploiting the delete model API by passing improper parameters, causing the injection of a storage XSS payload that will activate upon a user's access to the homepage. |
