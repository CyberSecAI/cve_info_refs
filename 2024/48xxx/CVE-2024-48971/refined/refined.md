{
  "CVE-2024-48971": {
    "Root cause": "The Clinician Password and Serial Number Clinician Password are hard-coded into the ventilator in plaintext form.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of Hard-Coded Credentials (CWE-798)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could obtain the password off the ventilator and use it to gain unauthorized access to the device, with clinician privileges. This could lead to information disclosure and/or disruption of the device's function.",
    "Attack vectors": "Physical access to the ventilator is required to extract the hardcoded credentials.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs physical access to the device in order to extract the hardcoded credentials. The attacker also needs to be able to use the extracted credentials to log in to the device."
