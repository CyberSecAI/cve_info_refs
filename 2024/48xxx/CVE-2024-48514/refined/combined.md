# Dependency Scanning

**Tier:** Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

Dependency Scanning analyzes your application‚Äôs dependencies for known vulnerabilities. All
dependencies are scanned, including transitive dependencies, also known as nested dependencies.

Dependency Scanning is often considered part of Software Composition Analysis (SCA). SCA can contain
aspects of inspecting the items your code uses. These items typically include application and system
dependencies that are almost always imported from external sources, rather than sourced from items
you wrote yourself.

Dependency Scanning can run in the development phase of your application‚Äôs lifecycle. Every time a
pipeline runs, vulnerabilities are identified and compared between the source and target branches.
Vulnerabilities and their severity are listed in the merge request, enabling you to proactively
address the risk to your application, before the code change is committed.
Vulnerabilities can also be identified outside a pipeline by
[Continuous Vulnerability Scanning](../continuous_vulnerability_scanning/index.html).

GitLab offers both Dependency Scanning and [Container Scanning](../container_scanning/index.html) to
ensure coverage for all of these dependency types. To cover as much of your risk area as possible,
we encourage you to use all of our security scanners. For a comparison of these features, see
[Dependency Scanning compared to Container Scanning](../comparison_dependency_and_container_scanning.html).

1. Java 21 LTS for [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) is limited to version 1.9.7. Support for more [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) versions can be tracked in [issue 430335](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/430335).
   It is not supported when [FIPS mode](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fips_compliance.html#enable-fips-mode) is enabled.- Gradle is not supported when [FIPS mode](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fips_compliance.html#enable-fips-mode) is enabled.- Support for `pnpm` lockfiles was [introduced in GitLab 15.11](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/336809). `pnpm` lockfiles do not store bundled dependencies, so the reported dependencies may differ from `npm` or `yarn`.- Support for [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) projects with a `poetry.lock` file was [added in GitLab 15.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/7006).
         Support for projects without a `poetry.lock` file is tracked in issue:
         [Poetry's pyproject.toml support for dependency scanning.](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/32774)- Support for sbt 1.0.x was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/415835) in GitLab 16.8 and [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/436985) in GitLab 17.0.- Support for Maven below 3.8.8 was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/438772) in GitLab 16.9 and will be removed in GitLab 17.0.- Support for prior Python versions was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/441201) in GitLab 16.9 and [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/441491) in GitLab 17.0.- Excludes both `pip` and `setuptools` from the report as they are required by the installer.- Only SBOM, without advisories. See [spike on CocoaPods advisories research](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/468764).

## Dependency detection

Dependency Scanning automatically detects the languages used in the repository. All analyzers
matching the detected languages are run. There is usually no need to customize the selection of
analyzers. We recommend not specifying the analyzers so you automatically use the full selection for
best coverage, avoiding the need to make adjustments when there are deprecations or removals.
However, you can override the selection using the variable `DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS`.

The language detection relies on CI job [`rules`](../../../ci/yaml/index.html#rules) and searches a
maximum of two directory levels from the repository‚Äôs root. For example, the
`gemnasium-dependency_scanning` job is enabled if a repository contains either `Gemfile`,
`api/Gemfile`, or `api/client/Gemfile`, but not if the only supported dependency file is
`api/v1/client/Gemfile`.

For Java and Python, when a supported dependency file is detected, Dependency Scanning attempts to
build the project and execute some Java or Python commands to get the list of dependencies. For all
other projects, the lock file is parsed to obtain the list of dependencies without needing to build
the project first.

When a supported dependency file is detected, all dependencies, including transitive dependencies
are analyzed. There is no limit to the depth of nested or transitive dependencies that are analyzed.
### Analyzers

Dependency Scanning supports the following official
[Gemnasium-based](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) analyzers:

* `gemnasium`* `gemnasium-maven`* `gemnasium-python`

The analyzers are published as Docker images, which Dependency Scanning uses to launch dedicated
containers for each analysis. You can also integrate a custom
[security scanner](../../../development/integrations/secure.html).

Each analyzer is updated as new versions of Gemnasium are released. For more information, see the
analyzer [Release Process documentation](../../../development/sec/analyzer_development_guide.html#versioning-and-release-process).
### How analyzers obtain dependency information

GitLab analyzers obtain dependency information using one of the following two methods:

1. [Parsing lockfiles directly.](#obtaining-dependency-information-by-parsing-lockfiles)- [Running a package manager or build tool to generate a dependency information file which is then parsed.](#obtaining-dependency-information-by-running-a-package-manager-to-generate-a-parsable-file)

#### Obtaining dependency information by parsing lockfiles

The following package managers use lockfiles that GitLab analyzers are capable of parsing directly:

| Package Manager Supported File Format Versions Tested Package Manager Versions| Bundler Not applicable [1.17.3](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/qa/fixtures/ruby-bundler/default/Gemfile.lock#L118), [2.1.4](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/ruby-bundler/-/blob/bundler2-FREEZE/Gemfile.lock#L118)| Composer Not applicable [1.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/qa/fixtures/php-composer/default/composer.lock)| Conan 0.4 [1.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/qa/fixtures/c-conan/default/conan.lock#L38)| Go Not applicable [1.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/qa/fixtures/go-modules/gosum/default/go.sum)| NuGet v1, v2**[1](#notes-regarding-parsing-lockfiles-1)** [4.9](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/qa/fixtures/csharp-nuget-dotnetcore/default/src/web.api/packages.lock.json#L2)| npm v1, v2, v3**[2](#notes-regarding-parsing-lockfiles-2)** [6.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/qa/fixtures/js-npm/default/package-lock.json#L4), [7.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/qa/fixtures/js-npm/lockfileVersion2/package-lock.json#L4), [9.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/scanner/parser/npm/fixtures/lockfile-v3/simple/package-lock.json#L4)| pnpm v5, v6, v9 [7.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/qa/fixtures/js-pnpm/default/pnpm-lock.yaml#L1), [8.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/scanner/parser/pnpm/fixtures/v6/simple/pnpm-lock.yaml#L1) [9.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/scanner/parser/pnpm/fixtures/v9/simple/pnpm-lock.yaml#L1)| yarn versions 1, 2, 3, 4**[3](#notes-regarding-parsing-lockfiles-3)** [1.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/qa/fixtures/js-yarn/classic/default/yarn.lock#L2), [2.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/qa/fixtures/js-yarn/berry/v2/default/yarn.lock), [3.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/qa/fixtures/js-yarn/berry/v3/default/yarn.lock)| Poetry v1 [1.x](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/master/qa/fixtures/python-poetry/default/poetry.lock) | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | |

1. Support for NuGet version 2 lock files was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/398680) in GitLab 16.2.- Support for `lockfileVersion = 3` was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/365176) in GitLab 15.7.- Support for Yarn version 4 was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/431752) in GitLab 16.11.

       The following features are not supported for Yarn Berry:
       * [workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces)* [yarn patch](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/patch)

       Yarn files that contain a patch, a workspace, or both, are still processed, but these features are ignored.

#### Obtaining dependency information by running a package manager to generate a parsable file

To support the following package managers, the GitLab analyzers proceed in two steps:

1. Execute the package manager or a specific task, to export the dependency information.- Parse the exported dependency information.

1. This test uses the default version of `maven` specified by the [`.tool-versions`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/blob/v5.2.14/build/gemnasium-maven/debian/config/.tool-versions#L3) file.- Different versions of Java require different versions of Gradle. The versions of Gradle listed in the above table are pre-installed
     in the analyzer image. The version of Gradle used by the analyzer depends on whether your project uses a `gradlew`
     (Gradle wrapper) file or not:
     * If your project *does not use* a `gradlew` file, then the analyzer automatically switches to one of the
       pre-installed Gradle versions, based on the version of Java specified by the
       [`DS_JAVA_VERSION`](#analyzer-specific-settings) variable (default version is `17`).

       For Java versions `8` and `11`, Gradle `6.7.1` is automatically selected, Java `17` uses Gradle `7.6.4`, and Java `21` uses Gradle `8.8`.* If your project *does use* a `gradlew` file, then the version of Gradle pre-installed in the analyzer image is
         ignored, and the version specified in your `gradlew` file is used instead.- This test confirms that if a `Pipfile.lock` file is found, it is used by [Gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) to scan the exact package versions listed in this file.- Because of the implementation of `go build`, the Go build process requires network access, a pre-loaded mod cache via `go mod download`, or vendored dependencies. For more information,
         refer to the Go documentation on [compiling packages and dependencies](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Compile_packages_and_dependencies).

### How analyzers are triggered

GitLab relies on [`rules:exists`](../../../ci/yaml/index.html#rulesexists) to start the relevant analyzers for the languages detected by the presence of the
`Supported files` in the repository as shown in the [table above](#supported-languages-and-package-managers).

The current detection logic limits the maximum search depth to two levels. For example, the `gemnasium-dependency_scanning` job is enabled if
a repository contains either a `Gemfile.lock`, `api/Gemfile.lock`, or `api/client/Gemfile.lock`, but not if the only supported dependency file is `api/v1/client/Gemfile.lock`.

When a supported dependency file is detected, all dependencies, including transitive dependencies are analyzed. There is no limit to the depth of nested or transitive dependencies that are analyzed.
### How multiple files are processed

noteIf you‚Äôve run into problems while scanning multiple files, contribute a comment to
[this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337056).
#### Python

We only execute one installation in the directory where either a requirements file or a lock file has been detected. Dependencies are only analyzed by `gemnasium-python` for the first file that is detected. Files are searched for in the following order:

1. `requirements.txt`, `requirements.pip`, or `requires.txt` for projects using Pip.- `Pipfile` or `Pipfile.lock` for projects using Pipenv.- `poetry.lock` for projects using Poetry.- `setup.py` for project using Setuptools.

The search begins with the root directory and then continues with subdirectories if no builds are found in the root directory. Consequently a Poetry lock file in the root directory would be detected before a Pipenv file in a subdirectory.
#### Java and Scala

We only execute one build in the directory where a build file has been detected. For large projects that include
multiple Gradle, Maven, or sbt builds, or any combination of these, `gemnasium-maven` only analyzes dependencies for the first build file
that is detected. Build files are searched for in the following order:

1. `pom.xml` for single or [multi-module](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Aggregation) Maven projects.- `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` for single or [multi-project](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/intro_multi_project_builds.html) Gradle builds.- `build.sbt` for single or [multi-project](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Multi-Project.html) sbt builds.

The search begins with the root directory and then continues with subdirectories if no builds are found in the root directory. Consequently an sbt build file in the root directory would be detected before a Gradle build file in a subdirectory.
#### JavaScript

The following analyzers are executed, each of which have different behavior when processing multiple files:

* [Gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium)

  Supports multiple lockfiles* [Retire.js](https://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/)

    Does not support multiple lockfiles. When multiple lockfiles exist, `Retire.js`
    analyzes the first lockfile discovered while traversing the directory tree in alphabetical order.

The `gemnasium` analyzer scans supports JavaScript projects for vendored libraries
(that is, those checked into the project but not managed by the package manager).
#### Go

Multiple files are supported. When a `go.mod` file is detected, the analyzer attempts to generate a [build list](https://go.dev/ref/mod#glos-build-list) using
[Minimal Version Selection](https://go.dev/ref/mod#glos-minimal-version-selection). If this fails, the analyzer instead attempts to parse the dependencies within the `go.mod` file.

As a requirement, the `go.mod` file should be cleaned up using the command `go mod tidy` to ensure proper management of dependencies. The process is repeated for every detected `go.mod` file.
#### PHP, C, C++, .NET, C#, Ruby, JavaScript

The analyzer for these languages supports multiple lockfiles.
#### Support for additional languages

Support for additional languages, dependency managers, and dependency files are tracked in the following issues:

| Package Managers Languages Supported files Scan tools Issue| [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) Python `pyproject.toml` [Gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) [GitLab#32774](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/32774) | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Configuration

Enable the dependency scanning analyzer to ensure it scans your application‚Äôs dependencies for known
vulnerabilities. You can then adjust its behavior by using CI/CD variables.
### Enabling the analyzer

Prerequisites:

* The `test` stage is required in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.* With self-managed runners you need a GitLab Runner with the
    [`docker`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html) or
    [`kubernetes`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/kubernetes.html) executor.* If you‚Äôre using SaaS runners on GitLab.com, this is enabled by default.

To enable the analyzer, either:

* Enable [Auto DevOps](../../../topics/autodevops/index.html), which includes dependency scanning.* Use a preconfigured merge request.* Create a [scan execution policy](../policies/scan_execution_policies.html) that enforces dependency
      scanning.* Edit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file manually.* [Use CI/CD components](#use-cicd-components)

#### Use a preconfigured merge request

This method automatically prepares a merge request that includes the Dependency Scanning template
in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. You then merge the merge request to enable Dependency Scanning.
noteThis method works best with no existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, or with a minimal configuration file.
If you have a complex GitLab configuration file it might not be parsed successfully, and an error
might occur. In that case, use the [manual](#edit-the-gitlab-ciyml-file-manually) method instead.

To enable Dependency Scanning:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.- Select **Secure > Security configuration**.- In the **Dependency Scanning** row, select **Configure with a merge request**.- Select **Create merge request**.- Review the merge request, then select **Merge**.

Pipelines now include a Dependency Scanning job.
#### Edit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file manually

This method requires you to manually edit the existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. Use this method if
your GitLab CI/CD configuration file is complex.

To enable Dependency Scanning:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.- Select **Build > Pipeline editor**.- If no `.gitlab-ci.yml` file exists, select **Configure pipeline**, then delete the example
       content.- Copy and paste the following to the bottom of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. If an `include` line
         already exists, add only the `template` line below it.
         ```
         include:
           - template: Jobs/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

         ```
          - Select the **Validate** tab, then select **Validate pipeline**.

           The message **Simulation completed successfully** confirms the file is valid.- Select the **Edit** tab.- Complete the fields. Do not use the default branch for the **Branch** field.- Select the **Start a new merge request with these changes** checkbox, then select **Commit
                 changes**.- Complete the fields according to your standard workflow, then select **Create
                   merge request**.- Review and edit the merge request according to your standard workflow, then select **Merge**.

Pipelines now include a Dependency Scanning job.
#### Use CI/CD components

**History**

* [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/454143) in GitLab 17.0. This feature is an [experiment](../../../policy/development_stages_support.html).* The dependency scanning CI/CD component only supports Android projects.

Use [CI/CD components](../../../ci/components/index.html) to perform Dependency Scanning of your
application. For instructions, see the respective component‚Äôs README file.
##### Available CI/CD components

See <https://gitlab.com/explore/catalog/components/dependency-scanning>
### Running jobs in merge request pipelines

See [Use security scanning tools with merge request pipelines](../detect/roll_out_security_scanning.html#use-security-scanning-tools-with-merge-request-pipelines)
### Customizing analyzer behavior

To customize Dependency Scanning, use [CI/CD variables](#available-cicd-variables).
cautionTest all customization of GitLab analyzers in a merge request before merging these changes to the
default branch. Failure to do so can give unexpected results, including a large number of false
positives.
### Overriding dependency scanning jobs

To override a job definition (for example, to change properties like `variables` or `dependencies`),
declare a new job with the same name as the one to override. Place this new job after the template
inclusion and specify any additional keys under it. For example, this disables `DS_REMEDIATE` for
the `gemnasium` analyzer:
```
include:
  - template: Jobs/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

gemnasium-dependency_scanning:
  variables:
    DS_REMEDIATE: "false"

```

To override the `dependencies: []` attribute, add an override job as above, targeting this attribute:
```
include:
  - template: Jobs/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

gemnasium-dependency_scanning:
  dependencies: ["build"]

```
### Available CI/CD variables

You can use CI/CD variables to [customize](#customizing-analyzer-behavior) dependency scanning behavior.
#### Global analyzer settings

The following variables allow configuration of global dependency scanning settings.

| CI/CD variables Description| `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` Bundle of CA certificates to trust. The bundle of certificates provided here is also used by other tools during the scanning process, such as `git`, `yarn`, or `npm`. For more details, see [Custom TLS certificate authority](#custom-tls-certificate-authority).| `DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS` Specify the analyzers (by name) to exclude from Dependency Scanning. For more information, see [Analyzers](#analyzers).| `DS_EXCLUDED_PATHS` Exclude files and directories from the scan based on the paths. A comma-separated list of patterns. Patterns can be globs (see [`doublestar.Match`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar/v4%40v4.0.2#Match) for supported patterns), or file or folder paths (for example, `doc,spec`). Parent directories also match patterns. This is a pre-filter which is applied *before* the scan is executed. Default: `"spec, test, tests, tmp"`.| `DS_IMAGE_SUFFIX` Suffix added to the image name. (GitLab team members can view more information in this confidential issue: `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/354796`). Automatically set to `"-fips"` when FIPS mode is enabled.| `DS_MAX_DEPTH` Defines how many directory levels deep that the analyzer should search for supported files to scan. A value of `-1` scans all directories regardless of depth. Default: `2`.| `SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX` Override the name of the Docker registry providing the official default images (proxy). | | | | | | | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

This functionality requires a JavaScript lockfile to be present in a commit, otherwise Dependency Scanning is not executed and vendored files are not scanned.Dependency scanning uses the [Retire.js](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js) scanner to detect a limited set of vulnerabilities. For details of which vulnerabilities are detected, see the [Retire.js repository](https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js/blob/master/repository/jsrepository.json).| `DS_INCLUDE_DEV_DEPENDENCIES` `gemnasium` `"true"` When set to `"false"`, development dependencies and their vulnerabilities are not reported.

#### Other variables

The previous tables are not an exhaustive list of all variables that can be used. They contain all specific GitLab and analyzer variables we support and test. There are many variables, such as environment variables, that you can pass in and they do work. This is a large list, many of which we may be unaware of, and as such is not documented.

For example, to pass the non-GitLab environment variable `HTTPS_PROXY` to all Dependency Scanning jobs,
set it as a [CI/CD variable in your `.gitlab-ci.yml`](../../../ci/variables/index.html#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-gitlab-ciyml-file)
file like this:
```
variables:
  HTTPS_PROXY: "https://squid-proxy:3128"

```

noteGradle projects require [an additional variable](#using-a-proxy-with-gradle-projects) setup to use a proxy.

Alternatively we may use it in specific jobs, like Dependency Scanning:
```
dependency_scanning:
  variables:
    HTTPS_PROXY: $HTTPS_PROXY

```

As we have not tested all variables you may find some do work and others do not.
If one does not work and you need it we suggest
[submitting a feature request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Feature%20proposal%20-%20detailed&issue[title]=Docs%20feedback%20-%20feature%20proposal:%20Write%20your%20title)
or [contributing to the code](../../../development/index.html) to enable it to be used.
### Custom TLS certificate authority

Dependency Scanning allows for use of custom TLS certificates for SSL/TLS connections instead of the
default shipped with the analyzer container image.

Support for custom certificate authorities was introduced in the following versions.

| Analyzer Version| `gemnasium` [v2.8.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/releases/v2.8.0)| `gemnasium-maven` [v2.9.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-maven/-/releases/v2.9.0)| `gemnasium-python` [v2.7.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium-python/-/releases/v2.7.0) | | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

#### Using a custom TLS certificate authority

To use a custom TLS certificate authority, assign the
[text representation of the X.509 PEM public-key certificate](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7468#section-5.1)
to the CI/CD variable `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE`.

For example, to configure the certificate in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:
```
variables:

### Authenticate with a private Maven repository

To use a private Maven repository that requires authentication, you should store your credentials in
a CI/CD variable and reference them in your Maven settings file. Do not add the credentials to your
`.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

To authenticate with a private Maven repository:

1. Add the `MAVEN_CLI_OPTS` CI/CD variable to your
   [project‚Äôs settings](../../../ci/variables/index.html#for-a-project), setting the value to include
   your credentials.

   For example, if your username is `myuser` and the password is `verysecret`:

   | Type Key Value| Variable `MAVEN_CLI_OPTS` `--settings mysettings.xml -Drepository.password=verysecret -Drepository.user=myuser` | | | | --- | --- | --- | | | |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

   - Create a Maven settings file with your server configuration.

     For example, add the following to the settings file `mysettings.xml`. This file is referenced in
     the `MAVEN_CLI_OPTS` CI/CD variable.
     ```
     <!-- mysettings.xml -->
     <settings>
         ...
         <servers>
             <server>
                 <id>private_server</id>
                 <username>${private.username}</username>
                 <password>${private.password}</password>
             </server>
         </servers>
     </settings>

     ```

### FIPS-enabled images

**History**

* Introduced in GitLab 15.0 - Gemnasium uses FIPS-enabled images when FIPS mode is enabled.

GitLab also offers [FIPS-enabled Red Hat UBI](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image)
versions of the Gemnasium images. When FIPS mode is enabled in the GitLab instance, Gemnasium
scanning jobs automatically use the FIPS-enabled images. To manually switch to FIPS-enabled images,
set the variable `DS_IMAGE_SUFFIX` to `"-fips"`.

Dependency scanning for Gradle projects and auto-remediation for Yarn projects are not supported in FIPS mode.

FIPS-enabled images are based on RedHat‚Äôs UBI micro.
They don‚Äôt have package managers such as `dnf` or `microdnf`
so it‚Äôs not possible to install system packages at runtime.
## Output

Dependency Scanning produces the following output:

* **Dependency scanning report**: Contains details of all vulnerabilities detected in dependencies.* **CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials**: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for each supported
    lock or build file detected.

### Dependency scanning report

Dependency scanning outputs a report containing details of all vulnerabilities. The report is
processed internally and the results are shown in the UI. The report is also output as an artifact
of the dependency scanning job, named `gl-dependency-scanning-report.json`.

For more details of the dependency scanning report, see:

* [Security scanner integration](../../../development/integrations/secure.html).* [Dependency scanning report schema](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas/-/blob/master/dist/dependency-scanning-report-format.json).

### CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials

> * Generally available in GitLab 15.7.

Dependency Scanning outputs a [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
for each supported lock or build file it detects.

The CycloneDX SBOMs are:

* Named `gl-sbom-<package-type>-<package-manager>.cdx.json`.* Available as job artifacts of the dependency scanning job.* Saved in the same directory as the detected lock or build files.

For example, if your project has the following structure:
```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ruby-project/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Gemfile.lock
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ruby-project-2/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Gemfile.lock
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ php-project/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ composer.lock
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go-project/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go.sum

```

Then the Gemnasium scanner generates the following CycloneDX SBOMs:
```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ruby-project/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gemfile.lock
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gl-sbom-gem-bundler.cdx.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ruby-project-2/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gemfile.lock
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gl-sbom-gem-bundler.cdx.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ php-project/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ composer.lock
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gl-sbom-packagist-composer.cdx.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go-project/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ go.sum
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gl-sbom-go-go.cdx.json

```
#### Merging multiple CycloneDX SBOMs

You can use a CI/CD job to merge the multiple CycloneDX SBOMs into a single SBOM. GitLab uses
[CycloneDX Properties](https://cyclonedx.org/use-cases/#properties--name-value-store) to store
implementation-specific details in the metadata of each CycloneDX SBOM, such as the location of
build and lock files. If multiple CycloneDX SBOMs are merged together, this information is removed
from the resulting merged file.

For example, the following `.gitlab-ci.yml` extract demonstrates how the Cyclone SBOM files can be
merged, and the resulting file validated.
```
stages:
  - test
  - merge-cyclonedx-sboms

include:
  - template: Jobs/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

merge cyclonedx sboms:
  stage: merge-cyclonedx-sboms
  image:
    name: cyclonedx/cyclonedx-cli:0.25.1
    entrypoint: [""]
  script:
    - find . -name "gl-sbom-*.cdx.json" -exec cyclonedx merge --output-file gl-sbom-all.cdx.json --input-files "{}" +
    # optional: validate the merged sbom
    - cyclonedx validate --input-version v1_4 --input-file gl-sbom-all.cdx.json
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - gl-sbom-all.cdx.json

```
## Contributing to the vulnerability database

To find a vulnerability, you can search the [`GitLab Advisory Database`](https://advisories.gitlab.com/).
You can also [submit new vulnerabilities](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
## Offline environment

For GitLab Self-Managed instances in an environment with limited, restricted, or intermittent access
to external resources through the internet, some adjustments are required for dependency scanning
jobs to run successfully. For more information, see [Offline environments](../offline_deployments/index.html).
### Requirements

To run dependency scanning in an offline environment you must have:

* A GitLab Runner with the `docker` or `kubernetes` executor* Local copies of the dependency scanning analyzer images* Access to the [GitLab Advisory Database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db)

### Local copies of analyzer images

To use dependency scanning with all [supported languages and frameworks](#supported-languages-and-package-managers):

1. Import the following default dependency scanning analyzer images from `registry.gitlab.com` into
   your [local Docker container registry](../../packages/container_registry/index.html):
   ```
   registry.gitlab.com/security-products/gemnasium:5
   registry.gitlab.com/security-products/gemnasium:5-fips
   registry.gitlab.com/security-products/gemnasium-maven:5
   registry.gitlab.com/security-products/gemnasium-maven:5-fips
   registry.gitlab.com/security-products/gemnasium-python:5
   registry.gitlab.com/security-products/gemnasium-python:5-fips

   ```

   The process for importing Docker images into a local offline Docker registry depends on
   **your network security policy**. Consult your IT staff to find an accepted and approved
   process by which external resources can be imported or temporarily accessed.
   These scanners are [periodically updated](../index.html#vulnerability-scanner-maintenance)
   with new definitions, and you may want to download them regularly.- Configure GitLab CI/CD to use the local analyzers.

     Set the value of the CI/CD variable `SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX` to your local Docker registry - in
     this example, `docker-registry.example.com`.
     ```
     include:
       - template: Jobs/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

     variables:
       SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX: "docker-registry.example.com/analyzers"

     ```

### Access to the GitLab Advisory Database

The [GitLab Advisory Database](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db) is the
source of vulnerability data used by the `gemnasium`, `gemnasium-maven`, and `gemnasium-python`
analyzers. The Docker images of these analyzers include a clone of the database.
The clone is synchronized with the database before starting a scan,
to ensure the analyzers have the latest vulnerability data.

In an offline environment, the default host of the GitLab Advisory Database can‚Äôt be accessed.
Instead, you must host the database somewhere that it is accessible to the GitLab runners. You must
also update the database manually at your own schedule.

Available options for hosting the database are:

* [Use a clone of the GitLab Advisory Database](#use-a-copy-of-the-gitlab-advisory-database).* [Use a copy of the GitLab Advisory Database](#use-a-copy-of-the-gitlab-advisory-database).

#### Use a clone of the GitLab Advisory Database

Using a clone of the GitLab Advisory Database is recommended because it is the most efficient
method.

To host a clone of the GitLab Advisory Database:

1. Clone the GitLab Advisory Database to a host that is accessible by HTTP from the GitLab runners.- In your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, set the value of the CI/CD variable `GEMNASIUM_DB_REMOTE_URL` to
     the URL of the Git repository.

For example:
```
variables:
  GEMNASIUM_DB_REMOTE_URL: https://users-own-copy.example.com/gemnasium-db.git

```
#### Use a copy of the GitLab Advisory Database

Using a copy of the GitLab Advisory Database requires you to host an archive file which is
downloaded by the analyzers.

To use a copy of the GitLab Advisory Database:

1. Download an archive of the GitLab Advisory Database to a host that is accessible by HTTP from the
   GitLab runners. The archive is located at
   `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/gemnasium-db/-/archive/master/gemnasium-db-master.tar.gz`.- Update your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
     * Set CI/CD variable `GEMNASIUM_DB_LOCAL_PATH` to use the local copy of the database.* Set CI/CD variable `GEMNASIUM_DB_UPDATE_DISABLED` to disable the database update.* Download and extract the advisory database before the scan begins.
     ```
     variables:
       GEMNASIUM_DB_LOCAL_PATH: ./gemnasium-db-local
       GEMNASIUM_DB_UPDATE_DISABLED: "true"

     dependency_scanning:
       before_script:
         - wget https://local.example.com/gemnasium_db.tar.gz
         - mkdir -p $GEMNASIUM_DB_LOCAL_PATH
         - tar -xzvf gemnasium_db.tar.gz --strip-components=1 -C $GEMNASIUM_DB_LOCAL_PATH

     ```

## Using a proxy with Gradle projects

The Gradle wrapper script does not read the `HTTP(S)_PROXY` environment variables. See [this upstream issue](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/11065).

To make the Gradle wrapper script use a proxy, you can specify the options using the `GRADLE_CLI_OPTS` CI/CD variable:
```
variables:
  GRADLE_CLI_OPTS: "-Dhttps.proxyHost=squid-proxy -Dhttps.proxyPort=3128 -Dhttp.proxyHost=squid-proxy -Dhttp.proxyPort=3128 -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts=localhost"

```
## Using a proxy with Maven projects

Maven does not read the `HTTP(S)_PROXY` environment variables.

To make the Maven dependency scanner use a proxy, you can configure it using a `settings.xml` file (see [Maven documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html)) and instruct Maven to use this configuration by using the `MAVEN_CLI_OPTS` CI/CD variable:
```
variables:
  MAVEN_CLI_OPTS: "--settings mysettings.xml"

```
## Specific settings for languages and package managers

See the following sections for configuring specific languages and package managers.
### Python (pip)

If you need to install Python packages before the analyzer runs, you should use `pip install --user` in the `before_script` of the scanning job. The `--user` flag causes project dependencies to be installed in the user directory. If you do not pass the `--user` option, packages are installed globally, and they are not scanned and don‚Äôt show up when listing project dependencies.
### Python (setuptools)

If you need to install Python packages before the analyzer runs, you should use `python setup.py install --user` in the `before_script` of the scanning job. The `--user` flag causes project dependencies to be installed in the user directory. If you do not pass the `--user` option, packages are installed globally, and they are not scanned and don‚Äôt show up when listing project dependencies.

When using self-signed certificates for your private PyPi repository, no extra job configuration (aside
from the template `.gitlab-ci.yml` above) is needed. However, you must update your `setup.py` to
ensure that it can reach your private repository. Here is an example configuration:

1. Update `setup.py` to create a `dependency_links` attribute pointing at your private repository for each
   dependency in the `install_requires` list:
   ```
   install_requires=['pyparsing>=2.0.3'],
   dependency_links=['https://pypi.example.com/simple/pyparsing'],

   ```
    - Fetch the certificate from your repository URL and add it to the project:
     ```
     printf "\n" | openssl s_client -connect pypi.example.com:443 -servername pypi.example.com | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > internal.crt

     ```
      - Point `setup.py` at the newly downloaded certificate:
       ```
       import setuptools.ssl_support
       setuptools.ssl_support.cert_paths = ['internal.crt']

       ```

### Python (Pipenv)

If running in a limited network connectivity environment, you must configure the `PIPENV_PYPI_MIRROR`
variable to use a private PyPi mirror. This mirror must contain both default and development dependencies.
```
variables:
  PIPENV_PYPI_MIRROR: https://pypi.example.com/simple

```

Alternatively, if it‚Äôs not possible to use a private registry, you can load the required packages
into the Pipenv virtual environment cache. For this option, the project must check in the
`Pipfile.lock` into the repository, and load both default and development packages into the cache.
See the example [python-pipenv](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/tests/python-pipenv/-/blob/41cc017bd1ed302f6edebcfa3bc2922f428e07b6/.gitlab-ci.yml#L20-42)
project for an example of how this can be done.
## Warnings

We recommend that you use the most recent version of all containers, and the most recent supported version of all package managers and languages. Using previous versions carries an increased security risk because unsupported versions may no longer benefit from active security reporting and backporting of security fixes.
### Gradle projects

Do not override the `reports.html.destination` or `reports.html.outputLocation` properties when generating an HTML dependency report for Gradle projects. Doing so prevents Dependency Scanning from functioning correctly.
### Maven Projects

In isolated networks, if the central repository is a private registry (explicitly set with the `<mirror>` directive), Maven builds may fail to find the `gemnasium-maven-plugin` dependency. This issue occurs because Maven doesn‚Äôt search the local repository (`/root/.m2`) by default and attempts to fetch from the central repository. The result is an error about the missing dependency.
#### Workaround

To resolve this issue, add a `<pluginRepositories>` section to your `settings.xml` file. This allows Maven to find plugins in the local repository.

Before you begin, consider the following:

* This workaround is only for environments where the default Maven central repository is mirrored to a private registry.* After applying this workaround, Maven searches the local repository for plugins, which may have security implications in some environments. Make sure this aligns with your organization‚Äôs security policies.

Follow these steps to modify the `settings.xml` file:

1. Locate your Maven `settings.xml` file. This file is typically found in one of these locations:
   * `/root/.m2/settings.xml` for the root user.* `~/.m2/settings.xml` for a regular user.* `${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml` global settings.- Check if there‚Äôs an existing `<pluginRepositories>` section in the file.- If a `<pluginRepositories>` section already exists, add only the following `<pluginRepository>` element inside it.
       Otherwise, add the entire `<pluginRepositories>` section:
       ```
            <pluginRepositories>
              <pluginRepository>
                  <id>local2</id>
                  <name>local repository</name>
                  <url>file:///root/.m2/repository/</url>
              </pluginRepository>
            </pluginRepositories>

       ```
        - Run your Maven build or dependency scanning process again.

### Python projects

Extra care needs to be taken when using the [`PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/indexes.html)
environment variable due to a possible exploit documented by [CVE-2018-20225](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20225):
> An issue was discovered in pip (all versions) because it installs the version with the highest version number, even if the user had
> intended to obtain a private package from a private index. This only affects use of the `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` option, and exploitation
> requires that the package does not already exist in the public index (and thus the attacker can put the package there with an arbitrary
> version number).

### Version number parsing

In some cases it‚Äôs not possible to determine if the version of a project dependency is in the affected range of a security advisory.

For example:

* The version is unknown.* The version is invalid.* Parsing the version or comparing it to the range fails.* The version is a branch, like `dev-master` or `1.5.x`.* The compared versions are ambiguous. For example, `1.0.0-20241502` can‚Äôt be compared to `1.0.0-2`
          because one version contains a timestamp while the other does not.

In these cases, the analyzer skips the dependency and outputs a message to the log.

The GitLab analyzers do not make assumptions as they could result in a false positive or false
negative. For a discussion, see [issue 442027](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/442027).
## Build Swift projects

Swift Package Manager (SPM) is the official tool for managing the distribution of Swift code.
It‚Äôs integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Follow these best practices when you build a Swift project with SPM.

1. Include a `Package.resolved` file.

   The `Package.resolved` file locks your dependencies to specific versions.
   Always commit this file to your repository to ensure consistency across
   different environments.
   ```
   git add Package.resolved
   git commit -m "Add Package.resolved to lock dependencies"

   ```
    - To build your Swift project, use the following commands:
     ```
     # Update dependencies
     swift package update

     # Build the project
     swift build

     ```
      - To configure CI/CD, add these steps to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:
       ```
       swift-build:
         stage: build
         script:
           - swift package update
           - swift build

       ```
        - Optional. If you use private Swift package repositories with self-signed certificates,
         you might need to add the certificate to your project and configure Swift to trust it:
         1. Fetch the certificate:
            ```
            echo | openssl s_client -servername your.repo.url -connect your.repo.url:443 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END
            CERTIFICATE-/p' > repo-cert.crt

            ```
             - Add these lines to your Swift package manifest (`Package.swift`):
              ```
              import Foundation

              #if canImport(Security)
              import Security
              #endif

              extension Package {
                  public static func addCustomCertificate() {
                      guard let certPath = Bundle.module.path(forResource: "repo-cert", ofType: "crt") else {
                          fatalError("Certificate not found")
                      }
                      SecCertificateAddToSystemStore(SecCertificateCreateWithData(nil, try! Data(contentsOf: URL(fileURLWithPath: certPath)) as CFData)!)
                  }
              }

              // Call this before defining your package
              Package.addCustomCertificate()

              ```

Always test your build process in a clean environment to ensure your
dependencies are correctly specified and resolve automatically.
## Build CocoaPods projects

CocoaPods is a popular dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. It provides a standard format for managing external libraries in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS projects.

Follow these best practices when you build projects that use CocoaPods for dependency management.

1. Include a `Podfile.lock` file.

   The `Podfile.lock` file is crucial for locking your dependencies to specific versions. Always commit this file to your repository to ensure consistency across different environments.
   ```
   git add Podfile.lock
   git commit -m "Add Podfile.lock to lock CocoaPods dependencies"

   ```
    - You can build your project with one of the following:
     * The `xcodebuild` command-line tool:
       ```
       # Install CocoaPods dependencies
       pod install

       # Build the project
       xcodebuild -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme YourScheme build

       ```
        * The Xcode IDE:
         1. Open your `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.* Select your target scheme.* Select **Product > Build**. You can also press `‚åò`+`B`.* [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/), a tool for automating builds and releases for iOS and Android apps:
           1. Install `fastlane`:
              ```
              sudo gem install fastlane

              ```
               * In your project, configure `fastlane`:
                ```
                fastlane init

                ```
                 * Add a lane to your `fastfile`:
                  ```
                  lane :build do
                    cocoapods
                    gym(scheme: "YourScheme")
                  end

                  ```
                   * Run the build:
                    ```
                    fastlane build

                    ```* If your project uses both CocoaPods and Carthage, you can use Carthage to build your dependencies:
             1. Create a `Cartfile` that includes your CocoaPods dependencies.* Run the following:
                  ```
                  carthage update --platform iOS

                  ```- Configure CI/CD to build the project according to your preferred method.

       For example, using `xcodebuild`:
       ```
       cocoapods-build:
         stage: build
         script:
           - pod install
           - xcodebuild -workspace YourWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme YourScheme build

       ```
        - Optional. If you use private CocoaPods repositories,
         you might need to configure your project to access them:
         1. Add the private spec repo:
            ```
            pod repo add REPO_NAME SOURCE_URL

            ```
             - In your Podfile, specify the source:
              ```
              source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
              source 'SOURCE_URL'

              ```- Optional. If your private CocoaPods repository uses SSL, ensure the SSL certificate is properly configured:
           * If you use a self-signed certificate, add it to your system‚Äôs trusted certificates.
             You can also specify the SSL configuration in your `.netrc` file:
             ```
             machine your.private.repo.url
               login your_username
               password your_password
             ```- After you update your Podfile, run `pod install` to install dependencies and update your workspace.

Remember to always run `pod install` after updating your Podfile to ensure all dependencies are properly installed and the workspace is updated.

### @marcoris **[marcoris](/marcoris)** commented [Feb 9, 2024](#issue-2126673004)

For security reasons we have to "sanitize" the inputted string because of manipulating it.

Since the SANITIZE\_FILTER is removed at PHP >= v8 we can use htmlspecialchars

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Hi [@marcoris](https://github.com/marcoris)! Thanks for reaching out. I seems like a serious security issue. The exec command now uses quotes ('imagePath'), have you installed the latest version of this package? |

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That‚Äôs why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don‚Äôt and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world‚Äôs most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ‚Äúcopy/paste‚Äù?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot‚Äôs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not ‚Äúcopying and pasting‚Äù from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor‚Äîfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub‚Äôs model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub‚Äôs Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub‚Äôs retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features‚Äô effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot‚Äôs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here‚Äôs some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:¬† Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot‚Äôs AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub‚Äôs public repositories‚Äîwhich are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub‚Äôs research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub‚Äôs AI model. Again, Copilot does not ‚Äúlook up‚Äù or ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù code, but is instead using context from a user‚Äôs workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot‚Äôs model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there‚Äôs a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories‚Äîincluding ones without licenses‚Äîthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don‚Äôt determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we‚Äôve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It‚Äôs not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called ‚ÄúCopilot‚Äù not ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù and it‚Äôs not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses ‚Äì rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. ‚Äì you should continue these policies with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot‚Äôs suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You‚Äôre entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot‚Äôs filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That‚Äôs why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don‚Äôt and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world‚Äôs most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ‚Äúcopy/paste‚Äù?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot‚Äôs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not ‚Äúcopying and pasting‚Äù from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor‚Äîfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot‚Äôs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here‚Äôs some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:¬† Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models.

GitHub Copilot‚Äôs AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub‚Äôs public repositories‚Äîwhich are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub‚Äôs research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub‚Äôs AI model. Again, Copilot does not ‚Äúlook up‚Äù or ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù code, but is instead using context from a user‚Äôs workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot‚Äôs model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there‚Äôs a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories‚Äîincluding ones without licenses‚Äîthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don‚Äôt determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we‚Äôve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It‚Äôs not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called ‚ÄúCopilot‚Äù not ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù and it‚Äôs not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses ‚Äì rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. ‚Äì you should continue these policies with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot‚Äôs suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You‚Äôre entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot‚Äôs filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

# CVE-2024-48514: php-heic-to-jpg is vulnerable to Code Injection

## Information

**Description:** This allows code injection by a user who can upload heic images, which affects the php-heic-to-jpg converter.

**Versions Affected:** <= 1.0.5

**Version Fixed:** [PullRequest #34](https://github.com/MaestroError/php-heic-to-jpg/pull/34) (1.0.6)

**Researcher:** Marco Ris (<https://github.com/marcoris>)

**Disclosure Link:** [MaestroError/php-heic-to-jpg#32](https://github.com/MaestroError/php-heic-to-jpg/issues/32)

**NIST CVE Link:** <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-48514>

## Proof-of-Concept Exploit

### Description

php-heic-to-jpg <= 1.0.5 is vulnerable to code injection. An attacker who can upload heic images is able to inject code on the remote server via the file name. As a result, the CIA is no longer guaranteed. This affects php-heic-to-jpg 1.0.5 and below.

### Usage/Exploitation

Upload a HEIC image file and intercept the request, e.g. with Burp Suite. Rename the file name to `‚Äù;whoami;#` and forward the request. The response shows the following error message with the disclosed `whoami` information:

```
The file &quot;;whoami;# has been uploaded.<br>
RuntimeException: Couldn't convert HEIC to JPG: 'Not enough arguments, needs: [command] [file1.heic] [file2.jpg]\nCreated by MaestroError\nwww-data' | Bin used: 'heicToJpg' HEIC: 'uploads/";whoami;#' Full Command: '/var/www/html/src/../bin/heicToJpg "uploads/";whoami;#" "uploads/";whoami;#-16541469646585ff874c9302.07761671" 2>&1' Output from heif-converter-image exe:  in /var/www/html/src/HeicToJpg.php:204

# php-heic-to-jpg

The easiest way to convert HEIC/HEIF images to JPEG with PHP and Laravel framework. It uses binary file created with Go language and has no dependencies on any other PHP libraries, extensions or third-part software

* [Installation](#installation)

  + [For MacOS users](#for-macos-users)
  + [Force arm64 for linux](#force-arm64-for-linux)

  + [Mdat issue](##handling-mdat-file-conversion-issues)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [Support](#support)

## Installation

*Run command in your project's root directory*

```
composer require maestroerror/php-heic-to-jpg

```

## Usage

Using the class "HeicToJpeg" is extremely simple. You need full location of any HEIC image to pass in "convert" function and call "saveAs" (save as file) or "get" (get file contents) methods.

```
// 1. save as file
Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convert("image1.heic")->saveAs("image1.jpg");
// 2. get content (binary) of converted JPG
$jpg = Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convert("image1.heic")->get();
```

#### For MacOS users

It should detect the OS itself, but if you want to specify architecture, it is recommended to use `convertOnMac` instead. The second argument is architecture of your system, by default set as "amd64", but you can specify "arm64" (AArch64, M1)

*Note: As reported by several users, M1 Macbook works on `amd64` binary file, so if `arm64` doesn't work for you, just try `convertOnMac("image1.heic")`*

```
// By default
Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convertOnMac("image1.heic", "arm64")->saveAs("image1.jpg");
```

#### Force arm64 for linux

In case of linux, for some reason, if it doesn't detect your architecture correct or just the `php-heic-to-jpg-linux-arm64` binary is working for you well, (From v1.0.4) you can force it to use in `convert` and `convertFromUrl` by passing true as third argument:

```
Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convert("image1.heic", "", true)->saveAs("image.jpg");
```

#### isHeic method

Before converting, you can use the isHeic method (contributed by [pbs-dg](https://github.com/pbs-dg)) to check if a file is HEIC format.

```
$fileIsHeic = HeicToJpg::isHeic("image.heic");
if ($fileIsHeic) {
    // Your code
}
```

#### convertFromUrl method

If your image is available publicly, you can easily convert and save it in your file system using `convertFromUrl` method:

```
Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convertFromUrl("https://github.com/MaestroError/php-heic-to-jpg/raw/maestro/tests/Unit/images/image1.heic")->saveAs("image1.jpg");
```

#### Handling 'mdat' File Conversion Issues

If you encounter an issue where the module cannot convert certain images produced by Samsung devices (detailed in this [issue](https://github.com/MaestroError/php-heic-to-jpg/issues/15)), resulting in the error `error reading "meta" box: got box type "mdat" instead`, you can take the following steps:

[heif-converter-image](https://github.com/MaestroError/heif-converter-image) is already required by composer in this (php-heic-to-jpg) package. `heif-converter-image` depends on [libheif](https://github.com/strukturag/libheif) and provides installation scripts for various platforms refer to it's [documentation](https://github.com/MaestroError/heif-converter-image).

* Ensure you have `maestroerror/heif-converter` required in composer by running `composer require maestroerror/heif-converter`.
* Make sure libheif is installed on your system. You can check the [libheif](https://github.com/strukturag/libheif) for installation instructions or use installation script for your platform provided by [heif-converter-image](https://github.com/MaestroError/heif-converter-image).

The `php-heic-to-jpg` package automatically detects the presence of the `heif-converter-image` package and will attempt to use its Command Line Interface (CLI) executable for conversion if default conversion fails.

In case the package cannot find the `heif-converter-image` CLI, you can specify the path as an argument in the `convert` and `convertOnMac` methods like so:

```
HeicToJpg::convert("image.heic", "path/to/your/bin/heif-converter-{linux/windows/macos}")->saveAs("image.jpg");
HeicToJpg::convertOnMac("image.heic", "arm64", "path/to/your/bin/heif-converter-macos")->saveAs("image.jpg");
HeicToJpg::convertFromUrl("SOME_URL", "path/to/your/bin/heif-converter-{linux/windows/macos}")->saveAs("image.jpg");
```

With these steps, you should be able to handle the conversion of images that were previously causing issues.

## Credits

I would like to say thanks to these people. Their work helped me to build heicToJpg file with Go:

* heif parser by @bradfitz (<https://github.com/go4org/go4/tree/master/media/heif>)
* libde265 (<https://github.com/strukturag/libde265>)
* implementation learnt from libheif (<https://github.com/strukturag/libheif>)
* Edd Turtle (<https://gophercoding.com/convert-heic-to-jpeg-go/>)
* crazy-max/xgo (<https://github.com/crazy-max/xgo>)

# CVE-2024-48514: Remote code execution in php-heic-to-jpg

October 24, 2024
(updated
December 19, 2024)

php-heic-to-jpg < 1.0.5 is vulnerable to remote code execution. An attacker who can upload heic images is able to execute code on the remote server via the file name. As a result, the CIA is no longer guaranteed. This affects php-heic-to-jpg below 1.0.5.

# php-heic-to-jpg

The easiest way to convert HEIC/HEIF images to JPEG with PHP and Laravel framework. It uses binary file created with Go language and has no dependencies on any other PHP libraries, extensions or third-part software

* [Credits](#credits)
* [Support](#support)

## Installation

*Run command in your project's root directory*

```
composer require maestroerror/php-heic-to-jpg

```

## Usage

Using the class "HeicToJpeg" is extremely simple. You need full location of any HEIC image to pass in "convert" function and call "saveAs" (save as file) or "get" (get file contents) methods.

```
// 1. save as file
Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convert("image1.heic")->saveAs("image1.jpg");
// 2. get content (binary) of converted JPG
$jpg = Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convert("image1.heic")->get();
```

#### For MacOS users

It should detect the OS itself, but if you want to specify architecture, it is recommended to use `convertOnMac` instead. The second argument is architecture of your system, by default set as "amd64", but you can specify "arm64" (AArch64, M1)

*Note: As reported by several users, M1 Macbook works on `amd64` binary file, so if `arm64` doesn't work for you, just try `convertOnMac("image1.heic")`*

```
// By default
Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convertOnMac("image1.heic", "arm64")->saveAs("image1.jpg");
```

#### Force arm64 for linux

In case of linux, for some reason, if it doesn't detect your architecture correct or just the `php-heic-to-jpg-linux-arm64` binary is working for you well, (From v1.0.4) you can force it to use in `convert` and `convertFromUrl` by passing true as third argument:

```
Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convert("image1.heic", "", true)->saveAs("image.jpg");
```

#### isHeic method

Before converting, you can use the isHeic method (contributed by [pbs-dg](https://github.com/pbs-dg)) to check if a file is HEIC format.

```
$fileIsHeic = HeicToJpg::isHeic("image.heic");
if ($fileIsHeic) {
    // Your code
}
```

#### convertFromUrl method

If your image is available publicly, you can easily convert and save it in your file system using `convertFromUrl` method:

```
Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convertFromUrl("https://github.com/MaestroError/php-heic-to-jpg/raw/maestro/tests/Unit/images/image1.heic")->saveAs("image1.jpg");
```

#### Handling 'mdat' File Conversion Issues

If you encounter an issue where the module cannot convert certain images produced by Samsung devices (detailed in this [issue](https://github.com/MaestroError/php-heic-to-jpg/issues/15)), resulting in the error `error reading "meta" box: got box type "mdat" instead`, you can take the following steps:

[heif-converter-image](https://github.com/MaestroError/heif-converter-image) is already required by composer in this (php-heic-to-jpg) package. `heif-converter-image` depends on [libheif](https://github.com/strukturag/libheif) and provides installation scripts for various platforms refer to it's [documentation](https://github.com/MaestroError/heif-converter-image).

* Ensure you have `maestroerror/heif-converter` required in composer by running `composer require maestroerror/heif-converter`.
* Make sure libheif is installed on your system. You can check the [libheif](https://github.com/strukturag/libheif) for installation instructions or use installation script for your platform provided by [heif-converter-image](https://github.com/MaestroError/heif-converter-image).

The `php-heic-to-jpg` package automatically detects the presence of the `heif-converter-image` package and will attempt to use its Command Line Interface (CLI) executable for conversion if default conversion fails.

In case the package cannot find the `heif-converter-image` CLI, you can specify the path as an argument in the `convert` and `convertOnMac` methods like so:

```
HeicToJpg::convert("image.heic", "path/to/your/bin/heif-converter-{linux/windows/macos}")->saveAs("image.jpg");
HeicToJpg::convertOnMac("image.heic", "arm64", "path/to/your/bin/heif-converter-macos")->saveAs("image.jpg");
HeicToJpg::convertFromUrl("SOME_URL", "path/to/your/bin/heif-converter-{linux/windows/macos}")->saveAs("image.jpg");
```

With these steps, you should be able to handle the conversion of images that were previously causing issues.

## Credits

I would like to say thanks to these people. Their work helped me to build heicToJpg file with Go:

* heif parser by @bradfitz (<https://github.com/go4org/go4/tree/master/media/heif>)
* libde265 (<https://github.com/strukturag/libde265>)
* implementation learnt from libheif (<https://github.com/strukturag/libheif>)

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A ‚ÄúPersonal Account‚Äù represents an individual User‚Äôs authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User‚Äôs identity on GitHub. ‚ÄúOrganizations‚Äù are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the ‚ÄúTerms of Service‚Äù or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. ‚ÄúContent‚Äù refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. ‚ÄúUser-Generated Content‚Äù is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. ‚ÄúGitHub,‚Äù ‚ÄúWe,‚Äù and ‚ÄúUs‚Äù refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The ‚ÄúService‚Äù refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. ‚ÄúThe User,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou,‚Äù and ‚ÄúYour‚Äù refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The ‚ÄúWebsite‚Äù refers to GitHub‚Äôs website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub‚Äôs conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization‚Äôs data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User‚Äôs Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country‚Äôs minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country‚Äôs laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person ‚Äî i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us ‚Äî and other GitHub Users ‚Äî certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 ‚Äî D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 ‚Äî D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement‚Äîfor security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright ¬© GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved.

If you‚Äôd like to use GitHub‚Äôs trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn‚Äôt available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it‚Äôs important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub‚Äôs confidential information (collectively, ‚ÄúConfidential Information‚Äù), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the ‚ÄúPurpose‚Äù), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don‚Äôt otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We‚Äôre always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, ‚ÄúFeedback‚Äù), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form.

Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

# About GitLab

Behind the scenes of The DevSecOps Platform

       ![](//images.ctfassets.net/xz1dnu24egyd/6CobGNlzq4cGNWFV7ysKHu/92114531c0e8a8706d9c9f0f5c9c3535/387A1158__4_.jpg)
## What we do

**We're the company behind GitLab, the most comprehensive DevSecOps platform.**

What started in 2011 as an open source project to help one team of programmers collaborate is now the platform millions of people use to deliver software faster, more efficiently, while strengthening security and compliance.

Since the beginning, we've been firm believers in remote work, open source, DevSecOps, and iteration. We get up and log on in the morning (or whenever we choose to start our days) to work alongside the GitLab community to deliver new innovations every month that help teams focus on shipping great code faster, not their toolchain.

# php-heic-to-jpg

The easiest way to convert HEIC/HEIF images to JPEG with PHP and Laravel framework. It uses binary file created with Go language and has no dependencies on any other PHP libraries, extensions or third-part software

## Installation

*Run command in your project's root directory*

```
composer require maestroerror/php-heic-to-jpg

```

## Usage

Using the class "HeicToJpeg" is extremely simple. You need full location of any HEIC image to pass in "convert" function and call "saveAs" (save as file) or "get" (get file contents) methods.

```
// 1. save as file
Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convert("image1.heic")->saveAs("image1.jpg");
// 2. get content (binary) of converted JPG
$jpg = Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convert("image1.heic")->get();
```

#### For MacOS users

It should detect the OS itself, but if you want to specify architecture, it is recommended to use `convertOnMac` instead. The second argument is architecture of your system, by default set as "amd64", but you can specify "arm64" (AArch64, M1)

*Note: As reported by several users, M1 Macbook works on `amd64` binary file, so if `arm64` doesn't work for you, just try `convertOnMac("image1.heic")`*

```
// By default
Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convertOnMac("image1.heic", "arm64")->saveAs("image1.jpg");
```

#### Force arm64 for linux

In case of linux, for some reason, if it doesn't detect your architecture correct or just the `php-heic-to-jpg-linux-arm64` binary is working for you well, (From v1.0.4) you can force it to use in `convert` and `convertFromUrl` by passing true as third argument:

```
Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convert("image1.heic", "", true)->saveAs("image.jpg");
```

#### isHeic method

Before converting, you can use the isHeic method (contributed by [pbs-dg](https://github.com/pbs-dg)) to check if a file is HEIC format.

```
$fileIsHeic = HeicToJpg::isHeic("image.heic");
if ($fileIsHeic) {
    // Your code
}
```

#### convertFromUrl method

If your image is available publicly, you can easily convert and save it in your file system using `convertFromUrl` method:

```
Maestroerror\HeicToJpg::convertFromUrl("https://github.com/MaestroError/php-heic-to-jpg/raw/maestro/tests/Unit/images/image1.heic")->saveAs("image1.jpg");
```

#### Handling 'mdat' File Conversion Issues

If you encounter an issue where the module cannot convert certain images produced by Samsung devices (detailed in this [issue](https://github.com/MaestroError/php-heic-to-jpg/issues/15)), resulting in the error `error reading "meta" box: got box type "mdat" instead`, you can take the following steps:

[heif-converter-image](https://github.com/MaestroError/heif-converter-image) is already required by composer in this (php-heic-to-jpg) package. `heif-converter-image` depends on [libheif](https://github.com/strukturag/libheif) and provides installation scripts for various platforms refer to it's [documentation](https://github.com/MaestroError/heif-converter-image).

* Ensure you have `maestroerror/heif-converter` required in composer by running `composer require maestroerror/heif-converter`.
* Make sure libheif is installed on your system. You can check the [libheif](https://github.com/strukturag/libheif) for installation instructions or use installation script for your platform provided by [heif-converter-image](https://github.com/MaestroError/heif-converter-image).

The `php-heic-to-jpg` package automatically detects the presence of the `heif-converter-image` package and will attempt to use its Command Line Interface (CLI) executable for conversion if default conversion fails.

In case the package cannot find the `heif-converter-image` CLI, you can specify the path as an argument in the `convert` and `convertOnMac` methods like so:

```
HeicToJpg::convert("image.heic", "path/to/your/bin/heif-converter-{linux/windows/macos}")->saveAs("image.jpg");
HeicToJpg::convertOnMac("image.heic", "arm64", "path/to/your/bin/heif-converter-macos")->saveAs("image.jpg");
HeicToJpg::convertFromUrl("SOME_URL", "path/to/your/bin/heif-converter-{linux/windows/macos}")->saveAs("image.jpg");
```

With these steps, you should be able to handle the conversion of images that were previously causing issues.
