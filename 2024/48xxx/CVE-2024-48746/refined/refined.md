The provided content is related to CVE-2024-48746 and provides a detailed description of the vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input validation and client-side control mechanisms within the Lens Visual Power BI integration's natural language processing component. This allows for prompt injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prompt Injection (LLM01):**  The system is vulnerable to prompt injection attacks due to lack of proper input sanitization. Attackers can manipulate the language model's behavior by injecting malicious instructions.
- **Client-Side Control:**  The configuration and restrictions for the chat system are implemented client-side, allowing attackers to modify these settings, which contributes to the prompt injection vulnerability.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** Absence of adequate input validation and sanitization allows for malicious code injection via user input fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the system by injecting and executing Python code (or other commands).
- **Information Disclosure:**  Exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Compromised Data Integrity and Confidentiality:** Attackers can manipulate data interactions, execute unauthorized commands, and potentially extract sensitive server information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Text Input:**  An attacker injects malicious instructions into text input fields.
- **Prompt Manipulation:** An attacker directly manipulates prompts to bypass intended functionality and execute unintended actions.
- **Base64 Encoded Payload:** The attacker uses Base64 encoding to inject a Python command which then gets executed by the server-side component.
- **Modified Chat Configuration:** Attackers can modify client-side chat configurations to weaken restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely via the application's API interface.
- **Ability to send crafted prompts:** The attacker must be able to send crafted prompts that include malicious code or instructions to the system.
