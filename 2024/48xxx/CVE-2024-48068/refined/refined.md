**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-48068

**Vendor of Product:** Shenzhen Landray Software Co., LTD.

**Product:** Landray EKP

**Version:** <=v16

**Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Description:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Landray EKP version v16 and earlier. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML by injecting a crafted payload.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser session. This could lead to various malicious activities like:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Information theft (if the user has access to sensitive data within the application)
    - Other unauthorized actions.

**Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector is through a crafted payload injected into a vulnerable part of the Landray EKP application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to find an entry point where the application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input. They would then inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code. This typically requires the ability to provide input to the application, either directly through forms or indirectly through other means. The attacker may need to be an authenticated user with access to the specific feature/module or may find an unauthenticated entry point.
