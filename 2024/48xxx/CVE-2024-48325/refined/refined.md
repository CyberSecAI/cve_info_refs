Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `getDocuments` function of the `InstituicaoDocumentacaoController` class.
- The `instituicao_id` parameter from the HTTP request is directly embedded into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization of the `instituicao_id` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
- Attackers could manipulate data within the database by injecting malicious SQL commands.
- Attackers can perform database enumeration and potentially extract sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the `/module/Api/InstituicaoDocumentacao` endpoint with a malicious `instituicao_id` parameter.
- Example endpoint: `/module/Api/InstituicaoDocumentacao?oper=get&resource=getDocuments&instituicao_id=14`
- Example exploit: `/module/Api/InstituicaoDocumentacao?oper=get&resource=getDocuments&instituicao_id=14+AND+(CAST(VERSION()+AS+INTEGER))%3d1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional details from the content:**

- The vulnerability was discovered in Portabilis i-Educar 2.8.0.
- The provided exploit attempts to cast the database version to an integer and compare it to 1, this will cause an error but demonstrates the vulnerability.
- The content also demonstrates how to use `sqlmap` to automatically exploit the vulnerability and enumerate database information.
- The recommended solution is to use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection by sanitizing the `instituicao_id` parameter.
