The provided content is related to CVE-2024-48984.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `hciEvtProcessLeExtAdvReport` function in the Cordio BLE stack.
- The function parses lists of HCI reports by dynamically reading a byte from the input buffer to determine the list's length.
- It then iterates through the list, reads the length of each individual report, and allocates a buffer to hold the largest report.
- However, there is no check to ensure that all report lengths are actually within the bounds of the input buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability: The function reads report lengths without proper bounds checking. If a crafted HCI event is received, the function can read beyond the allocated buffer.
- Insufficient input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to a denial-of-service or other undefined behaviors.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker sends a crafted BLE HCI event to the affected device, containing a list of report lengths where the report lengths extend beyond the bounds of the input buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted BLE HCI events to the vulnerable device. This implies a position within the BLE range of the device.
