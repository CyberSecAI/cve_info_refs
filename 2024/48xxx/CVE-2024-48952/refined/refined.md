{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Logpoint SOAR component uses a static JWT secret key for generating tokens, which allows access to SOAR API endpoints without authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a static cryptographic key for JWT token generation",
      "Lack of proper authentication for SOAR API endpoints"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can create custom JWT secret keys for unauthorized access to SOAR API endpoints.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by generating a valid JWT using the static key, and then using it to access the SOAR APIs.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to know or obtain the static JWT secret key, which can be obtained through various means, including reverse engineering the software or leaked credentials. It is unclear if the attacker needs to be on the same network."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Logpoint versions prior to 7.5.0"
  ],
  "solution": "Upgrade to Logpoint v7.5.0."
