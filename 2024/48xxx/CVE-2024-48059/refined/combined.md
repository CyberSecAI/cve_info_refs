|  | ### Description |
|  |  |
|  | The `gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt` project, version <= 20240802, contains a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WebSocket session transmission. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript into a WebSocket message, which is then stored within the session data. When a victim accesses this session, the malicious script is executed in the victim’s browser, potentially allowing the attacker to hijack sessions, steal sensitive information, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim. |
