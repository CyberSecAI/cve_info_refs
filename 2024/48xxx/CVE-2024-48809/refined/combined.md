|  | SDRAN ONOS A1T - Policy Concurrency Issue |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | Overview |
|  | This repository demonstrates a Proof of Concept (PoC) Denial of Service (DoS) attack targeting the ONOS A1 Termination (a1t) module |
|  | within the SDRAN-in-a-box deployment. The attack exploits a policy concurrency vulnerability by replaying multiple concurrent |
|  | A1 policies, resulting in service termination and impacting the management of A1 policies within the SD-RAN ORAN deployment. |
|  |  |
|  | Attack Description |
|  | The ONOS A1 Termination component in SD-RAN ORAN is vulnerable to a DoS attack through the continuous replay of concurrent |
|  | HTTP-based policies. By exploiting this issue, attackers can disrupt the service, causing it to crash and rendering it unable to |
|  | manage A1 policies effectively. |

|  | > Issue: Our tests revealed that the ONOS A1 Termination component of SD RAN ORAN deployment was susceptible to a Denial of Service attack through the continuous replay of concurrent HTTP policies. This attack resulted in the termination of the service, impacting the management of A1 policies. |
|  | > |
|  | > Logs Overview: The strace logs show a panic was triggered during a sequence of epoll\_pwait and futex operations, which can hint about thread synchronization issues. Multiple write system calls were noted, corresponding to log outputs of watcher deletions. This aligns with the A1 Termination service logs, which indicate a panic when attempting to close a nil channel in the DeleteWatcher method. |
|  | > |
|  | > Attack Reproduction : We tested the SDRAN-in-a-Box (RiaB) v1.4.3, specifically the RAN Simulator and Rimedo Traffic Steering xApp edition ( https://docs.sd-ran.org/master/sdran-in-a-box/docs/Installation\_RANSim\_RIMDEO\_TS.html ). However, we believe this attack is applicable to all other editions that utilize the AI Termination module. The attack consists of replaying the JSON-based Traffic Steering Policies (ORAN\_TrafficSteeringPreference\_2.0.0) by scripting a multithreaded curl command. |
|  | > |
|  | > Technical Details: |
|  | > |
|  | > Strace Logs: |
|  | > |
|  | > Several calls to futex indicate thread synchronization efforts, with one returning -1 EAGAIN (resource temporarily unavailable), suggesting a possible race condition. |
|  | > A1 Termination Logs: |
|  | > |
|  | > The error originated in the DeleteWatcher function (stream/broker.go:129-132) with a panic message: "close of nil channel" at broker.go:130. onos-a1t/pkg/stream/broker.go at master onosproject/onos-a1t GitHub |
|  | > |
|  | > The goroutine in question (goroutine 2793) was active during the panic, attempting to delete a watcher from a map with UUIDs tied to components like EnrichmentInformation and PolicyManagement. |

| **Issue Summary –**  Issue: Our tests revealed that the ONOS A1 Termination component of SD RAN ORAN deployment was susceptible to a Denial of Service attack through the continuous replay of concurrent HTTP policies. This attack resulted in the termination of the service, impacting the management of A1 policies.  Logs Overview: The strace logs show a panic was triggered during a sequence of epoll\_pwait and futex operations, which can hint about thread synchronization issues. Multiple write system calls were noted, corresponding to log outputs of watcher deletions. This aligns with the A1 Termination service logs, which indicate a panic when attempting to close a nil channel in the DeleteWatcher method.  Attack Reproduction : We tested the SDRAN-in-a-Box (RiaB) v1.4.3, specifically the RAN Simulator and Rimedo Traffic Steering xApp edition ( <https://docs.sd-ran.org/master/sdran-in-a-box/docs/Installation_RANSim_RIMDEO_TS.html> ). However, we believe this attack is applicable to all other editions that utilize the AI Termination module. The attack consists of replaying the JSON-based Traffic Steering Policies (ORAN\_TrafficSteeringPreference\_2.0.0) by scripting a multithreaded curl command.  **Technical Details:**  **Strace Logs:**   * Several calls to futex indicate thread synchronization efforts, with one returning -1 EAGAIN (resource temporarily unavailable), suggesting a possible race condition.   **A1 Termination Logs:**   * The error originated in the DeleteWatcher function (stream/broker.go:129-132) with a panic message: "close of nil channel" at broker.go:130.
