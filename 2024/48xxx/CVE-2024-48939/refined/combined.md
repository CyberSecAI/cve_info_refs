CloudAware Security Advisory

CVE-2024-48939: Unauthorized enabling of API in Paxton Net2 software

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

```
Bypass of Paxton Net2 API license. Possible leaking of PII and access to
admin functionality.
```

No physical access to computer running Paxton Net2 is required.

========================================================================
Product
========================================================================
* Paxton Net2  (version < 6.07.14023.5015 (SR4))

========================================================================
Detailed description
========================================================================

```
Paxton Net2 software offers an API. This API offers the user access to
sensitive data such as access logs and other
```

user data.[2]

```
In order to enable the API a license file is needed. The license file is
trivial to generate as demonstrated in POC in ref [1].
This is possible while the signature checks in the Net2 software were
not functional for the license file.
Additionally to the license file user credentials are needed to
authenticate against the API.
The vendor has fixed this in version 6.07.14023.5015 (SR4) of the Net2
software.
```

========================================================================
Solution
========================================================================
Upgrade Paxton Net2 to version 6.07.14023.5015 (SR4)

========================================================================
Mitigation
========================================================================

```
1) If an upgrade is not an option - as `anyone' can create valid license
files; ensure that the filesystem of
```

computers running Paxton Net2 are not reachable by unauthorised entities.

```
2) Evaluate the impact of the disclosure of any configurations rolled
out prior to these mitigation steps

## Our solutions

       [![Image](data:image/svg+xml;base64...)
## Access control

Access control offers a secure, convenient and flexible way of controlling who has access to your building and when that access is allowed.

Unlike locks and keys, access control can offer you more functionality integrating with other systems like CCTV, fire and intruder alarms for a complete solution.](https://www.paxton-access.com/solutions/access-control/)     [![Image](data:image/svg+xml;base64...)
## Wireless door handles

Our range of wireless door handles are designed with security built-in and can be installed by themselves or as part of a wider solution to offer you more flexibility.

The electronic handles communicate wirelessly, reducing cabling and making them straightforward to fit an existing door saving installation time.](https://www.paxton-access.com/solutions/electronic-door-handles/)     [![Image](data:image/svg+xml;base64...)
## Door entry

Door entry allows the user to validate a visitor at their entry panel before they grant them access via their internal monitor. Our door entry system comprises three simple components; external panel, door control unit and internal monitor.

Door entry systems can provide a great addition to an existing access control system or be used standalone.](https://www.paxton-access.com/solutions/door-entry/)     [![Image](data:image/svg+xml;base64...)
## Video surveillance

Video surveillance provides increased site security with a visual overview of what is happening at your premises.

A camera system can offer an increased sense of security and reassurance that your premises are protected. In the case of an attempted breach, video footage will provide you with evidence and possible identification.](https://www.paxton-access.com/solutions/video-surveillance)
