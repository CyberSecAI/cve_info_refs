- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A Link Layer length overflow in the BLE SDK due to a buffer overflow. The vulnerability is triggered when the length field of the LL Pause Enc Req data header is manipulated to be larger than its actual value.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The device firmware crashes when processing the mutated packet and disconnects. A device reset is required to restore normal operation.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the length field of the LL Pause Enc Req data header in a BLE packet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted BLE packets to the vulnerable device.
