|  | ### CVE-2024-48052: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Gradio <= 4.42.0 |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | ### Description |
|  |  |
|  | In Gradio version <= 4.42.0, a hidden SSRF vulnerability exists within the `gr.DownloadButton` function. This vulnerability stems from the `save\_url\_to\_cache` function, which lacks URL restrictions, enabling access to local resources. Exploitation can lead to unauthorized download of local resources or exposure of sensitive information. Attackers leveraging this flaw may execute SSRF attacks by tricking the application into making requests to internal services, potentially leading to severe data exposure or application compromise. |
|  |  |
|  | ### Vulnerability Type |
|  |  |
|  | - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) |
|  |  |
|  | ### Vendor of Product |
|  |  |
|  | - https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio |
|  |  |
|  | ### Affected Product Code Base |
|  |  |
|  | - Gradio <= 4.42.0 |
|  |  |
|  | ### Affected Component |
|  |  |
|  | - The `gr.DownloadButton` function, specifically within the `save\_url\_to\_cache` method, where unrestricted URL access facilitates SSRF. |
|  |  |
|  | ### Attack Type |
|  |  |
|  | - Local |
|  |  |
|  | ### Impact |
|  |  |
|  | - Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Resources |
|  |  |
|  | ### Attack Vectors |
|  |  |
|  | - The SSRF vulnerability can be triggered by invoking the `gr.DownloadButton` with an arbitrary URL due to the lack of validation in `save\_url\_to\_cache`. In severe cases, this allows the download of local resources or sensitive data. |
