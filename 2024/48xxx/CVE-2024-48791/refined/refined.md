Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the report:

**Vulnerability:** Incorrect Access Control leading to firmware leakage

**Root Cause:** The vendor's firmware server lacks proper access controls, allowing unauthorized access to firmware files. The application uses HTTP requests to download firmware updates. By reverse engineering the app, it was possible to identify the firmware download mechanism and the download link. Dynamic testing revealed that the vendor's firmware server lacks proper access control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper access controls on the firmware server. This means there's no authentication or authorization required to download firmware files.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** The app uses direct URLs to access firmware files, which is a form of direct object reference vulnerability.
*   **Plain HTTP:** The use of plain HTTP for firmware download is also a vulnerability as it can expose communication to network eavesdropping and tampering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Firmware Leakage:** Attackers can download the latest firmware before it's officially released, gaining access to sensitive information and potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Firmware Analysis:** Downloaded firmware can be analyzed for vulnerabilities, proprietary information, or to create modified firmware images.
*   **Malicious Firmware Injection:** Attackers can create modified firmware with malicious code and distribute it to unsuspecting users, potentially compromising their devices.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:** This could lead to supply chain attacks by injecting malware into firmware updates.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** Attackers can gain access to the firmware by sending direct HTTP requests to the server.
*   **Reverse Engineering:** The attacker needs to reverse engineer the mobile application to discover the firmware download URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Reverse Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to reverse engineer the mobile app to extract the URL's
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to send HTTP requests to the vendor's server.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** Understanding of how to make HTTP requests to a server.

**Additional Information:**
*   The report notes that 46 firmware images were downloaded, indicating the scale of the potential leakage.
*   The provided `GET` requests, responses, and URLs in the report show how an attacker could download the firmware files.
* The vendor is Plug n Play Camera and the product is `com.starvedia.mCamView.zwave`.
* The vulnerable version is 5.5.1
* The report mentions that the server is running Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS) PHP/5.4.16
