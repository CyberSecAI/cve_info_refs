The provided content is related to CVE-2024-48814.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `SilverpeasBeanDAO` interface allows direct SQL `where` clauses to be passed to filter data.
- The application does not sanitize or validate this input, leading to SQL injection.
- Some where clauses originate directly from the web layer, allowing users to manipulate them before sending them to Silverpeas.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** Unsanitized user input is directly incorporated into SQL queries.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize and validate user-provided `where` clauses.
- **Insecure Data Access:** The `findByWhereClause` function directly integrates user input into SQL statements.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can access sensitive data, including user credentials, by manipulating SQL queries.
- **Database Compromise:** Attackers can potentially compromise the databaseâ€™s integrity by executing arbitrary SQL commands.
- **Operational Disruption:** Malicious SQL commands can disrupt normal database operations.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data can be exfiltrated by crafting union-based SQL injection payloads.

**Attack vectors:**
- The `ViewType` parameter in the Taxonomy module is the entry point for the SQL injection.
- Attackers inject malicious SQL payloads into the `where` clause via the `ViewType` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the web interface of the application.
- An attacker with a `SilverAdmin` account is able to exploit this vulnerability
- No other special privileges are mentioned in the provided text.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed by replacing direct `where` clauses with a `BeanCriterion` object. This object forces the business layer to decode expectations into a `BeanCriterion` before passing to `SilverpeasBeanDAO`.
- The `BeanCriterion` uses `PreparedStatement` to prevent injection attacks. The parameters are set by using the corresponding interface of the `PreparedStatement`, which encodes the textual values.
