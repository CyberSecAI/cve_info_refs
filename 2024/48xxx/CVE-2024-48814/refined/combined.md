### @mmoqui **[mmoqui](/mmoqui)** commented [Aug 22, 2024](#issue-2481239368) • edited Loading

The SilverpeasBeanDAO interface allows to pass directy an SQL where clause to filter the beans to get or to remove. This is an open door to SQL injection and we cannot account to the UI or to the service layer to check the where clause. Some of the where clauses come from directly the web layer and as such a user can rewrite the clause before this one is sent to Silverpeas.

In order to avoid this vulnerability, the direct where clause is replaced by a BeanCriterion that imposes the business layers to decode the expectations coming from the web layer into a BeanCriterion before passing it to the SilverpeasBeanDAO object.

Because, the value of a criterion can be subquery dedicated to attempt an attack, BeanCriterion uses a PreparedStatement in which the parameters are set by using the corresponding interface of the PreparedStatement. This would prevent such attempts because it encodes the textual values.

[**SQL Injection (Union-Based and Time-Based).md**](#file-sql-injection-union-based-and-time-based-md)

# SQL Injection (Union-Based and Time-Based)

## **Description**

The application’s reliance on weak SQL query construction and inadequate input validation has introduced a critical vulnerability to SQL injection attacks. This flaw allows attackers to exploit union-based and time-based techniques to manipulate SQL queries, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, and compromise the database's integrity. The vulnerability was identified in the **"ViewType"** parameter, which lacks proper sanitization and validation, enabling malicious payloads to bypass security mechanisms. Key functions such as **findByWhereClause** further contribute to the issue by directly integrating unsanitized user input into SQL statements.

---

## **Summary**

The identified SQL injection vulnerability in the application's **Taxonomy** module poses a **critical risk** to sensitive data and operational continuity. Attackers can execute unauthorized queries, exfiltrate sensitive data, and disrupt database operations using union-based and time-based techniques. Immediate implementation of parameterized queries, rigorous input validation, and secure coding practices is essential to mitigate this risk and prevent catastrophic data breaches.

---

## **Steps to Reproduce**

1. **Access the Application**

   * Log in with a **SilverAdmin** account.
2. **Navigate to Taxonomy**

   * Go to **Back office > Taxonomy > Axis** and inspect the "Primary topics" view.
3. **Inject Payloads into the "ViewType" Parameter**

   * **Time-Based Injection Payload:**

     ```
     P'%3bSelect+PG_SLEEP(10)--
     ```

     Observe the delayed server response to confirm the vulnerability.
   * **Union-Based Injection Payload:**

     ```
     PP%27++UNION+SELECT+NULL::integer,NULL::character(1),NULL::character+varying(10),NULL::character+varying(255),(select+database_to_xml(true,true,%27%27)::character+varying+as+xml_representation),NULL::character(2),NULL::character+varying(255),9,9--+Test
     ```

     This payload successfully extracts sensitive database information, including user credentials.
4. **Observe the Results**

   * Verify delayed responses for time-based payloads or data leaks from union-based payloads.
