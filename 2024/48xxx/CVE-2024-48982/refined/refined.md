The provided content relates to CVE-2024-48982.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflows in `hciEvtProcessCmdCmpl` when calculating the size of the buffer to allocate for an incoming HCI command packet.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Integer Underflow:** When the length of the packet body (`len`) is less than 3, subtracting 3 from it results in an underflow when `remainingLen` is calculated as `len - 3`. This leads to a very large value for `remainingLen` when it is stored as an 8-bit integer.
2.  **Integer Overflow:**  The size of the message buffer (`msgSize`) is calculated by adding `remainingLen` to the size of a structure (`structSize`), both stored as 8-bit integers. When the sum exceeds the maximum value of a `uint8_t`, it results in a small `msgSize`, while the `memcpy` copies `remainingLen` bytes to this buffer, causing a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A buffer overflow occurs when `memcpy` copies data into the allocated buffer. This can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory regions and execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can craft a malicious HCI command packet with a carefully chosen length field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send malicious HCI command packets to the vulnerable system.
