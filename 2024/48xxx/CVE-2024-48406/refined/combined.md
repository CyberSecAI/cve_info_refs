| the function in `src/uct_upstream.c` which is shown below may have arithmetic overflow vulnerability.  ``` static uct_inline uct_int_t power(uct_int_t x, uct_int_t n) {     if (n == 0)         return 1;     int res = power(x, n / 2);     if (n % 2 != 0)         return res * res * x;     else         return res * res; }  ```  Multiplication result converted to larger type: The code that converts the result of an integer multiplication to a larger type. Since the conversion applies after the multiplication, arithmetic overflow may still occur. |

| Hey [@SunBK201](https://github.com/SunBK201) , Thank you for your reply about this issue which is detected by our tools. Now I really want to know your thoughts about our tool. When you have a chance, could you please take a look at our tool? Specifically, we're interested in understanding:   1. Do you feel the detection results from our tool help enhance the security of your project? 2. Would you be willing to let us regularly scan your project in the future to identify potential vulnerabilities? 3. Our tool works by collecting patches from existing publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in real time and scanning target projects for the presence of identical code or similar logic. Do you have any suggestions for improving this vulnerability detection approach?    Please feel free to tell me your thoughts, it's really important for us to improve our tool. Thank you! |

| Thank you for helping umicat find vulnerabilities. I am very interested in your tool and would like to share my thoughts and suggestions.   1. Regarding the detection results, I do feel they significantly help enhance the security of my project. Being able to identify potential vulnerabilities early is extremely valuable to us. 2. I would be more than willing to allow your tool to regularly scan my project to identify potential vulnerabilities. This proactive approach helps us to address issues before they escalate. 3. As for your detection method, collecting patches from publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and scanning projects for identical or similar logic is a very effective strategy. However, the availability of patches for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities can be an issue. |
