The content relates to CVE-2024-48406.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `power` function in `src/uct_upstream.c` has an integer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the multiplication `res * res` and `res * res * x` are performed before being converted to a larger type, which means the intermediate results can overflow if the base `x` and exponent `n` are sufficiently large.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow vulnerability in the `power` function due to performing multiplications before type conversion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could lead to incorrect results or undefined behavior. The exact impact would depend on how the `power` function's results are used within the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can provide a large base `x` and/or exponent `n` to the `power` function to trigger the integer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input values of `x` and `n` used in the vulnerable `power` function. This likely means that they need to have control of the calling code or parameters to the calling code of the function.
