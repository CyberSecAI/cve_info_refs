The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities, one of which is CVE-2024-48530:

**CVE-2024-48530: Authenticated Potential DoS in Instructor Appointment Availability**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of user-supplied date parameters in the Instructor Appointment Availability module. Specifically, manipulating the `date10_month` parameter by adding a single quote (e.g. `09'`) results in the system defaulting to 1970 as the start date for generating an HTML table of appointments.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Lack of input validation for date parameters.
    *   The application attempts to generate a large HTML table based on the manipulated date range.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - The server becomes unresponsive due to the excessive resource consumption when generating the large HTML output, potentially impacting all users. This is triggered by an authenticated user.
    *   The excessive output generated can be 250 MB or larger.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A crafted POST request to the Instructor Appointment Availability page with a modified `date10_month` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to have a valid user account with access to the Instructor Appointment Availability module of the application.
    *   The attacker also needs to be able to send POST requests to the server.
