- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient isolation of components that execute code. Components with code functionality are executed on the local machine without sandboxing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to lack of sandboxing for code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Unauthorized access, data manipulation, or control over the affected system through arbitrary command execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The RCE can be exploited through components that execute code locally without sandbox restrictions, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote attacker can execute code on a vulnerable system.
