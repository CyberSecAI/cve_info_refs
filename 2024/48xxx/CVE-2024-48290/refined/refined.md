{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by sending a mutated RFU (Reserved for Future Use) value of either 7 or 5 in the LL Terminate Ind PDU to a Realtek BLE device.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The device becomes unresponsive to reconnections after receiving the mutated PDU, indicating a stack overflow vulnerability. The unexpected RFU values likely trigger a processing error in the device's firmware.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The primary impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, rendering the affected BLE device unusable and unable to reconnect.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is sending a crafted LL Terminate Ind PDU with the mutated RFU values over the air via Bluetooth Low Energy.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be within the Bluetooth communication range of the vulnerable device and have the capability to craft and send BLE packets with specific content (the mutated RFU values in the LL Terminate Ind PDU)."
