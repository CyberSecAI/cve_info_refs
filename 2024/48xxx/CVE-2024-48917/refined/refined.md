Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a bypass of the XXE protection mechanism in PHPSpreadsheet's `XmlScanner` class. The `findCharSet` method uses regexes to determine the encoding of the XML file, but these regexes can be bypassed by using a UTF-7 encoding along with a crafted comment at the end of the XML file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient input validation:** The `XmlScanner` class fails to properly sanitize XML input, specifically regarding the encoding declaration in the XML header. The regex-based approach to detect encoding is flawed and can be circumvented.
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The application processes external entities in the XML document, which is a classic XXE vulnerability. This is because the XML parser is not configured to prevent external entity resolution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read local files, which can contain sensitive data such as passwords, private user data, system files like `/etc/passwd`, or even files on the windows filesystem like `c:\boot.ini`.
- **Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The attacker can cause the server to make arbitrary HTTP requests to internal or external systems, leading to the disclosure of internal content or launching CSRF attacks against internal services, and port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the PHP "expect" module is loaded, it may be possible to achieve RCE.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted XML File:** The attacker crafts an Excel file (XLSX), which internally contains XML files such as `workbook.xml`. This XML file has the XXE payload and the crafted encoding, that bypasses the `XmlScanner`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious XLSX file to the vulnerable system running the PHPSpreadsheet.
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability, as simply processing the crafted file leads to exploitation.
- No specific privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability

**Technical Details:**

*   The bypass occurs due to the `findCharSet` method's regex failing to identify that the encoding is set to UTF-7 within the XML header as it was surrounded by single quotes while the regex is looking for double quotes, which are then bypassed by adding a comment at the end that contains encoding using double quotes which is caught by the first regex.
*   The attacker can embed an XML External Entity (XXE) payload in the `workbook.xml` file.
*  The vulnerable code resides in the `src/PhpSpreadsheet/Reader/Security/XmlScanner.php` file.
*   The proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability by causing an HTTP request when the file is loaded.
* The CVE ID assigned to this vulnerability is CVE-2024-48917.

This vulnerability is rated as high severity due to the potential for significant impact, including information disclosure, SSRF and RCE.
