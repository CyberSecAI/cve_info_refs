The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WebLaudos application, version 20.8 (118).

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to XSS due to insufficient input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via the `url_redir` parameter of the `login.asp` page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Cookie exfiltration: The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript on the victim's browser, enabling them to steal session cookies.
- Account compromise: Stolen cookies can be used to impersonate the victim and gain access to their account.
- Potential for further attacks: The attacker could potentially perform other malicious actions through the compromised account.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The victim visits the crafted URL, which triggers the execution of the malicious JavaScript within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload and have the victim access that URL through a web browser. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability, however, a valid session token will increase the attack impact.
