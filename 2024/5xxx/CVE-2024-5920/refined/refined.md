- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically stored XSS (CWE-79, CAPEC-592).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can impersonate a legitimate PAN-OS administrator, gaining the ability to perform restricted actions on the PAN-OS node after the execution of malicious JavaScript in the legitimate administrator's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated read-write Panorama administrator pushes a specially crafted configuration to a PAN-OS node.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated read-write Panorama administrator. They do not need to be present on the device directly, as they can push a configuration remotely. User interaction is required by the targeted admin.
