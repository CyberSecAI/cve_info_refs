- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A blind XML External Entities (XXE) injection vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611), leading to XML Entity Linking (CAPEC-201). Specifically, a blind XXE injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can exfiltrate arbitrary files from the firewall to an attacker-controlled server.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the firewall's management interface is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and have network access to the firewall management interface.
