- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of PIC files due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data. This can lead to a write operation before the start of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve remote code execution within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely. User interaction is required, either by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious PIC file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious PIC file or lure the victim to a malicious page that exploits the vulnerability through a PIC file.
