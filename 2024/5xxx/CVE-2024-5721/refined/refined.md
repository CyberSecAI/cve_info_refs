  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Missing authentication for the cluster HTTP API.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of root on the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending requests to the cluster HTTP API on TCP port 1924.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated and needs network access to the vulnerable service on port 1924."
