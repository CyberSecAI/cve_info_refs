The provided content is related to CVE-2024-5720.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the HTTP API implementation of Logsign Unified SecOps Platform.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system call.
- Authentication bypass: The existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed, although the advisory doesn't specify how.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected Logsign Unified SecOps Platform installation.
- Privilege Escalation: The attacker can execute code in the context of root, gaining full system control.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The vulnerability is accessible through the network via the HTTP API.
- Exploitable via API: The vulnerability exists within the API implementation, making it exploitable through API calls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker can be remote.
- Low privilege: Although authentication is required, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. So, the attacker needs low privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
