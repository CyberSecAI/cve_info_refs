- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape certain settings, which allows for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (such as an Admin) can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user such as an Admin, access the plugin settings page, and inject the malicious payload (JavaScript) into the "Hide text" field. The XSS payload is then executed when a user views a post containing the table of contents.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative or equivalent privileges within the WordPress installation to access the plugin settings and modify them.
