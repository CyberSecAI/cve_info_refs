- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before it's used to execute a system call within the HTTP API implementation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability. Insufficient input validation leads to the execution of arbitrary code through a system call.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of root on the affected Logsign Unified SecOps Platform.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote through the HTTP API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Although authentication is required, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. An attacker can leverage the vulnerability through the HTTP API to inject and execute system commands with root privileges.
