Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from missing access checks in the REST API of the "The Events Calendar" WordPress plugin. This oversight allows unauthenticated users to access information about password-protected events.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The REST API endpoints for events do not properly enforce access control, leading to sensitive data exposure. Specifically, the event details should not be accessible without proper authentication when the event is password-protected.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The vulnerability results in the disclosure of details regarding password-protected events to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can view the details of password-protected events without needing to know the password or have any level of authentication to the site. This could include event titles, dates, times, locations, descriptions, and any other associated information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **REST API Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploited by making requests to specific REST API endpoints of the plugin:
    *   `https://example.com/wp-json/tribe/events/v1/events/` (fixed in version 6.8.2.1)
    *  `http://example.com/wp-json/tribe/events/v1/events/<event-id>` (fixed in version 6.5.0.1)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to have any valid user account on the WordPress site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only requires network access to the website to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Sensitive Data Disclosure".
*   The issue is categorized under OWASP's "A3: Sensitive Data Exposure" and CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor).
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.3 (medium).
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 6.8.2.1 of the plugin, with a partial fix for the single event endpoint in version 6.5.0.1.
