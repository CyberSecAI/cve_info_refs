- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key within the Logsign Unified SecOps Platform's HTTP API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hard-coded cryptographic key.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-adjacent, meaning an attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable system. The vulnerability is located within the HTTP API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be network-adjacent to the vulnerable system. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.
