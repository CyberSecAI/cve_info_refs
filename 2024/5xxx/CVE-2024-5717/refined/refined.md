- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call within the implementation of the HTTP API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation. The existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected Logsign Unified SecOps Platform installations.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access via HTTP API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the affected system. Although authentication is required, the authentication mechanism can be bypassed.
