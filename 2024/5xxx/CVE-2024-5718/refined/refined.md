- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to a lack of authentication in the cluster HTTP API, which listens on TCP port 1924 by default when enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of root.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks through the cluster HTTP API on TCP port 1924.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the affected server's TCP port 1924. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
