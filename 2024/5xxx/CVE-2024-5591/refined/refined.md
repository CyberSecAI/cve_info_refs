**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management application.
- **Triggering Error Conditions:** The attacker needs to be able to induce an error condition in the application that will cause it to display a verbose error message in the browser.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- Jazz Foundation 7.1.0
- Jazz Foundation 7.0.3
