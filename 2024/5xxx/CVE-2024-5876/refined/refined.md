- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a heap-based buffer during the parsing of PSP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires user interaction, where the target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file (specifically a PSP file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious PSP file or a malicious page that triggers the vulnerable code in IrfanView. The attacker can be remote since the attack involves a malicious file or a malicious page.
