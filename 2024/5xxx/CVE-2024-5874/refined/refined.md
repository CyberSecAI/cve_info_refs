**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PNT files within IrfanView, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:** The attack requires user interaction, where the target must either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious PNT file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious PNT file or a webpage hosting such file. The attacker can be remote since it is a remote code execution vulnerability.
