- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of JP2 files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: User needs to either visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious JP2 file to a user or cause the user to visit a malicious webpage with such a file. The user must then interact with it using Kofax Power PDF.
