- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the PAN-OS software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to use the administrative web interface as a proxy.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can view internal network resources that are not otherwise accessible.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, and an attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending requests to the vulnerable PAN-OS software instance through the administrative web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable PAN-OS instance. The WildFire Forwarding feature of the firewall must be enabled for the network to be impacted.
