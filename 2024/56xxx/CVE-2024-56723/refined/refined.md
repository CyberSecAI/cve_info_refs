Based on the provided content, the vulnerability described in the commits is related to the improper handling of IRQ domains in the `intel_soc_pmic_bxtwc` driver. Specifically, the driver was not respecting the IRQ domain when creating MFD devices, leading to issues when `platform_get_irq()` started warning on IRQ 0, which is a Linux IRQ number.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**
- The `intel_soc_pmic_bxtwc` driver was not correctly using IRQ domains when creating MFD (Multi-Function Device) devices. The driver incorrectly assumed all MFD devices shared the same IRQ domain. This resulted in the driver using a Linux IRQ number (vIRQ) instead of a domain specific one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The driver used `platform_get_irq()` which started to WARN on IRQ 0.
- Incorrect IRQ handling due to the assumption of a single IRQ domain for all MFD devices.
-  The driver was not respecting the IRQ domain when creating each MFD device separately.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact of this vulnerability was not related to security, instead, the driver would generate a warning message on IRQ 0 when `platform_get_irq()` was called. 
- The underlying issue could potentially lead to incorrect interrupt handling, which in turn can cause unpredictable system behavior and malfunction if not addressed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- There isn't a traditional attack vector associated with this. This is a flaw in the driver's logic. It was triggered due to the Linux kernel changes which caused a warning to be thrown when `platform_get_irq()` was called with IRQ 0.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker doesn't need any specific capabilities or position to exploit this. The issue is inherent in the driver's code.

**Additional Details**
- The fix involves reworking the driver to use IRQ domains when creating each MFD device separately. The driver was modified to use `bxtwc_add_chained_devices` function which takes the MFD cell, IRQ data, and the IRQ number. This is used to create separate interrupt domains for each MFD device.
- The specific files modified were `drivers/mfd/intel_soc_pmic_bxtwc.c`.
- The fix includes changes to how the BCU and ADC IRQs are handled, using the new `bxtwc_add_chained_devices` function, instead of the old `bxtwc_add_chained_irq_chip`.
- This change also involves defining separate MFD cells for BCU and ADC devices to allow them to be treated separately.
- The original commit had the following Fixes tag: `Fixes: 57129044f504 ("mfd: intel_soc_pmic_bxtwc: Use chained IRQs for second level IRQ chips")`.
