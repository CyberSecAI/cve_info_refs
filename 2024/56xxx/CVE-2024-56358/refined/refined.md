Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-56358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from two main issues:
1.  **Lack of Content Security Policy (CSP) for attachments:**  JavaScript within SVG attachments could be executed in the context of the user's current page when previewed.
2.  **Insecure handling of hyperlink URLs:**  `javascript:` URLs could be inserted into cells, leading to potential script execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The core issue is an XSS vulnerability, allowing the execution of malicious scripts within a user's session.
*   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:**  The application failed to sanitize user-provided URLs for both attachments and hyperlinks, allowing malicious code to be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Compromise:** An attacker could potentially compromise a user's account by executing malicious JavaScript through SVG attachments or crafted hyperlink URLs.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:**  With the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript, an attacker could steal sensitive data or manipulate the user's session in other ways.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Documents:** Attackers could inject malicious SVG files into attachments of documents.
*   **Crafted Hyperlinks:**  Attackers could insert malicious `javascript:` URLs into document cells, disguised as legitimate links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to create or modify documents:** An attacker needs to be able to upload attachments containing malicious SVG content and insert malicious links into cells of the document.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must preview an attachment, or click on the malicious hyperlink.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.2 of the `gristlabs/grist` docker package.
*   The fix involved adding a content security policy for attachments and sanitizing URLs to prevent `javascript:` execution.
*   The commit `a792bdc43b456dbdd6fdc50d8747f4c349fab2f4` addresses the vulnerability.
*   The fix also includes the introduction of two sanitization functions `sanitizeHttpUrl` which only allows http and https protocols and `sanitizeLinkUrl` which allows other protocols such as `mailto:` and `tel:`
*   The `DOMPurify` library is used for sanitizing the urls.
