Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection in the `/ajax/reorder.php` file of the Tasklists plugin for GLPI.
*   The code directly incorporates unsanitized POST parameters into SQL queries, specifically in the `WHERE` clause when reordering task states.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The code is vulnerable to blind SQL injection. An attacker cannot directly see the results of the query.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or properly parameterize the `$_POST` parameters before using them in SQL queries. Specifically, `$_POST['plugin_tasklists_tasktypes_id']`, `$_POST['old_order']`, and `$_POST['new_order']` are directly inserted into the SQL statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially manipulate the database.
*   Due to being a "blind" SQL injection, the attacker cannot directly see the query results but can infer based on timing or error differences.
*  The commit message "Try fix" and the diff suggest the vulnerability was present before the patch, where unsanitized input was being directly included in the SQL query string, and the fix includes using parameterized queries and casting to int.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `/ajax/reorder.php` endpoint.
*   An attacker can send a crafted POST request to this endpoint with malicious values for `plugin_tasklists_tasktypes_id`, `old_order`, and `new_order`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the database schema to craft effective SQL injection payloads.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit `6444026e3d2b8fb22d5e5ab03fb86056e1ac9e43` shows the fix for this vulnerability. It includes parameterized queries using `$DB->request` and `$DB->update`, along with explicit integer casting for input parameters, mitigating the injection.
* The affected versions are prior to 2.0.4. Version 2.0.4 contains the fix.
* The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate".

In summary, the vulnerability stems from the direct use of unsanitized user-provided data within SQL queries, enabling a blind SQL injection. The patch addresses this by using parameterized queries and explicit integer casting.
