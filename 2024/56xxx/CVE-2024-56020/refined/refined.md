- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SvegliaT Buttons plugin for WordPress, versions 1.3.0 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means that the plugin doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input before outputting it in the context of a web page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The specific nature of the vulnerability (e.g., reflected, stored) is not specified.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could inject malicious scripts (like redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts would execute when a user visits the site.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts through the plugin. Specific injection points are not provided in the description.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A contributor-level user privilege is required to exploit this vulnerability, suggesting the attack vector involves modifying content through the plugin's interface.
