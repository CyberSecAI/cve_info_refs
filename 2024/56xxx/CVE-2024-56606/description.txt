In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_packet: avoid erroring out after sock_init_data() in packet_create()

After sock_init_data() the allocated sk object is attached to the provided
sock object. On error, packet_create() frees the sk object leaving the
dangling pointer in the sock object on return. Some other code may try
to use this pointer and cause use-after-free.
