Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a recursive lock situation within the BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) subsystem of the Linux kernel. Specifically, when a stream_verdict BPF program returns `SK_PASS`, the received skb (socket buffer) is placed back into its own receive queue. This triggers a recursive locking scenario.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Recursive Lock:** The core issue is the use of `write_lock_bh` followed by a subsequent `read_lock_bh` on the same lock (`sk->sk_callback_lock`) within the data ready handling path. This occurs when a verdict program returns SK_PASS, causing the same socket's data_ready handler to be called again.
-   **Incorrect Lock Usage:** The `sk_psock_strp_data_ready` function initially uses `write_lock_bh` which was unnecessary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Operating System Deadlock:** The recursive lock leads to a deadlock, causing the operating system to become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **BPF Program:** An attacker would need to load a malicious BPF program that uses the stream_verdict functionality and returns `SK_PASS`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Privileged Access:** The attacker would need the capability to load BPF programs, typically requiring root or elevated privileges.
-   **Knowledge of BPF:** The attacker needs an understanding of BPF programming, particularly the stream_verdict program type.

**Technical Details:**

The provided code snippets show the problematic lock usage:

```
sk_psock_strp_data_ready
write_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock)
strp_data_ready
strp_read_sock
read_sock -> tcp_read_sock
strp_recv
cb.rcv_msg -> sk_psock_strp_read
# now stream_verdict return SK_PASS without peer sock assign
__SK_PASS = sk_psock_map_verd(SK_PASS, NULL)
sk_psock_verdict_apply
sk_psock_skb_ingress_self
sk_psock_skb_ingress_enqueue
sk_psock_data_ready
read_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock) <= dead lock
```

The fix involves changing `write_lock_bh` to `read_lock_bh` in `sk_psock_strp_data_ready` function which is the correct lock to be held for the operation being performed at that point in code:

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability has been present since v6.9 of the Linux kernel.
*   The fix addresses the recursive lock issue by changing `write_lock_bh` to `read_lock_bh` which eliminates the deadlock.
*   The commits provide the relevant code changes and details of the vulnerability.
