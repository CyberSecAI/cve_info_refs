In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: zynqmp_kms: Unplug DRM device before removal

Prevent userspace accesses to the DRM device from causing
use-after-frees by unplugging the device before we remove it. This
causes any further userspace accesses to result in an error without
further calls into this driver's internals.
