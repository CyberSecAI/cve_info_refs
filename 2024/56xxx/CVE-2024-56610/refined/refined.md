The provided content is related to CVE-2024-56610.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `report_filterlist_lock` spinlock in the Kernel Concurrency Sanitizer (KCSAN) debugfs interface could sleep on PREEMPT_RT kernels, which is not allowed in that context.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A non-raw spinlock (`DEFINE_SPINLOCK`) was used to protect the KCSAN report filter list, which can lead to sleeping in invalid contexts on PREEMPT_RT kernels.
- The filter list modifications via debugfs interface can potentially lead to data races.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The sleeping spinlock caused a kernel panic on PREEMPT_RT kernels, which can lead to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when KCSAN reports a data race and tries to access the filter list to determine if the report should be filtered. This access is protected by the sleeping spinlock.
- Concurrent modifications of the filter list via debugfs interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trigger a data race in the kernel while using a KCSAN-enabled PREEMPT\_RT kernel.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the debugfs interface to modify the filter list. This generally requires root or administrator level privileges.
