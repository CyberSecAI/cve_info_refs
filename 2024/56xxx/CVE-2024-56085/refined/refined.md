Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-provided input when creating Search Template Dashboards. This allows malicious users to inject template syntax that is then processed by the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**  The core vulnerability is the ability to inject code into a server-side template. This is due to the application's failure to treat user-provided data as untrusted when constructing the template.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of SSTI can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Data Breach/Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information, modify data, or cause denial of service. The CVSS vector specifies:
    *   **VC:H (Confidentiality Impact: High):** Significant unauthorized access to confidential data.
    *   **VI:L (Integrity Impact: Low):** Limited alterations to data by an unauthorized party.
    *  **VA:L (Availability Impact: Low):** Limited disruption of services.
    * **SC:L (Scope Change: Low):** A successful attack would have limited impact beyond the compromised application
    * **SI:L (Subsequent access impact: Low):** The attack has a limited impact on resources
    * **SA:L (System access impact: Low):** Limited ability to modify the systems resource

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Search Template Dashboard Creation:** The attack vector is specifically through the process of creating a "Search Template Dashboard".
*   **Payload Injection:** Attackers inject malicious code within the template creation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Logpoint platform.
*   **Access to Search Template Dashboard Creation:** The attacker needs access to the feature for creating a "Search Template Dashboard" to inject malicious content.
* **Low Privileges**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability even with low privileges.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-1336, which is "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Template Engine".
*   The issue is present in Logpoint versions prior to 7.5.0.
*   The vendor has provided a solution to mitigate this vulnerability by upgrading to version 7.5.0.
*   The CVSS v4.0 score is 5.9, which is rated as medium severity.
