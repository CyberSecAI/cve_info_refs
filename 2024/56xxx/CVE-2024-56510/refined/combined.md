### @yhatt **[yhatt](/yhatt)** commented [Jan 23, 2022](#issue-1111764098) • edited Loading

Marp Core HTML sanitizer has no longer stripped HTML comments written within HTML block. When allowed HTML by `html` constructor option, Marp Core will keep HTML comment(s) if wrapped by the HTML tag.

This behavior is helpful for user-side script usage. By wrapping JS by HTML comment, users can prevent escaping special characters in the script into HTML entities (Reported in [marp-team/marp#250](https://github.com/orgs/marp-team/discussions/250)).

```
<script>
<!--
if (1 < 2) console.log(true)
-->
</script>
```

For safety, we have not taken the approach of recognizing script context to switch whether escape or not. Users who want to use the raw inline script always must wrap the script in HTML comment.

> When HTML block is consisted by only a single HTML comment, it will be collected as the presenter note by Marpit framework.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Marp Core allows XSS by improper neutralization of HTML sanitization

Moderate

[yhatt](/yhatt)
published
GHSA-x52f-h5g4-8qv5
Dec 26, 2024

## Package

npm

@marp-team/marp-core
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 3.0.2, <= 3.9.0
4.0.0

## Patched versions

3.9.1
4.0.1

## Description

Marp Core ([`@marp-team/marp-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40marp-team/marp-core)) from v3.0.2 to v3.9.0 and v4.0.0, are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) due to improper neutralization of HTML sanitization.

### Impact

Marp Core includes an HTML sanitizer with allowlist support. In the affected versions, the built-in allowlist is enabled by default. When the allowlist is active, if insufficient HTML comments are included, the sanitizer may fail to properly sanitize HTML content and lead cross-site scripting (XSS).

### Patches

Marp Core [v3.9.1](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/releases/tag/v3.9.1) and [v4.0.1](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/releases/tag/v4.0.1) have been patched to fix that.

### Workarounds

If you are unable to update the package immediately, disable all HTML tags by setting `html: false` option in the `Marp` class constructor.

```
const marp = new Marp({ html: false })
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
