# Sandbox breakout through malicious filenames

Moderate

[davidism](/davidism)
published
GHSA-gmj6-6f8f-6699
Dec 21, 2024

## Package

pip

jinja2
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=3.1.4

## Patched versions

None

## Description

A bug in the Jinja compiler allows an attacker that controls both the content and filename of a template to execute arbitrary Python code, regardless of if Jinja's sandbox is used.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control both the filename and the contents of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates where the template author can also choose the template filename.

### Severity

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

| With this template structure:  ``` /templates/ +- {% jinja expr %}.jinja +- macro_file.jina  ```  When `{% jinja expr %}.jinja` imports a macro using 'from "macro\_file.jinja" import my\_macro' syntax, Environment.render fails with `SyntaxError: f-string: invalid syntax` error message.  Internally jinja concatenates the importing template filename into an f-string, which results with invalid f-string:  ``` if l_0_print_helo is missing:         l_0_print_helo = undefined(f"the template {included_template.__name__!r} (imported on line 1 in '{% if True %}a{%endif%}.txt.jinja') does not export the requested name 'print_helo'", name='print_helo') ```  Couldn't reproduce the error using `import "macro_file.jinja" as m` syntax.  Environment:   * Python 3.10.7 * Jinja 3.1.2 |

This is the Jinja 3.1.5 security fix release, which fixes security issues and bugs but does not otherwise change behavior and should not result in breaking changes compared to the latest feature release.

PyPI: <https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/3.1.5/>

Changes: <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/changes/#version-3-1-5>

Milestone: <https://github.com/pallets/jinja/milestone/16?closed=1>

* The sandboxed environment handles indirect calls to `str.format`, such as by passing a stored reference to a filter that calls its argument. [GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/security/advisories/GHSA-q2x7-8rv6-6q7h)
* Escape template name before formatting it into error messages, to avoid issues with names that contain f-string syntax. [#1792](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1792), [GHSA-gmj6-6f8f-6699](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/security/advisories/GHSA-gmj6-6f8f-6699)
* Sandbox does not allow `clear` and `pop` on known mutable sequence types. [#2032](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/2032)
* Calling sync `render` for an async template uses `asyncio.run`. [#1952](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1952)
* Avoid unclosed `auto_aiter` warnings. [#1960](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1960)
* Return an `aclose`-able `AsyncGenerator` from `Template.generate_async`. [#1960](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1960)
* Avoid leaving `root_render_func()` unclosed in `Template.generate_async`. [#1960](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1960)
* Avoid leaving async generators unclosed in blocks, includes and extends. [#1960](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1960)
* The runtime uses the correct `concat` function for the current environment when calling block references. [#1701](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1701)
* Make `|unique` async-aware, allowing it to be used after another async-aware filter. [#1781](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1781)
* `|int` filter handles `OverflowError` from scientific notation. [#1921](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1921)
* Make compiling deterministic for tuple unpacking in a `{% set ... %}` call. [#2021](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/2021)
* Fix dunder protocol (`copy`/`pickle`/etc) interaction with `Undefined` objects. [#2025](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/2025)
* Fix `copy`/`pickle` support for the internal `missing` object. [#2027](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/2027)
* `Environment.overlay(enable_async)` is applied correctly. [#2061](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/2061)
* The error message from `FileSystemLoader` includes the paths that were searched. [#1661](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1661)
* `PackageLoader` shows a clearer error message when the package does not contain the templates directory. [#1705](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1705)
* Improve annotations for methods returning copies. [#1880](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1880)
* `urlize` does not add `mailto:` to values like `@a@b`. [#1870](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/pull/1870)
* Tests decorated with `@pass_context` can be used with the `|select` filter. [#1624](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1624)
* Using `set` for multiple assignment (`a, b = 1, 2`) does not fail when the target is a namespace attribute. [#1413](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1413)
* Using `set` in all branches of `{% if %}{% elif %}{% else %}` blocks does not cause the variable to be considered initially undefined. [#1253](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1253)
