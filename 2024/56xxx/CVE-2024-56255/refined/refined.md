- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control, specifically missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can perform actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users. The specific impact varies on a case-by-case basis, but this could potentially allow unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through a function within the plugin lacking proper access control checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs to be a subscriber on the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.
