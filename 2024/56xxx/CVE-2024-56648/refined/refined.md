The provided content relates to CVE-2024-56648.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient check in the `fill_frame_info()` function within the High-availability Seamless Redundancy (HSR) networking implementation of the Linux kernel. Specifically, when processing VLAN-tagged packets, the function fails to ensure that the provided packet's `mac_len` is large enough to contain a complete `hsr_vlan_ethhdr` structure before accessing its members, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** If a crafted packet with a `mac_len` smaller than the size of `hsr_vlan_ethhdr` is processed, the function attempts to access members of this structure at memory locations beyond the bounds of the packet data, causing an out-of-bounds read.
- **Uninitialized value usage:** The out-of-bounds read can lead to the use of uninitialized values as the function continues to process the packet, as demonstrated by the KMSAN reports included in the commit logs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information leak:** Reading beyond the packet bounds can leak kernel memory contents to user space via the processed network packets.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The use of uninitialized values can cause the kernel to malfunction, potentially leading to a crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network packet injection:** A malicious user or process can send specially crafted network packets with a short `mac_len` while setting the vlan flag, triggering the out-of-bounds access within the `fill_frame_info()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the vulnerable system. This could be achieved through access to the network interface or by having the ability to inject packets into the network stack.

The fix introduces an additional check:
```c
if (skb->mac_len < offsetofend(struct hsr_vlan_ethhdr, vlanhdr))
    return -EINVAL;
```
This verifies that `skb->mac_len` is at least as big as the size of the `hsr_vlan_ethhdr` structure before accessing its members, preventing the out-of-bounds read.
