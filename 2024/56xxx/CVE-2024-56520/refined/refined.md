{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Improper parsing of TypeOne FontBBox data within the `addTTFfont` function of the TCPDF library. The code uses regular expressions to extract font information, specifically the FontBBox, and then parses it. The vulnerability arises from how the code handles the FontBBox string, leading to incorrect values for Ascent and Descent. This is due to an issue in the regex and parsing logic, which was also present in `tc-lib-pdf-font` and then backported to `TCPDF`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect regular expression usage for parsing",
      "Improper parsing of string data leading to incorrect values"
    ],
    "impact": "Incorrect font metrics (Ascent and Descent) can lead to text rendering issues in generated PDF documents, such as text being clipped or improperly positioned. This issue can affect the visual integrity of the generated document.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to add a TTF font using `addTTFfont`, which then processes the font data, including the potentially malformed or ambiguously formatted FontBBox string. An attacker would need to craft a specific TypeOne font that could expose this incorrect parsing logic.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to provide a specially crafted TypeOne font to the `addTTFfont` method and trigger the parsing logic within the `TCPDF` or `tc-lib-pdf-font` library."
