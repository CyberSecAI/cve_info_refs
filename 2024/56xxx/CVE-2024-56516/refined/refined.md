- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses the MD5 hashing algorithm to hash passwords before sending them to the backend.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** MD5 is a cryptographically broken hashing algorithm that is vulnerable to collision attacks and can be easily cracked using modern hardware. This makes it unsuitable for password storage or transmission.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data due to the compromised password hashes.
- **Attack vectors:** Brute force and rainbow table attacks can be used to crack the MD5 hashes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need access to the MD5 hashes of the passwords, which could be obtained through a data breach or other means.
