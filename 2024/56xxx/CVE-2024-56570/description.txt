In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ovl: Filter invalid inodes with missing lookup function

Add a check to the ovl_dentry_weird() function to prevent the
processing of directory inodes that lack the lookup function.
This is important because such inodes can cause errors in overlayfs
when passed to the lowerstack.
