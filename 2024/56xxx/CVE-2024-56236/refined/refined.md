- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin has a broken access control issue due to missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that should require higher privileges. The specific impact varies depending on the vulnerable function.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending requests to the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated, meaning that it can be exploited by any user.
