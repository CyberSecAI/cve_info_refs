# Malicious plugin names, recipients, or identities can cause arbitrary binary execution

GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c
Dec 18, 2024

## Package

gomod

filippo.io/age/plugin
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.2.1

## Patched versions

1.2.1

## Description

A plugin name containing a path separator may allow an attacker to execute an arbitrary binary.

Such a plugin name can be provided to the age CLI through an attacker-controlled recipient or identity string, or to the [`plugin.NewIdentity`](https://pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/age/plugin#NewIdentity), [`plugin.NewIdentityWithoutData`](https://pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/age/plugin#NewIdentityWithoutData), or [`plugin.NewRecipient`](https://pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/age/plugin#NewRecipient) APIs.

On UNIX systems, a directory matching `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/age-plugin-*` needs to exist for the attack to succeed.

The binary is executed with a single flag, either `--age-plugin=recipient-v1` or `--age-plugin=identity-v1`. The standard input includes the recipient or identity string, and the random file key (if encrypting) or the header of the file (if decrypting). The format is constrained by the [age-plugin](https://c2sp.org/age-plugin) protocol.

An equivalent issue was fixed by the [rage](https://github.com/str4d/rage) project, see advisory [GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w](https://github.com/str4d/rage/security/advisories/GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w).

## Package

pip

pyrage
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

1.2.0, 1.2.1, 1.2.2

## Patched versions

1.2.3

## Description

`pyrage` uses the Rust `age` crate for its underlying operations, and `age` is vulnerable to [GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w "GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w").

All details of [GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w "GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w") are relevant to `pyrage` for the versions specified in this advisory. See [GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w "GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w") for full details.

Versions of `pyrage` before 1.2.0 lack plugin support and are therefore **not affected**.

An equivalent issue was fixed in [the reference Go implementation of age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age), see advisory [GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/security/advisories/GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c).

## Description

A plugin name containing a path separator may allow an attacker to execute an arbitrary binary.

Such a plugin name can be provided to the `rage` CLI through an attacker-controlled recipient or identity string, or to the following `age` APIs when the `plugin` feature flag is enabled:

* [`age::plugin::Identity::from_str`](https://docs.rs/age/0.11.0/age/plugin/struct.Identity.html#impl-FromStr-for-Identity) (or equivalently [`str::parse::<age::plugin::Identity>()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/primitive.str.html#method.parse))
* [`age::plugin::Identity::default_for_plugin`](https://docs.rs/age/0.11.0/age/plugin/struct.Identity.html#method.default_for_plugin)
* [`age::plugin::IdentityPluginV1::new`](https://docs.rs/age/0.11.0/age/plugin/struct.IdentityPluginV1.html#method.new)
* [`age::plugin::Recipient::from_str`](https://docs.rs/age/0.11.0/age/plugin/struct.Recipient.html#impl-FromStr-for-Recipient) (or equivalently [`str::parse::<age::plugin::Recipient>()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/primitive.str.html#method.parse))
* [`age::plugin::RecipientPluginV1::new`](https://docs.rs/age/0.11.0/age/plugin/struct.RecipientPluginV1.html#method.new)

On UNIX systems, a directory matching `age-plugin-*` needs to exist in the working directory for the attack to succeed.

The binary is executed with a single flag, either `--age-plugin=recipient-v1` or `--age-plugin=identity-v1`. The standard input includes the recipient or identity string, and the random file key (if encrypting) or the header of the file (if decrypting). The format is constrained by the [age-plugin](https://c2sp.org/age-plugin) protocol.

An equivalent issue was fixed in [the reference Go implementation of age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age), see advisory [GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/security/advisories/GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c).
