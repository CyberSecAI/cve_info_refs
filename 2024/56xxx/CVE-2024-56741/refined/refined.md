  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix is to free the allocated memory using `kfree(string)` in `policy_unpack_test.c`."
  ],
  "details": "The provided code snippets show multiple commits that all resolve the same memory leak issue. The leak occurs in the `aa_unpack_strdup` function within the AppArmor policy unpack test code. The string allocated by `kmemdup()` was not being freed after its use, leading to a memory leak. The commits address this by adding `kfree(string)` to free the allocated memory, preventing memory leaks during the policy unpack test scenarios."
