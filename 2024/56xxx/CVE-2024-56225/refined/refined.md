Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a **Broken Access Control** issue within the WordPress Premium Addons for Elementor plugin. This indicates that the plugin lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in certain functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The plugin fails to properly restrict access to certain functions, allowing users with insufficient privileges to execute actions they shouldn't be able to perform. Specifically, the vulnerability allows a user with a "Contributor" role to perform actions that should be reserved for users with higher privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The impact is described as having "low severity" and "unlikely to be exploited". However, the description of Broken Access Control indicates that an unprivileged user could execute privileged actions. The specific actions that can be performed are not specified.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the plugin's vulnerable functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a WordPress user with at least "Contributor" privileges. They must also be able to somehow access or call the vulnerable functions in the plugin.
