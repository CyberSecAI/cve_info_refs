Very impressed! I've tried many panels and I like this one best AND they seem to be moving in the right direction over time. It's not quite 5 stars yet but 4 is way better than what I'd rate the other panels out there - keep up the great work!

CyberPanel support is too good. This is my first ticket with them and I seriously wasn't expecting fast and timely response for various positive reasons which are quite understood with respect to the open source platforms.
