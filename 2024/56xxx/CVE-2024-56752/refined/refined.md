Based on the provided content, all of the commits are related to the same vulnerability fix. The commits address a missing mutex unlock in the `gf100_gr_chan_new` function within the Nouveau DRM driver.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The function `gf100_gr_chan_new` acquires a mutex (`gr->fecs.mutex`) before calling `gf100_grctx_generate`. If `gf100_grctx_generate` fails, the function returns an error without releasing the mutex.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Mutex Unlock:** The primary issue is the failure to release the acquired mutex on the error path of the `gf100_gr_chan_new` function. This leads to a potential deadlock.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Deadlock:** If `gf100_grctx_generate` fails and the mutex is not released, other threads attempting to acquire the same mutex would be blocked indefinitely.
- **System Unresponsiveness:** A deadlock can lead to system unresponsiveness or a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by any scenario where `gf100_grctx_generate` fails when creating a new channel. This can happen due to various reasons, such as invalid or unexpected input data, or resource exhaustion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the Nouveau driver in a way that triggers the `gf100_gr_chan_new` function. This may require access to the graphics subsystem and capabilities to allocate and configure graphics objects.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided patch adds `mutex_unlock(&gr->fecs.mutex);` before returning an error in `gf100_gr_chan_new` function.
- The issue was identified by the 'smatch' static analysis tool which warned about "inconsistent returns" regarding the mutex.
- The commit message clearly states that it fixes a missing mutex unlock.
- The fix was backported to multiple stable kernel branches.
- This is a lock handling issue and is not a memory corruption vulnerability.
