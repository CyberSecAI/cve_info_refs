The provided content relates to a memory leak fix in the Linux kernel's NVMe-TCP driver.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The issue stems from a failure to free the tagset occupied by the admin queue when creating a new NVMe-TCP controller fails.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A memory leak occurs due to the tagset not being freed when the controller creation fails.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact is a memory leak, which, if triggered repeatedly could lead to resource exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves repeatedly attempting to create new NVMe-TCP controllers, forcing a failure in the creation process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to trigger the creation of new NVMe-TCP controllers, and cause the creation to fail. This would likely require some level of access/privilege on a system utilizing the nvme-tcp driver.

The provided patches fix the leak by ensuring the tagset is freed in the `nvme_tcp_teardown_admin_queue` function when controller creation fails.
