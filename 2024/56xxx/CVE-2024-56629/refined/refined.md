{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `wacom_update_name` function in the Wacom HID driver directly dereferences `dev->product` without checking if it is NULL, which can lead to a null pointer dereference if the USB device does not provide a product string.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A null pointer dereference can cause a system crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "Attaching a Wacom USB device that doesn't properly report a product name string.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a device that doesn't provide a product string and be able to plug it into the system."
  },
  "affected_component": "Wacom HID driver",
  "fixed_versions": [
    "The fix was introduced in commit 59548215b76be98cf3422eea9a67d6ea578aca3d"
  ],
  "details": "The provided kernel logs show a crash occurring when the kernel attempts to access the `dev->product` field, indicating a null pointer dereference. The fix adds a null check before accessing the `dev->product` field, preventing the crash."
