In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: endpoint: epf-mhi: Avoid NULL dereference if DT lacks 'mmio'

If platform_get_resource_byname() fails and returns NULL because DT lacks
an 'mmio' property for the MHI endpoint, dereferencing res->start will
cause a NULL pointer access. Add a check to prevent it.
