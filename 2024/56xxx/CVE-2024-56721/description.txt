In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/CPU/AMD: Terminate the erratum_1386_microcode array

The erratum_1386_microcode array requires an empty entry at the end.
Otherwise x86_match_cpu_with_stepping() will continue iterate the array after
it ended.

Add an empty entry to erratum_1386_microcode to its end.
