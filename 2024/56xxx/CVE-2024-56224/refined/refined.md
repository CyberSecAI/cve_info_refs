- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Ledenbeheer plugin for WordPress versions 2.1.0 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts are executed when guests visit the site, potentially leading to user compromise, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized, which leads to the execution of arbitrary Javascript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts through user-supplied input, which can be achieved with contributor access.
