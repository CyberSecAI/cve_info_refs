- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Flash News / Post (Responsive) WordPress plugin lacks proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF. This allows an attacker to potentially force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions without their consent.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on the WordPress site, potentially including modification of content, settings, or other sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website, which would then send a forged request to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into initiating a malicious request.
