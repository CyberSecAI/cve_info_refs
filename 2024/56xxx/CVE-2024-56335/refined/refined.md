- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls related to organization groups. An attacker with user account and admin or owner permissions in an unrelated organization is able to update or delete groups from another organization if they know the target organization's UUID and the target group's UUID.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management): The system does not properly manage privileges, allowing unauthorized actions on organization groups.
    - CWE-284 (Improper Access Control): The system fails to restrict access to sensitive operations on organization groups, allowing users to modify data they should not have access to.
    - CWE-285 (Improper Authorization): The system does not correctly authorize operations on organization groups, leading to unauthorized modifications.
    - CWE-287 (Improper Authentication): While not directly related to user authentication, the vulnerability implies that the system does not properly authenticate/authorize the user's actions in the context of the target organization group.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of service: Attackers can remove users from groups, preventing them from accessing the organization's data.
    - Privilege escalation: Attackers within the victim organization can elevate their own privileges by joining groups they wouldn't normally have access to.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based exploitation
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must have a user account on the server.
    - The attacker must have admin or owner permissions in an unrelated organization.
    - The attacker must know the target organization's UUID and the target group's UUID.
