{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the sockmap implementation where replacing a socket map element can race with the socket's close operation and subsequent unlinking. This leads to the `__sock_map_delete()` function unconditionally unreferencing the wrong socket, potentially a dangling pointer",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race Condition",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A use-after-free vulnerability can lead to a kernel crash, potential privilege escalation, and denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local attacker with the ability to create and manipulate BPF sockmaps, create and close sockets, and update map elements. Requires precise timing to trigger the race condition.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to create and manipulate BPF sockmaps, create and close sockets, and update map elements. Requires precise timing to trigger the race condition."
