- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control. Unprivileged users can execute privileged actions due to the missing checks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could potentially perform actions that should be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies depending on the functionality affected.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a function that lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A user with the "Subscriber" role is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.
