- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The AD7923 driver was updated to support devices with 8 channels, but the sizes of `tx_buf` and `ring_xfer` were not updated accordingly.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow in the `ad7923_update_scan_mode()` function due to insufficient buffer sizes for `tx_buf` and `ring_xfer`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A buffer overflow could lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when updating the scan mode of the AD7923 device, which can be done by a user with access to the device's interface within the Linux kernel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have the ability to interact with the AD7923 device interface within the Linux kernel.
