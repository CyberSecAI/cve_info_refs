The provided content relates to a fix for a memory leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's EFI stub.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `efi_handle_cmdline` function in `drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/efi-stub.c` was incorrectly freeing memory on failure. Specifically, it was attempting to free `cmdline_ptr`, which is an output parameter pointing to the caller's stack, rather than `cmdline`, which points to the allocated memory pool for the command line.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect memory deallocation
- Memory leak on failure to process the command line

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory leak, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or other memory-related issues

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious or malformed command line arguments provided via EFI

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to influence the command line arguments provided during the EFI boot process. This likely requires control of the boot process or the ability to modify the boot configuration.
