Based on the provided information, the content relates to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper cleanup process in the `ath12k` driver when handling self-peers during core halt. Specifically, the Rx TID cleanup routine is executed for self-peers, even though the necessary data structures are not initialized for them, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of self-peers in the cleanup process
- Accessing uninitialized or null data structures.
- Lack of check to differentiate between regular and self-peers before attempting a cleanup.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash due to a null pointer dereference
- System instability
- Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the device core halt/reset process in the `ath12k` driver.
- No specific external attack vector is mentioned but it seems to be tied to the driver's handling of self peers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker doesn't need to be in a privileged position.
- The attacker will need to be able to trigger a core halt in the `ath12k` driver.
- The attack can be initiated once the driver is loaded and running, leading to a crash when it needs to halt/reset
- This is more likely to be a bug than something triggered intentionally by an attacker.

The provided patches address the issue by skipping Rx TID cleanup for self-peers using a check for peer::sta before executing the cleanup. This resolves the crash.
