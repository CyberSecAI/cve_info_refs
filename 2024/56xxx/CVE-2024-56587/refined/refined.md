{
  "CVE-2024-56587": [
    {
      "Root cause": "A race condition exists in the Linux kernel's LED class driver when accessing the brightness and max_brightness attributes of an LED device. This occurs when a hid device is being added (Process A), leading to the creation of a led_cdev, and concurrently another process (Process B) attempts to access the led_cdev attributes. Due to lack of proper locking, a NULL pointer dereference can happen.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Race Condition",
        "NULL Pointer Dereference"
      ],
      "Impact": "Kernel NULL pointer dereference, leading to a system crash.",
      "Attack vectors": "Concurrent access to the LED class device attributes from different processes.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to trigger a specific sequence of events where a hid device is added and, concurrently, another process attempts to read the LED device attributes."
