The provided content relates to CVE-2024-56582.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a race condition in the `btrfs_encoded_read_endio()` function within the Btrfs file system. The issue stems from the use of `atomic_dec_return()` which is not an atomic operation on x86_64, followed by a conditional check in `btrfs_encoded_read_endio()`. This can lead to a race condition where the counter is decremented, but the conditional test for zero is not yet completed. In the meantime, if `btrfs_encoded_read_regular_fill_pages()` is executed by another thread, it might observe the decremented counter and prematurely free the private data.  Later, when the conditional check in `btrfs_encoded_read_endio()` completes and succeeds, it tries to wake up a wait queue that has been freed, resulting in a use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Race Condition:** The use of `atomic_dec_return()` in conjunction with a conditional check creates a race condition
- **Use-After-Free:** The race condition can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability when the wait queue is freed prematurely.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel crash:** The use-after-free can lead to a kernel crash.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution**: Although not explicitly stated, use-after-free vulnerabilities can often be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- **File System Operations:** The vulnerability is triggered through operations involving the `BTRFS_IOC_ENCODED_READ` ioctl, likely during file read operations on a Btrfs file system.
- **Concurrency:** The race condition requires multiple threads to be interacting with the Btrfs file system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local access:** The attacker requires local access to the system.
- **File system access:** The attacker must have the ability to trigger operations on a Btrfs file system that use the `BTRFS_IOC_ENCODED_READ` ioctl.
- **Concurrency**: The attacker needs to trigger concurrent operations within the btrfs filesystem to exploit the race condition.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `btrfs_encoded_read_endio()` function, which is part of the end I/O handler for encoded reads in Btrfs.
- The fix replaces `atomic_dec_return()` with `atomic_dec_and_test()`, which ensures that the decrement and the test for zero are performed as a single atomic operation.
- The provided content includes a detailed crash report, including call traces, memory state, and allocated and freed locations, which was used to diagnose the issue.
- The vulnerable code was introduced in commit `1881fba89bd5 ("btrfs: add BTRFS_IOC_ENCODED_READ ioctl")`.
