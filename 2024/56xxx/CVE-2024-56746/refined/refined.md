{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `sh7760fb_free_mem()` function was not correctly freeing memory allocated by `dma_alloc_coherent()` when `info->screen_base` was not initialized. This caused a memory leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect memory management",
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "impact": "Memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion if the allocation and failure condition occur repeatedly. This could lead to system instability.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the framebuffer allocation within the sh7760fb driver. Specifically, this occurs when the driver receives memory that is unusable for the LCDC and attempts to free it. The attacker needs to trigger the allocation of framebuffer memory in this driver and also cause the condition where the allocated memory address is unsuitable for the LCDC.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the capability to trigger the framebuffer allocation in the sh7760fb driver and control the system environment such that the allocated memory is unsuitable for the LCDC. This typically means that the attacker needs to be able to load or configure the driver and its underlying hardware."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix replaces the call to `sh7760fb_free_mem()` with a call to `dma_free_coherent()` to correctly release the memory allocated by `dma_alloc_coherent()`."
  ],
  "details": "The provided content contains multiple commits that fix a memory leak in the `sh7760fb` framebuffer driver. The core issue lies in the `sh7760fb_alloc_mem()` function, where if the allocated DMA memory address is not suitable for the LCDC, the driver should free the allocated memory. However, the `sh7760fb_free_mem()` function does not correctly release memory under specific circumstances; it does not handle freeing memory allocated by dma_alloc_coherent properly. The correction involves replacing the call to the custom memory freeing function with the appropriate `dma_free_coherent()`."
