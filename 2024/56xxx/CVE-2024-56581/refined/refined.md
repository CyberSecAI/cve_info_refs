  "cveId": "CVE-2024-56581",
  "description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability occurs in the `btrfs_ref_tree_mod()` function. When a new reference entry is added to a block entry's rbtree, and an unexpected `BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF` action is encountered, the code errors out and frees the reference entry without removing it from the rbtree. This leads to a use-after-free condition when `btrfs_free_ref_cache()` iterates over block entries and calls `free_block_entry()` which accesses the freed reference through the rbtree.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Incorrect error handling"
    ],
    "impact": "A use-after-free vulnerability can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attackVector": "The vulnerability can be triggered by creating specific conditions within the Btrfs file system that result in the unexpected `BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF` action during modification of reference trees.",
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to interact with the Btrfs filesystem by triggering operations that involve reference modifications, such as file deletion or balance operations."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix involves removing the newly added reference entry from the rbtree before freeing it in the error path of `btrfs_ref_tree_mod()` using `rb_erase(&ref->node, &be->refs);`"
