Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of custom properties when generating HTML output in the `PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Html` class. Specifically, the `generateMeta` method does not sanitize the custom property key, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code. Also, the hyperlink base and url are not sanitized properly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) due to improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- Unsanitized custom property keys in meta tags.
- Unsanitized hyperlink base.
- Unsanitized hyperlink URLs, allowing javascript: scheme.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a user's browser when they view a specially crafted Excel file converted to HTML using PhpSpreadsheet. This could lead to:
- Session hijacking.
- Stealing cookies.
- Defacing the webpage.
- Redirecting the user to a malicious site.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious Excel file (.xlsx) with a custom property containing an XSS payload, or a malicious hyperlink base/url.
- The server uses PhpSpreadsheet to convert the malicious .xlsx file into HTML.
- The victim opens the generated HTML in a browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious .xlsx file and have it processed by a vulnerable server.
- The vulnerable server must use a vulnerable version of PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet to generate HTML output of the spreadsheet.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Html` class, specifically in the `generateMeta` method, and the code handling hyperlink base and URLs.
- The fix involves additional sanitization of special characters in the custom property key and other mentioned fields.
- The vulnerability affects versions >= 3.0.0, < 3.7.0; <= 1.29.6; >= 2.0.0, <= 2.1.5; >= 2.2.0, <= 2.3.4 and is fixed in versions 3.7.0, 1.29.7, 2.1.6, and 2.3.5.
- The vulnerability is rated as moderate, with a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.4 and CVSS v4.0 score of 4.8.
- The attacker can embed the XSS payload within the `docProps/custom.xml` file inside the .xlsx archive.
- The exploit requires user interaction. The user has to open the generated html page to trigger the XSS.
