Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-56364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `SimpleXLSXEx::readThemeColors`, `SimpleXLSXEx::getColorValue` and `SimpleXLSX::toHTMLEx` methods of the `simplexlsx` library. Specifically, these methods were not properly sanitizing color values extracted from the Excel file before using them in HTML output via `toHTMLEx`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core vulnerability is that the code allows the injection of arbitrary JavaScript through color values in the Excel file that are then used in the toHTMLEx output. 
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize or validate the color values read from the Excel file before incorporating them into HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view the HTML generated by `toHTMLEx`.
- This can lead to various impacts, such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Phishing attacks
    - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user
    - Data theft
- The vulnerability has a scope change because the vulnerable component (simplexlsx) can impact resources beyond its security scope by affecting users' browsers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Excel File: An attacker crafts a specially crafted Excel file that contains malicious JavaScript within the color values.
- `toHTMLEx` method: When the `toHTMLEx` method is used to display content from the malicious excel file, the unsanitized color values are interpreted as javascript.
- User Interaction: A user needs to open or view the HTML output generated by the vulnerable application via `toHTMLEx` to trigger the XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a malicious Excel file
- Ability to somehow cause the target application to use the `toHTMLEx` method and to deliver the crafted excel file to the application.
- Ability to cause a user to view the generated HTML output.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 6.8.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.1.13 of the library.
- The commit log shows that the fix involved modifying `SimpleXLSXEx.php` to implement proper sanitization or validation of color values, specifically using `preg_match('/^[A-F0-9]{6}$/')` to validate the hex color codes before use.
- The "Workarounds" section suggests avoiding the use of `toHTMLEx`.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Aleksey Solovev (Positive Technologies).

In summary, the vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability within the `simplexlsx` library, stemming from the lack of sanitization of color values when generating HTML output, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript.
