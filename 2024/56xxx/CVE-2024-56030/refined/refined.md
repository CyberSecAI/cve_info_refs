- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper input sanitization or output encoding, allowing a malicious actor to inject arbitrary scripts into the website.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to:
  - Redirects to malicious websites
  - Display of unwanted advertisements
  - Other HTML payloads being executed, potentially leading to further compromise
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
