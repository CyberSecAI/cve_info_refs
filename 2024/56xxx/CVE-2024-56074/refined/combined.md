### @nollium **[nollium](/nollium)** commented [Dec 12, 2024](#issue-2736341557) • edited Loading

Hello, this PR fixes some bugs that might lead to security-related issues:

1. Run the docker installation using an unprivileged user
2. Add some recursion and size limits to prevent DOS
3. Fix some bugs related to symbolic links
4. Add a missing dependency to requirements.txt

Sorry, something went wrong.
