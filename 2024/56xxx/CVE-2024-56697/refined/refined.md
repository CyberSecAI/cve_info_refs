Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2024-56697.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a memory allocation issue within the `amdgpu_discovery_get_nps_info()` function in the AMDGPU driver. Specifically, it involves two problems: a missing check for allocation failure and the potential for multiplication overflow during memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Missing Null Pointer Check**: The code initially lacked a check to determine if the memory allocation for `mem_ranges` was successful. Failing to do so could lead to a null pointer dereference if `kvzalloc()` failed and returned NULL.
2.  **Integer Overflow**: The size of the memory allocation was calculated using `*range_cnt * sizeof(struct amdgpu_gmc_memrange)`. If `range_cnt` is sufficiently large, this multiplication can overflow leading to allocating a smaller buffer than required, potentially causing a heap overflow during usage.
3. **Incorrect Output Parameter Modification:** The output parameters `nps_type` and `range_cnt` are assigned before checking for memory allocation failures. In case of an allocation error, these parameters would be modified even if the function fails.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   If the memory allocation fails due to lack of memory or a large value for range\_cnt and is not handled correctly, the subsequent dereference of the null pointer could lead to a crash or denial-of-service.
-  If the allocation size is smaller due to integer overflow, writing to the allocated `mem_ranges` could lead to a heap overflow corrupting memory and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
-   A malicious or specially crafted input that causes `nps_info->v1.count` to be very large could trigger the integer overflow leading to a heap overflow.
-   A system under memory pressure might cause the `kvzalloc` call to fail, leading to null pointer dereference if not checked.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need the ability to control or influence the `nps_info` structure passed to `amdgpu_discovery_get_nps_info`. This could involve having control over the device configuration or utilizing a driver flaw to manipulate the data structures.
