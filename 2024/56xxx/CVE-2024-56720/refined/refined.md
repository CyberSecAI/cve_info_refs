Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2024-56720** relates to multiple fixes for the `bpf_msg_pop_data` function in the Linux kernel, specifically within the `net/core/filter.c` file. This function is used in the context of BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) and sockmap, which are kernel features for network packet processing. The fixes address several issues that could lead to unexpected behavior, memory leaks, or potential exploits.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in multiple flaws within the implementation of `bpf_msg_pop_data` and related functions, specifically in how it manages scatter-gather lists (`sk_msg`) representing network messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Missing `put_page()` in `sk_msg_shift_left`:** The function `sk_msg_shift_left` was not releasing the page associated with the scatterlist element when shifting left, resulting in a memory leak.
2. **Lack of early return for zero length pop:** The `bpf_msg_pop_data` function did not have an early exit when the length to pop (`len`) was zero, leading to unnecessary processing.
3. **Incorrect handling of full pop:** The function did not correctly handle the case when the entire `sk_msg` was being popped (where `last` equals `msg->sg.size`).
4. **Incorrect variable calculation:** The variable `a` was incorrectly initialized as `start` instead of `start - offset`, leading to incorrect length calculations when popping data from the middle of the message.
5. **Double Iteration in `sk_msg_shift_left`:** The `sk_msg_shift_left` function had a redundant iterator increment using `sk_msg_iter_var_next` which could cause a kernel BUG.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Memory leaks:** Due to the missing `put_page()` call, repeated usage could lead to memory exhaustion.
- **Incorrect data handling:**  Incorrect variable calculations can cause the function to miscalculate the length of the data to be removed, possibly leading to data corruption, unexpected behavior, or even crashes.
- **Kernel Panic:** Incorrect iteration and incorrect logic can cause kernel bugs.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting specific network packets and using BPF programs to trigger the vulnerable `bpf_msg_pop_data` function with specific parameters.
- BPF programs need to be loaded into the kernel which requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to load BPF programs into the kernel, typically requiring `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capabilities or similar privileges.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the internal BPF and socket message structure to craft specific BPF programs that trigger the vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content shows multiple commits that address this vulnerability. The core fix is within commit `5d609ba262475db450ba69b8e8a557bd768ac07a`. The other commits backport this fix to stable kernel branches.
- The fix includes changes to `sk_msg_shift_left`, adding `put_page(sg_page(sge))` to address the memory leak, adding an early return when len is 0, correcting the calculation of variable `a` as `start - offset`, adding support for `last > msg->sg.size` and removing the redundant iteration in `sk_msg_shift_left`.
- The fixes prevent memory leaks, data corruption, kernel bugs and potential exploitable scenarios.
