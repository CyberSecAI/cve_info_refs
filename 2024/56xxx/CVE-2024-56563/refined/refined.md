The provided content relates to a fix for a credential leak in the Linux kernel's Ceph filesystem implementation, specifically within the `ceph_mds_check_access()` function. This aligns with the description of CVE-2024-56563 as a potential security vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `ceph_mds_check_access()` function was missing a call to `put_cred()` after calling `get_current_cred()`. `get_current_cred()` increments the reference counter for the credential, and a corresponding `put_cred()` is necessary to decrement the reference counter when the credential is no longer needed. Without this, the credential's reference count never reaches zero, resulting in a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Credential leak: The missing `put_cred()` call causes a memory leak because the reference count on the current credential is not decremented properly.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A credential leak will lead to memory exhaustion if triggered repeatedly. This can result in a denial of service where the system runs out of memory resources, and potentially impacts the stability of the system using ceph filesystem.

**Attack vectors:**
- This vulnerability is triggered when the `ceph_mds_check_access()` function is called, which is part of the Ceph client's access control mechanism.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to trigger the execution of the `ceph_mds_check_access()` function within a system that has the vulnerable Ceph client module loaded. This could be accomplished by making a large number of filesystem access requests that would invoke the check. The specific privilege needed would depend on the context and the specific setup of the ceph system.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided diffstat shows that the fix adds `put_cred(cred)` in two different code paths within `ceph_mds_check_access()` to address the leak.
- The commits indicate the fix has been applied to the stable branches of the Linux kernel.
- The vulnerability is introduced by commit `596afb0b8933 ("ceph: add ceph_mds_check_access() helper")`.
