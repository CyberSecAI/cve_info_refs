Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-56357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of URLs used in custom widget configurations and form redirects within the Grist application. Specifically, the application did not restrict the URL schemes to only `http:` or `https:`, allowing the use of `javascript:` URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By injecting `javascript:` URLs into custom widget URLs or form redirect URLs, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser session when they interact with a malicious document or form.
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The application failed to validate and sanitize URL inputs, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to the compromise of user accounts, as the attacker could execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's session. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data within the application or manipulate it by executing arbitrary javascript.
- **Malicious Redirects:** While the primary focus is XSS, the vulnerability also allows for redirects to malicious websites via form submissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Document:** An attacker could craft a malicious document containing a custom widget with a `javascript:` URL. When a user opens this document, the malicious script would be executed.
- **Malicious Form:** An attacker could configure a form with a `javascript:` redirect URL. Upon form submission, the malicious script would be executed, or the user would be redirected to a malicious site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create/Modify Documents or Forms:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify documents or forms within the Grist application to inject the malicious URLs.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to interact with the malicious document or form. This interaction includes opening the document or submitting the form.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix implemented involves restricting custom widget URLs and form redirect URLs to only `http(s)` schemes.
- The provided commit diff shows the code changes that implement the sanitization logic using the `sanitizeUrl` function. This function ensures that only URLs with valid `http:` or `https:` schemes are allowed.
- The commit also includes new unit tests to verify the correct behavior of the sanitization logic, along with end-to-end browser tests that confirm that invalid URLs are handled correctly.
