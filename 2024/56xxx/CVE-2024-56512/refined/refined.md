{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Missing fine-grained authorization checking when creating new Process Groups for Parameter Contexts, referenced Controller Services, and referenced Parameter Providers.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insufficient authorization checks for Parameter Contexts: When a new Process Group was created and bound to a Parameter Context, user authorization was not checked if the group did not reference any parameter values. This allowed users to download non-sensitive parameters without proper authorization.",
    "Insufficient authorization checks for Controller Services and Parameter Providers: When creating a new Process Group that referenced existing Controller Services or Parameter Providers, user authorization for these referenced components was not checked, enabling unauthorized users to use these components within the new group."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Authenticated users authorized to create Process Groups could bypass authorization checks, potentially downloading non-sensitive Parameter values and utilizing unauthorized Controller Services and Parameter Providers.",
  "Attack vectors": "Creating new Process Groups with references to Parameter Contexts, Controller Services, or Parameter Providers.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be an authenticated user with authorization to create Process Groups. The vulnerability is also limited to deployments with component-based authorization policies."
