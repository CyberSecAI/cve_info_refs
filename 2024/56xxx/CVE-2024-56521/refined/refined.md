Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-56521:

**Verification:**

The provided content includes commits related to TCPDF, specifically version 6.8.0, and the changes introduced in this version, one of which includes a fix related to cURL options. Although the CVE description is missing, this information points to a potential vulnerability related to the handling of URLs and cURL options, which are relevant to the security of the application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause appears to be the lack of flexibility in configuring cURL options when fetching remote resources, such as when using `fileGetContents` or checking if a URL exists. The previous implementation used hardcoded cURL options which might be insufficient for all use cases.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inflexible cURL configuration:** The previous hardcoded cURL options did not allow for customization, which could lead to issues when dealing with specific servers or configurations.
- **Potential for insecure defaults:** The hardcoded defaults may not have been the most secure in all cases.
- **Lack of control for users:** Users of the library had no control over cURL options, potentially hindering their ability to work around network issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** If an attacker can control the URL being fetched using `fileGetContents` or `url_exists`, they could potentially force the application to fetch resources from malicious servers which could lead to data exfiltration.
- **Denial of Service:** If an attacker can cause the application to access a very slow or unresponsive URL they can create a denial of service.
- **Bypassing security measures:** The hardcoded cURL settings may have bypassed security measures implemented at the system or network level.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would need to control, at least partially, the URLs that are passed to the functions `fileGetContents` or `url_exists`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to influence the input parameters to the aforementioned functions
- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely through various vectors including:
    - Maliciously crafted links in PDF documents,
    - SQL injection attacks that lead to fetching of malicious data,
    - User controlled input to TCPDF methods that accept URLs.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix introduced a `K_CURLOPTS` configuration array which allows users to specify custom cURL options.
- Default cURL options are now defined in the `CURLOPT_DEFAULT` constant, which can be overridden.
- The vulnerability was present in previous versions of TCPDF.
- The changes in this commit include:
    - Adding `K_CURLOPTS` to `tcpdf_autoconfig.php`
    - Adding `CURLOPT_DEFAULT` and `CURLOPT_FIXED` constants to `tcpdf_static.php`
    - Modifying `url_exists` and `fileGetContents` to make use of the new cURL configuration
