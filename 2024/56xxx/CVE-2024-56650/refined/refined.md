Based on the provided information, the content relates to **CVE-2024-56650**.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper validation of the LED ID string provided by userspace in the `led_tg_check()` function within the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem. Specifically, the code did not check if the provided ID was a valid null-terminated string before passing it to `kstrdup()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of a check to ensure that the LED ID string from userspace is a valid null-terminated string. This allows a user-provided string without a null terminator to be passed to the `kstrdup` function.
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** When `kstrdup` is called with a string that is not null-terminated, it relies on `strlen` which reads beyond the allocated memory causing a heap out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash:** The out-of-bounds read during `strlen` within `kstrdup` leads to a kernel crash due to a KASAN slab-out-of-bounds error.
- **Denial of Service:** A malicious user could trigger this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted netlink message with an invalid LED ID, leading to a system crash and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Netlink Message:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted netlink message that contains an LED trigger target with an invalid LED ID.
- **Userspace:** An attacker needs the ability to interact with the netfilter subsystem which is typically done by an unprivileged user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to send netlink messages.
- **Unprivileged user:** The attacker can be an unprivileged user.
