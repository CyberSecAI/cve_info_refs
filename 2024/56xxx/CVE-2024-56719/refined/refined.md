Based on the provided information, this content relates to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A previous commit (66600fac7a98) moved the assignment of `tx_skbuff_dma[]` members to be later in `stmmac_tso_xmit()`.
- The DMA API requires the dma cookie passed to `dma_unmap_single()` to be the same value returned by `dma_map_single()`.
- Moving the assignment of the DMA address, results in `dma_unmap_single()` being called with an incorrect DMA cookie (offset by `proto_hdr_len` when `priv->dma_cap.addr64 > 32`). The original DMA cookie was modified by an offset.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect DMA mapping and unmapping due to modified DMA cookie.
- Usage of an offset DMA cookie instead of the original one which is passed into `dma_unmap_single()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- DMA mapping failures can occur.
- The system can try to free DMA memory it has not allocated, leading to a kernel panic.
- The `dwc-eth-dwmac` driver will report errors like "Tx DMA map failed".

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) functionality in the `stmmac` driver with a network packet requiring segmentation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send network packets to a system using the affected `stmmac` Ethernet driver and having TSO enabled, where `priv->dma_cap.addr64 > 32`.
