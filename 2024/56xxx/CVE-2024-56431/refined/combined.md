/\*Instead of storing every branching in the tree, subtrees can be collapsed into one node, with a table of size 1<<nbits pointing directly to its descedents nbits levels down. This allows more than one bit to be read at a time, and avoids following all the intermediate branches with next to no increased code complexity once the collapsed tree has been built. We do \_not\_ require that a subtree be complete to be collapsed, but instead store duplicate pointers in the table, and record the actual depth of the node below its parent. This tells us the number of bits to advance the stream after reaching it.
 This turns out to be equivalent to the method described in \cite{Hash95}, without the requirement that codewords be sorted by length. If the codewords were sorted by length (so-called ``canonical-codes''), they could be decoded much faster via either Lindell and Moffat's approach or Hashemian's Condensed Huffman Code approach, the latter of which has an extremely small memory footprint. We can't use Choueka et al.'s finite state machine approach, which is extremely fast, because we can't allow multiple symbols to be output at a time; the codebook can and does change between symbols. It also has very large memory requirements, which impairs cache coherency.
 We store the tree packed in an array of 16-bit integers (words). Each node consists of a single word, followed consecutively by two or more indices of its children. Let n be the value of this first word. This is the number of bits that need to be read to traverse the node, and must be positive. 1<<n entries follow in the array, each an index to a child node. If the child is positive, then it is the index of another internal node in the table. If the child is negative or zero, then it is a leaf node. These are stored directly in the child pointer to save space, since they only require a single word. If a leaf node would have been encountered before reading n bits, then it is duplicated the necessary number of times in this table. Leaf nodes pack both a token value and their actual depth in the tree. The token in the leaf node is (-leaf&255). The number of bits that need to be consumed to reach the leaf, starting from the current node, is (-leaf>>8).

/\*The map from external spec-defined tokens to internal tokens. This is constructed so that any extra bits read with the original token value can be masked off the least significant bits of its internal token index. In addition, all of the tokens which require additional extra bits are placed at the start of the list, and grouped by type. OC\_DCT\_REPEAT\_RUN3\_TOKEN is placed first, as it is an extra-special case, so giving it index 0 may simplify comparisons on some architectures. These requirements require some substantial reordering.\*/static const unsigned char OC\_DCT\_TOKEN\_MAP[TH\_NDCT\_TOKENS]={ /\*OC\_DCT\_EOB1\_TOKEN (0 extra bits)\*/ 15, /\*OC\_DCT\_EOB2\_TOKEN (0 extra bits)\*/ 16, /\*OC\_DCT\_EOB3\_TOKEN (0 extra bits)\*/ 17, /\*OC\_DCT\_REPEAT\_RUN0\_TOKEN (2 extra bits)\*/ 88, /\*OC\_DCT\_REPEAT\_RUN1\_TOKEN (3 extra bits)\*/ 80, /\*OC\_DCT\_REPEAT\_RUN2\_TOKEN (4 extra bits)\*/ 1, /\*OC\_DCT\_REPEAT\_RUN3\_TOKEN (12 extra bits)\*/ 0, /\*OC\_DCT\_SHORT\_ZRL\_TOKEN (3 extra bits)\*/ 48, /\*OC\_DCT\_ZRL\_TOKEN (6 extra bits)\*/ 14, /\*OC\_ONE\_TOKEN (0 extra bits)\*/ 56, /\*OC\_MINUS\_ONE\_TOKEN (0 extra bits)\*/ 57, /\*OC\_TWO\_TOKEN (0 extra bits)\*/ 58, /\*OC\_MINUS\_TWO\_TOKEN (0 extra bits)\*/ 59, /\*OC\_DCT\_VAL\_CAT2 (1 extra bit)\*/ 60, 62, 64, 66, /\*OC\_DCT\_VAL\_CAT3 (2 extra bits)\*/ 68, /\*OC\_DCT\_VAL\_CAT4 (3 extra bits)\*/ 72, /\*OC\_DCT\_VAL\_CAT5 (4 extra bits)\*/ 2, /\*OC\_DCT\_VAL\_CAT6 (5 extra bits)\*/ 4, /\*OC\_DCT\_VAL\_CAT7 (6 extra bits)\*/ 6, /\*OC\_DCT\_VAL\_CAT8 (10 extra bits)\*/ 8, /\*OC\_DCT\_RUN\_CAT1A (1 extra bit)\*/ 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, /\*OC\_DCT\_RUN\_CAT1B (3 extra bits)\*/ 32, /\*OC\_DCT\_RUN\_CAT1C (4 extra bits)\*/ 12, /\*OC\_DCT\_RUN\_CAT2A (2 extra bits)\*/ 28, /\*OC\_DCT\_RUN\_CAT2B (3 extra bits)\*/ 40};

/\*The size a lookup table is allowed to grow to relative to the number of unique nodes it contains. E.g., if OC\_HUFF\_SLUSH is 4, then at most 75% of the space in the tree is wasted (1/4 of the space must be used). Larger numbers can decode tokens with fewer read operations, while smaller numbers may save more space. With a sample file: 32233473 read calls are required when no tree collapsing is done (100.0%). 19269269 read calls are required when OC\_HUFF\_SLUSH is 1 (59.8%). 11144969 read calls are required when OC\_HUFF\_SLUSH is 2 (34.6%). 10538563 read calls are required when OC\_HUFF\_SLUSH is 4 (32.7%). 10192578 read calls are required when OC\_HUFF\_SLUSH is 8 (31.6%). Since a value of 2 gets us the vast majority of the speed-up with only a small amount of wasted memory, this is what we use. This value must be less than 128, or you could create a tree with more than 32767 entries, which would overflow the 16-bit words used to index it.\*/#define OC\_HUFF\_SLUSH (2)/\*The root of the tree is on the fast path, and a larger value here is more beneficial than elsewhere in the tree. 7 appears to give the best performance, trading off between increased use of the single-read fast path and cache footprint for the tables, though obviously this will depend on your cache size.

| Some projects are removing Theora support for some reasons, including the fact the last official release was too many years ago, and also missing some important fixes (ome references below). Linux distros also needs to include many patches to build on recent environments: <https://salsa.debian.org/multimedia-team/libtheora/-/tree/master/debian/patches>  Is there a plan to have a new release with the accumulated fixes? A new release with the [Ptalarbvorm](https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/theora/demo9.html) would be even better. 💯   ---   DaemonEngine: [DaemonEngine/Daemon#391](https://github.com/DaemonEngine/Daemon/pull/391)  I noticed the Theora project seems kind of dead. When compiling, I saw a gcc warning that the decoder code indexes out of bounds. Although this was [fixed in 2012](https://github.com/xiph/theora/commit/0ae66d565e6bead8604d312bc1a4e9dccf245c88), there hasn't been a new release since 2010 so we didn't have the fix.  Google Chrome: <https://chromestatus.com/feature/5158654475239424>  The Theora video codec was first released in 2004 and had its last official release in 2011.  Mozilla Firefox: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1860492> |

| VP8 only supports 4:2:0, while Theora also supports 4:2:2 and 4:4:4. Although both VP9 and AV1 support all three ratios and HDR, there is [legal uncertainty](https://www.sisvel.com/licensing-programmes/audio-and-video-coding-decoding/) surrounding their royalty-free statuses. Therefore, I personally think that there should be security updates for Theora at least until H.264 becomes a free format in 5 years at most (I think). By then, I think higher resolution displays would become more ubiquitous, in which the improvements of 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 over 4:2:0 would become less noticeable. |

| I was hoping there would be a new, stable 1.2 release. It looks like Xiph is prioritizing Opus, FLAC, and rav1e right now; and they were working on Dalaa for a while before AV1 became a thing.  From what I've read, the reason why some projects are dropping Theora is because of lack of development, which caused worry in the wake of the WebP vulnerability (there is no security vulnerability in Theora that we know of, but some projects don't want to take chances on something that hasn't been updated in over ten years), and because there is little usage of Theora today. That's a shame too, because Theora is historically significant, is the only reliably free video format without looming patent claims, and as [@jpsaikali](https://github.com/jpsaikali) mentioned, it has features not found in VP8. I hate to see Theora appear so unloved.  Is there anyone at Xiph who can make an update to Theora happen? |

| I can ship a new release if desired. The current 1.2 encoder does have some quality regressions but also improvements, but likely the compilation fixes are more important than those.  If someone would like to become (co)-maintainer, and preferably has some history in open source projects, let us know in #theora or #xiph on libera.chat! |

| [@tdaede](https://github.com/tdaede) I agree. For right now, getting the compilation fixes in there would be nice, just so those continuing to use Theora (Pale Moon, VLC...) still have something, and we can say Theora isn't "dead."  As for version 1.2, I found an old to-do list of things desired for it:   * (done) Activity masking (greatly improved perceptual quality) * (done) Rename speedlevel 2 to 3 and provide a new speedlevel 2 * (done) ARM4/6/7/Neon assembly support * (done) C64x+ support * Fix SAD-for-SATD in intra analysis from Ralph's speed level patch. * Testing testing testing * Decoder speedups (improvements to ARM/c64x platform support) * Encoder speedups (additional short-cutting in fast modes) * Temporal RDO * Quantizer matrix improvements (Shift the range up to make higher rates achievable) * Mode selection improvements (split 3qi roles?) * Codebook re-optimization (Greg has code for this; waiting for other changes to settle) * Review open tickets * Review patches from the major distros   I'm not sure know who "Greg" and "Ralph" are, but we can worry about this at a later date.  I don't feel comfortable being co-maintainer at this time (not as much history contributing to open source projects, although I've been a big advocate for them since 2014 or so; and I haven't had my GitHub account long). I'd rather build up a reputation first. Can't take too many chances since [the XZ incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor),  Having said that, I just made a fork, and I can contribute with pull requests where I can!  Also, sorry about the late reply. |
