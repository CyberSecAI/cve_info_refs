In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/9p/usbg: fix handling of the failed kzalloc() memory allocation

On the linux-next, next-20241108 vanilla kernel, the coccinelle tool gave the
following error report:

./net/9p/trans_usbg.c:912:5-11: ERROR: allocation function on line 911 returns
NULL not ERR_PTR on failure

kzalloc() failure is fixed to handle the NULL return case on the memory exhaustion.
