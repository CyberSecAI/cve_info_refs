The provided content is related to CVE-2024-56609.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of TX skb (socket buffer) purging in the `rtw88` WiFi driver when kernel modules are removed. The driver used `skb_queue_purge()` which does not report the TX status, leading to a "Have pending ack frames!" warning and potential issues with the `mac80211` subsystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect TX queue purging: The driver was using `skb_queue_purge()` instead of `ieee80211_purge_tx_queue()`.
- Race condition: The `ieee80211_purge_tx_queue()` function doesn't use locks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Kernel warning: The primary impact observed is a warning message ("Have pending ack frames!") during module removal.
- Potential instability: While not explicitly stated, incorrect handling of TX buffers could lead to other issues within the `mac80211` subsystem.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Module removal: The vulnerability is triggered when the `rtw88` driver modules are unloaded using `rmmod`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to unload kernel modules. This typically requires root or administrative privileges.

**Technical Details:**
- The fix involves replacing `skb_queue_purge()` with `ieee80211_purge_tx_queue()` in both `rtw88_sdio` and `rtw88_usb` drivers.
- To prevent race conditions between TX work and the purge operation, TX work is flushed and destroyed before purging the queue.

The commit logs and diffs show the following changes:
- In `drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtw88/sdio.c`:
  -  `skb_queue_purge(&rtwsdio->tx_queue[i]);` is replaced with `ieee80211_purge_tx_queue(rtwdev->hw, &rtwsdio->tx_queue[i]);`
- In `drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtw88/usb.c`:
  - `skb_queue_purge(&rtwusb->tx_queue[i]);` is replaced with `ieee80211_purge_tx_queue(rtwdev->hw, &rtwusb->tx_queue[i]);`
  - Additionally, in `rtw_usb_deinit_tx`, `flush_workqueue(rtwusb->txwq); destroy_workqueue(rtwusb->txwq);` were removed and moved before the queue purging in another function.
