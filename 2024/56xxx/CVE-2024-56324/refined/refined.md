  "cve": "CVE-2024-56324",
  "relevant_content": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper handling of XML input by the GoCD server when a group admin edits the raw XML configuration for groups they administer. This lack of proper sanitization allows for XML External Entity (XXE) injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability (CWE-611)"
    ],
    "impact": "Theoretically, the XXE vulnerability can lead to additional attacks, such as SSRF, information disclosure from the GoCD server, and directory traversal. However, these additional attacks have not been explicitly demonstrated as exploitable.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a GoCD group admin. They also need the ability to edit the raw XML configuration for groups they administer."
