# Denial of Service (DoS) with Server Actions

Moderate

[ztanner](/ztanner)
published
GHSA-7m27-7ghc-44w9
Jan 3, 2025

## Package

npm

next
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 13.0.0 < 14.2.21, >= 15.0.0 < 15.1.1

## Patched versions

15.1.2, 14.2.21, 13.5.8

## Description

### Impact

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack allows attackers to construct requests that leaves requests to Server Actions hanging until the hosting provider cancels the function execution.

*Note: Next.js server is idle during that time and only keeps the connection open. CPU and memory footprint are low during that time.*

Deployments without any protection against long running Server Action invocations are especially vulnerable. Hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify set a default maximum duration on function execution to reduce the risk of excessive billing.

This is the same issue as if the incoming HTTP request has an invalid `Content-Length` header or never closes. If the host has no other mitigations to those then this vulnerability is novel.

This vulnerability affects only Next.js deployments using Server Actions.

### Patches

This vulnerability was resolved in Next.js 14.2.21, 15.1.2, and 13.5.8. We recommend that users upgrade to a safe version.

### Workarounds

There are no official workarounds for this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
