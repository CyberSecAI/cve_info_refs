- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the way Next.js handles requests to Server Actions. Attackers can craft requests that cause the server to keep the connection open without processing the request, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This is similar to an HTTP request with an invalid `Content-Length` header or one that never closes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of protection against long-running Server Action invocations. The server keeps the connection open without completing the action, which can exhaust server resources over time.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack results in a denial of service (DoS). The server will become unresponsive as resources are tied up by the hung requests. While the server does not consume much CPU or memory during this time, the open connection prevents it from handling legitimate requests, effectively making the application unavailable. Hosting providers might terminate the function execution to prevent excessive billing.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. Attackers can exploit this by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to trigger the hanging Server Action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers do not need any special privileges or user interaction. They simply need to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server.
