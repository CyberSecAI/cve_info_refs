The provided content is related to CVE-2024-56362.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Navidrome application stores the JWT secret in plaintext within the `navidrome.db` database file under the `property` table.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Plaintext storage of the JWT secret.
- Lack of encryption for sensitive data at rest.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to the database file can retrieve the JWT secret.
- With the exposed secret, attackers can forge valid tokens to impersonate users, including administrative accounts.
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Ability to perform privileged actions.

**Attack vectors:**
Local access to the `navidrome.db` database file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs low level privileges and local access to the machine where Navidrome is installed and access to the `navidrome.db` file.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability has been tested on the latest version of Navidrome and poses a significant risk in environments where the database file is not adequately secured.
- The vulnerability is tracked as GHSA-xwx7-p63r-2rj8.
- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information).
- Affected versions are <=0.53.3
- This vulnerability has been fixed in later versions by encrypting the JWT secret. The commits provided show the changes made to implement encryption of the JWT secret.
