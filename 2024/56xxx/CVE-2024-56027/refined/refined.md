- An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require authentication
- The attacker needs to inject their malicious script into the vulnerable part of the plugin

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.1, which is rated as medium severity.
