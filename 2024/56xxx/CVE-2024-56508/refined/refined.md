**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **File Upload Vulnerability:**  The application allows the upload of HTML files without proper content inspection and sanitization.

- **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to steal sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted HTML file containing malicious JavaScript.
