- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Interactive UK Map plugin for WordPress versions 3.4.8 and below is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. The specific impact can vary.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via a malicious link or website that coerces an authenticated user into unintentionally performing actions on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick an authenticated user of the vulnerable WordPress site into triggering the request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated themselves.
