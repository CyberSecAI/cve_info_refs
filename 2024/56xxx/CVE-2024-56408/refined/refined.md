The content is related to CVE-2024-56408.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of sanitization of the `quantity` parameter in the `/vendor/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/samples/Engineering/Convert-Online.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The `Convert-Online.php` script does not sanitize user-provided input, specifically the `quantity` parameter, before displaying it in the HTML output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can craft a malicious HTML form that sends a POST request to the vulnerable `Convert-Online.php` script with a payload in the `quantity` parameter.
- When a victim visits the attacker's webpage, the malicious form is automatically submitted, triggering the XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a web page that can be accessed by a victim user.
- The attacker doesn't require any prior privileges or authentication on the target server.
- User interaction is required, in the form of visiting the attacker-controlled webpage.
