**Root Cause:** The Contact Form 7 Dynamic Text Extension plugin for WordPress versions 5.0.1 and earlier is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CSRF:** The plugin lacks proper protection against CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker to potentially force a logged-in user to execute unwanted actions on the website.

*   A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to perform actions that the attacker chooses. This can lead to various outcomes depending on the plugin's functionalities and the permissions of the targeted user, ranging from modifying plugin settings to potentially gaining more control over the website, however the specific impact varies from case to case.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **CSRF:** Attackers would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a website with a crafted request, thereby making the user unknowingly perform actions on the vulnerable website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick or force a logged-in user of the vulnerable website to trigger a crafted HTTP request to the affected site. The attacker does not need any account or authentication on the target WordPress site itself.
