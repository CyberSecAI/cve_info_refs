  "cveId": "CVE-2024-56722",
  "related": true,
  "cveData": {
    "summary": "The provided code changes address a potential CPU stall issue in the RDMA/hns driver during reset operations. The root cause is excessive logging when destroying resources, which can lead to a CPU lockup, especially when numerous resources are being released.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "rootCause": "Excessive logging during resource destruction.",
        "weakness": "Uncontrolled or excessive printing of error messages.",
         "impact": "CPU stall or lockup.",
        "attackVector": "Triggering a device reset that leads to the destruction of many RDMA resources (QP, CQ, MR, SRQ).",
        "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to cause a reset of the RDMA device in such a way that a large number of resources have to be cleaned up."
      }
    ],
      "mitigation": "The vulnerability is addressed by replacing direct printing functions with their rate-limited counterparts or removing unnecessary print statements. This prevents the CPU from being overwhelmed by logs during reset operations."
