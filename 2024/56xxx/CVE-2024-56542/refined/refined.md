{
  "CVE-2024-56542": {
    "related": true,
    "description": "A memory leak issue occurs in the amdgpu display driver when the driver is removed and reloaded. The first removal frees allocated memory, but on subsequent reloads, the VBIOS DMUB is not active due to PSP policy retaining the loaded driver version, which causes communication with the VBIOS DMUB to fail. This leads to a memory leak.",
    "root_cause": "The memory leak stems from the failure to properly free memory allocated for the DMUB bounding box when the amdgpu driver is removed and reloaded. On subsequent reloads, VBIOS DMUB is not active, leading to communication failures and preventing the release of allocated memory.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory Leak"
    ],
     "impact": "The memory leak can lead to resource exhaustion if the driver is repeatedly loaded and unloaded without proper memory deallocation.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the amdgpu driver is loaded and then unloaded. Subsequently, if the driver is loaded again, the memory leak can occur.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to load and unload the amdgpu kernel module (typically requiring root or administrator privileges)."
