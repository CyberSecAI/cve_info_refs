## Description

![@BoB13-Matter](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181179481?v=4&size=48)[BoB13-Matter](https://github.com/BoB13-Matter)opened [on Dec 6, 2024](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/issues/36750#issue-2723299806)
### Reproduction steps

1. Run `chip-all-clusters-app`.
2. Configure the following parameters in `poc.py`:

   [poc.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18039301/poc.txt)

   * `target_ip` and `target_port`: The IP and port of the `chip-all-clusters-app` instance.
   * `interface`: The name of your local network interface.
3. Execute `poc.py` with the command: `sudo python3 poc.py`.
4. Observe that the `chip-all-clusters-app` crashes, producing the following crash log:

   [crash\_log.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18039313/crash_log.txt)

### Summary

A vulnerability in the TCP-based Matter packet handling allows an unauthenticated attacker to trigger a crash by sending a single malformed packet. The issue stems from improper management of packet during message parsing, leading to a null pointer dereference. This affects all Matter implementations that rely on the TCP packet handling logic and can result in a complete Denial of Service (DoS).

### Description and Analysis

1. **Parsing the Packet Length**

   TCP-based Matter packets encode the payload length in the first 4 bytes. In the `TCPBase::ProcessReceivedBuffer` function, this length is read using the `Read()` method and stored in the `messageSize` variable.

   ```
   CHIP_ERROR TCPBase::ProcessReceivedBuffer(Inet::TCPEndPoint * endPoint, const PeerAddress & peerAddress,
                                             System::PacketBufferHandle && buffer)
   {
       ActiveTCPConnectionState * state = FindActiveConnection(endPoint);
       VerifyOrReturnError(state != nullptr, CHIP_ERROR_INTERNAL);
       state->mReceived.AddToEnd(std::move(buffer));

       while (!state->mReceived.IsNull())
       {
           uint8_t messageSizeBuf[kPacketSizeBytes];
           CHIP_ERROR err = state->mReceived->Read(messageSizeBuf);
           if (err == CHIP_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL)
           {
               // Not enough data to read the message size. Wait for more data.
               return CHIP_NO_ERROR;
           }
           if (err != CHIP_NO_ERROR)
           {
               return err;
           }
           uint32_t messageSize = LittleEndian::Get32(messageSizeBuf);
   ```
2. **Consuming Length Bytes**

   Before the `ProcessSingleMessage` function is invoked, the 4-byte length field is consumed using the `Consume()` method.

   ```
       state->mReceived.Consume(kPacketSizeBytes); // kPacketSizeBytes == 4
       ReturnErrorOnFailure(ProcessSingleMessage(peerAddress, state, messageSize));
   ```

   ```
   void Consume(size_t aConsumeLength) { mBuffer = mBuffer->Consume(aConsumeLength); }
   ```
3. **Invoke FreeHead Function**

   If the length to consume (`aConsumeLength`) exceeds or equals the remaining buffer length (`kLength`), the `FreeHead()` function is invoked.

   ```
   PacketBuffer * PacketBuffer::Consume(size_t aConsumeLength)
   {
       PacketBuffer * lPacket = this;

       while (lPacket != nullptr && aConsumeLength > 0)
       {
           const size_t kLength = lPacket->DataLength();

           if (aConsumeLength >= kLength) // 4 >= 4
           {
               lPacket        = PacketBuffer::FreeHead(lPacket);
               aConsumeLength = aConsumeLength - kLength;
           }
           else
           {
               lPacket->ConsumeHead(aConsumeLength);
               break;
           }
       }

       return lPacket;
   }
   ```
4. **Return nullptr**

   When `ChainedBuffer` is not present, `lNextPacket` becomes `nullptr`. This value is returned, causing `state->mReceived`'s `mBuffer` to become `nullptr`.

   ```
   PacketBuffer * PacketBuffer::FreeHead(PacketBuffer * aPacket)
   {
       PacketBuffer * lNextPacket = aPacket->ChainedBuffer(); // lNextPacket = nullptr
       aPacket->next              = nullptr;
       PacketBuffer::Free(aPacket);
       return lNextPacket; // return nullptr
   }
   ```
5. **Crash via Null Pointer Dereference**

   When `ProcessSingleMessage` is executed, `state->mReceived` is `nullptr`, leading to a null pointer dereference and a crash.

   ```
   CHIP_ERROR TCPBase::ProcessSingleMessage(const PeerAddress & peerAddress, ActiveTCPConnectionState * state, size_t messageSize)
   {
       // ...
       if (state->mReceived->DataLength() == messageSize) // Crash: null pointer dereference
       {
   ```

   **Debug Output:**

   ```
   pwndbg> p state->mReceived
   $5 = {
       mBuffer = 0x0
   }
   ```

### Proposed Solution

To prevent this issue, a null pointer check should be added for `state->mReceived` before invoking `ProcessSingleMessage`. This ensures the function is not called when `state->mReceived` is `nullptr`.

```
    state->mReceived.Consume(kPacketSizeBytes);
    VerifyOrReturnError(!state->mReceived.IsNull(), CHIP_ERROR_MESSAGE_INCOMPLETE); // Add null pointer verification
    ReturnErrorOnFailure(ProcessSingleMessage(peerAddress, state, messageSize));
```

### @BoB13-Matter **[BoB13-Matter](/BoB13-Matter)** commented [Dec 6, 2024](#issue-2723311560) • edited Loading

**Description**

This PR fixes [#36750](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/issues/36750) a null pointer dereference in `TCPBase::ProcessSingleMessage` caused by malformed TCP packets. The issue could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

**Changes**

* Added a null pointer validation for `state->mReceived` before calling `ProcessSingleMessage`.
* This change prevents crash and print error log:

  ```
  [1733488993.071785][31090:31090] CHIP:IN: Incoming connection established with peer at fe80::46c0:aa19:6d9:c653.
  [1733488993.071895][31090:31090] CHIP:IN: Received TCP connection request from TCP:[fe80::46c0:aa19:6d9:c653%ens33]:42740.
  [1733488993.072182][31090:31090] CHIP:IN: Failed to accept received TCP message: src/transport/raw/TCP.cpp:347: CHIP Error 0x0000000D: Message incomplete
  [1733488993.072304][31090:31090] CHIP:IN: Closing connection with peer TCP:[fe80::46c0:aa19:6d9:c653%ens33]:42740.
  ```

**Testing**

* Tested against malformed packets to confirm the fix.
* Verified with valid packet. (e.g. `onoff on 1 1 --allow-large-payload 1`)

Sorry, something went wrong.

The `Testing` section here seems to contain a "manual" entry. Please add more details (how does one test with "malformed packets" to reproduce the test) and add a justification why automated testing of this code is impossible.

We are intentionally trying to make the "manually tested" threshold high to avoid PRs being marked as "manually tested" because it is easier to do so.

Since this is a "Processed buffer" call, it does seem that this could be unit tested.

Sorry, something went wrong.

We are intentionally trying to make the "manually tested" threshold high to avoid PRs being marked as "manually tested" because it is easier to do so.  Since this is a "Processed buffer" call, it does seem that this could be unit tested.  Thanks. I have added a new test in TestTCP.cpp to validate the behavior with malformed packets. Let me know if further modifications are needed. |
