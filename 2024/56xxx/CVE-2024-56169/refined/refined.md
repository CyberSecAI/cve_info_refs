{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from Fort using its cache primarily as a bandwidth-saving tool instead of a reliable fallback. It does not properly utilize the backup cache of remote RPKI data as a fallback when a new fetch fails or yields incorrect files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient fallback mechanism when fetching RPKI data."
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact is incomplete Route Origin Validation data, leading to potentially incorrect routing decisions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious or malfunctioning RPKI repository can cause a fetch failure or provide incorrect files.",
      "A network issue during the fetch process could also trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to control or manipulate an RPKI repository to serve incorrect or incomplete data, causing a fetch failure in Fort."
  }
