## Description

A validation integrity issue was discovered in Fort through 1.6.4 before 2.0.0. RPKI Relying Parties (such as Fort) are supposed to maintain a backup cache of the remote RPKI data. This can be employed as a fallback in case a new fetch fails or yields incorrect files. However, the product currently uses its cache merely as a bandwidth saving tool (because fetching is performed through deltas). If a fetch fails midway or yields incorrect files, there is no viable fallback. This leads to incomplete route origin validation data.

| [Mistake](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/commit/aaae3c484a82075ef1e3186c511cc34e9e31ea1a#diff-18a94ea3e331a8634fe3fd18bef5b238f8a8d72d517226aebde53021fa25ac29).  FORT is not 100% [RFC 6486](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6486) compliant. Having a certain degree of tolerance to missing, invalid or stale manifests involves a significantly more elaborate framework than a flag that globally allows dates to mismatch.  If a correct manifest becomes an invalid manifest an iteration later, the RP is supposed to attempt to fall back to the old manifest. Sample 6486 quote:  In the case where the RP has access to a local cache of previously issued (valid) manifests, an RP MAY make use of that locally cached data. Specifically, the RP MAY use the locally cached, most recent, previously issued, valid manifest issued by the entity that (appears to have) issued the invalid manifest.  Though it's spelled as a MAY, the reality is that not falling back to old versions prunes entire branches off the repository, which can lead to catastrophic ROA deficits.  Please note: [6486-bis](https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-sidrops-6486bis-09.html) already exists, so that's going to need attention too.  Thanks to Ties de Kock for reporting this. |

- `cache/rsync`, `cache/https` and `cache/rrdp` contain \"refreshes\"
  (the exact latest files according to the servers). RRDP withdraws are
  honored, and rsyncs run without --compare-dest.
- \"Refresh\" files marked as valid are backed up in `cache/fallback`
  at the end of each validation cycle.
- Validation first tests fallback+refresh. (If a file exists in both,
  refresh wins.) If that fails, it retries with fallback only.
- The index is not a tree; everything is caged in numbered directories
  and indexed by exact URL, to prevent file overriding by URL hacking.

There's also a `cache/tmp` directory, where Fort temporarily dumps
notifications, snapshots and deltas. This directory will be removed
once #127 is fixed.")`

```

- `cache/rsync`, `cache/https` and `cache/rrdp` contain "refreshes"
  (the exact latest files according to the servers). RRDP withdraws are
  honored, and rsyncs run without --compare-dest.
- "Refresh" files marked as valid are backed up in `cache/fallback`
  at the end of each validation cycle.
- Validation first tests fallback+refresh. (If a file exists in both,
  refresh wins.) If that fails, it retries with fallback only.
- The index is not a tree; everything is caged in numbered directories
  and indexed by exact URL, to prevent file overriding by URL hacking.

There's also a `cache/tmp` directory, where Fort temporarily dumps
notifications, snapshots and deltas. This directory will be removed
once [#127](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/issues/127) is fixed.

## CVE-2024-45238

Certificate containing a malformed `subjectPublicKey` crashes Fort 1.6.2-, when compiled with OpenSSL < 3.

| Description | A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a resource certificate containing a bit string that doesn’t properly decode into a Subject Public Key. OpenSSL does [not report this problem during parsing](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/OpenSSL_1_1_1w/crypto/x509/x_pubkey.c#L152-L157), and when compiled with OpenSSL libcrypto versions below 3, Fort was recklessly dereferencing the pointer. |
| --- | --- |
| Impact | Crash. (Potential unavailability of Route Origin Validation.) |
| Patch | Commit [5689dea](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/commit/5689dea5e878fed28c5f338a27d7cda4151a14f1), released in Fort 1.6.3. |
| Acknowledgments | Thanks to Niklas Vogel and Haya Schulmann for their research and disclosure. |

## CVE-2024-45237

Certificate containing a Key Usage bit string longer than 2 bytes causes buffer overflow on Fort 1.6.2-.

| Description | A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a resource certificate containing a [Key Usage extension](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.3) consisting of more than two bytes of data. Fort used to write this string on a 2-byte buffer without properly sanitizing its length, leading to buffer overflow. |
| --- | --- |
| Impact | Depending on compilation options, the vulnerability would lead to a crash (which might in turn lead to unavailability of Route Origin Validation), incorrect validation results or arbitrary code execution. |
| Patch | Commit [939d988](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/commit/939d988551d17996be73f52c376a70a3d6ba69f9), released in Fort 1.6.3. |
| Acknowledgments | Thanks to Niklas Vogel and Haya Schulmann for their research and disclosure. |

## CVE-2024-45235

Certificate containing an Authority Key Identifier missing a `keyIdentifier` crashes Fort 1.6.2-.

| Description | A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a resource certificate containing an [Authority Key Identifier extension](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.1) missing the `keyIdentifier` field. Fort was referencing the pointer without sanitizing it first. |
| --- | --- |
| Impact | Crash. (Potential unavailability of Route Origin Validation.) |
| Patch | Commit [b1eb3c5](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/commit/b1eb3c507ae920859bbe294776ebc2bb30bb7e56), released in Fort 1.6.3. |
| Acknowledgments | Thanks to Niklas Vogel and Haya Schulmann for their research and disclosure. |

## CVE-2024-45236

Signed Object containing empty `signedAttrs` crashes Fort 1.6.2-.

| Description | A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a signed object containing an empty [`signedAttributes`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6488#section-2.1.6.4). Fort was accessing the set’s elements without sanitizing it first. |
| --- | --- |
| Impact | Crash. (Potential unavailability of Route Origin Validation.) |
| Patch | Commit [4dafbd9](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/commit/4dafbd9de64a5a0616af97365bc1751465b29d2e), released in Fort 1.6.3. |
| Acknowledgments | Thanks to Niklas Vogel and Haya Schulmann for their research and disclosure. |

## CVE-2024-45239

Signed Object containing null `eContent` crashes Fort 1.6.2-.

| Description | A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a ROA or Manifest containing a null [`eContent`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6488#section-2.1.3.2). Fort was dereferencing the pointer without sanitizing it first. |
| --- | --- |
| Impact | Crash. (Potential unavailability of Route Origin Validation.) |
| Patch | Commit [942f921](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/commit/942f921ba7244cdcf4574cedc4c16392a7cc594b), released in Fort 1.6.3. |
| Acknowledgments | Thanks to Niklas Vogel and Haya Schulmann for their research and disclosure. |

## CVE-2024-45234

Certificate containing `signedAttrs` not in canonical form crashes Fort 1.6.2-.

| Description | A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a ROA or Manifest containing a `signedAttrs` encoded in non-canonical form. This bypassed the BER-decoder, reaching a point in the code that panicked when faced with data not encoded in DER. |
| --- | --- |
| Impact | Crash. (Potential unavailability of Route Origin Validation.) |
| Patch | Commit [521b1a0](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/commit/521b1a0db5041258096fbabdf8fc1e10ecc793cf), released in Fort 1.6.3. |
| Acknowledgments | Thanks to Niklas Vogel and Haya Schulmann for their research and disclosure. |

## CVE-2024-48943

Malicious rsync repositories can block Fort by drip-feeding repository objects.

| Description | A malicious RPKI rsync repository can prevent Fort from finishing its validation run by drip-feeding its content. |
| --- | --- |
| Impact | Delayed validation. (Stale or unavailable Route Origin Validation.) |
| Patch | Commit [4ee88d1](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/commit/4ee88d1c3fa7df763dd52312134cd93c1ce50870), released in Fort 1.6.4. |
| Acknowledgments | Thanks to Koen van Hove for his research and disclosure, and Job Snijders for the proposed fix. |

## CVE-2024-56170

Fort is employing the latest fetched manifest, rather than the one with the most recent metadata.

| Description | RPKI manifests are listings of relevant files that clients are supposed to verify.Assuming everything else is correct, the most recent version of a manifest should be prioritized over other versions, to prevent replays, accidental or otherwise.Manifests contain the `manifestNumber` and `thisUpdate` fields, which can be used to gauge the relevance of a given manifest, when compared to other manifests. The former is a serial-like sequential number, and the latter is the date in which the manifest was created.Fort is not comparing the up-to-dateness of the most recently-fetched manifest against the cached manifest. As such, it’s prone to roll back into a previous version if it’s served a valid outdated manifest. |
| --- | --- |
| Impact | Outdated Route Origin Validation. |
| Patch | Scheduled for Fort release [2.0.0](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/milestone/12). |
| Acknowledgments | Job Snijders |

## CVE-2024-56169

Fort’s cache provides insufficient fallbacking.

| Description | RPKI Relying Parties (such as Fort) are supposed to maintain a backup cache of the remote RPKI data. This can be employed as fallback in case a new fetch fails or yields incorrect files.Fort is presently using its cache merely as a bandwidth saving tool. (Because the fetching is performed through deltas.) If a fetch fails midway or yields incorrect files, Fort is left without a viable fallback. |
| --- | --- |
| Impact | Incomplete Route Origin Validation data. |
| Patch | Scheduled for Fort release [2.0.0](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/milestone/12). |
| Acknowledgments | Ties de Kock |

## CVE-2024-56375

Manifest containing empty `fileList` crashes Fort 1.6.3, 1.6.4.

| Description | A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) a Manifest RPKI object containing an empty fileList.Fort dereferences (and shortly afterwards writes) this array during a shuffle attempt, before the validation that would normally reject it when empty.This out-of-bounds access is caused by an integer underflow that causes the surrounding loop to iterate infinitely. As Fort gets stuck permanently attempting to overshuffle an array that doesn’t actually exist, a crash is pretty much guaranteed. |
| --- | --- |
| Impact | Crash. (Potential unavailability of Route Origin Validation.) |
| Patch | Commit [17f0952](https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/commit/17f095210553182b0e0a28ee6fd41b0d3c8fc1d3), released in Fort 1.6.5. |

## Description

A validation integrity issue was discovered in Fort through 1.6.4 before 2.0.0. RPKI manifests are listings of relevant files that clients are supposed to verify. Assuming everything else is correct, the most recent version of a manifest should be prioritized over other versions, to prevent replays, accidental or otherwise. Manifests contain the manifestNumber and thisUpdate fields, which can be used to gauge the relevance of a given manifest, when compared to other manifests. The former is a serial-like sequential number, and the latter is the date on which the manifest was created. However, the product does not compare the up-to-dateness of the most recently fetched manifest against the cached manifest. As such, it's prone to a rollback to a previous version if it's served a valid outdated manifest. This leads to outdated route origin validation.
