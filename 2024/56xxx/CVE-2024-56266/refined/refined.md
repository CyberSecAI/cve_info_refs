- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function, which allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher-privileged action. This is categorized as a Broken Access Control issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized access to certain functionalities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user (Subscriber) can perform actions that should be restricted to higher-level users. The specific impact will vary depending on the nature of the privileged action, but it could potentially allow for unauthorized modification of data or functionalities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting the missing access control checks within the plugin's code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a user account with the "Subscriber" role, which is the lowest privilege role in WordPress.
