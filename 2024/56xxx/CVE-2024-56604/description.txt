In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: RFCOMM: avoid leaving dangling sk pointer in rfcomm_sock_alloc()

bt_sock_alloc() attaches allocated sk object to the provided sock object.
If rfcomm_dlc_alloc() fails, we release the sk object, but leave the
dangling pointer in the sock object, which may cause use-after-free.

Fix this by swapping calls to bt_sock_alloc() and rfcomm_dlc_alloc().
