(core) Fix attachment and hyperlink vulnerabilities

Summary:
Attachments were prone to XSS-based attacks if attachments injected with scripts
were previewed or opened. This is now addressed by CSP.

Hyperlink cells were prone to similar attacks if `javascript:...` URLs were inserted into
cells. This has also been addressed by sanitizing URLs.

# XSS vulnerability through HyperLink cells

High

[paulfitz](/paulfitz)
published
GHSA-qv69-5cj2-53r9
Dec 20, 2024

## Package

docker

gristlabs/grist
([docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

< 1.3.2

## Patched versions

1.3.2

## Description

### Impact

A user visiting a malicious document and clicking on a link in a HyperLink cell using a control modifier (meaning for example Ctrl+click) could have their account compromised, since the link could use the javascript: scheme and be evaluated in the context of their current page.

### Patches

Fixed since version 1.3.2

Mitigation was to restrict HyperLink cell links to http(s) schemes.

### Workarounds

Avoid clicking on HyperLink cell links using a control modifier in documents prepared by people you do not trust.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
