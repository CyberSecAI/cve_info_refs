    "details": [
      {
        "type": "Root cause",
        "text": "The vulnerability stems from the abuse of a hidden/unused configuration repository feature (pipelines as code) in GoCD, which allows XML External Entity (XXE) injection."
      },
      {
        "type": "Weaknesses",
        "text": "The vulnerability is due to an XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability within the GoCD Server related to the processing of XML configuration repositories."

      {
        "type": "Impact",
        "text": "An attacker with GoCD administrative privileges can perform XXE injection on the GoCD server. This can lead to low confidentiality impact, since the impact of XXE is limited for GoCD (super) admins as they have the ability to cause much larger damage."

        {
        "type": "Attack vectors",
        "text": "The attack vector is network-based. The vulnerability is triggered when GoCD scans configuration repositories for updates or when an admin triggers such scans."

      {
        "type": "Required attacker capabilities",
        "text": "The attacker needs high privileges, specifically being a GoCD (super) admin to abuse this vulnerability. No user interaction is required."
