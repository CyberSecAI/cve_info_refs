- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to CSRF, allowing an attacker to potentially execute unauthorized actions on behalf of a victim user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack allows a remote attacker to create an administrator account in Amiro.CMS.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker exploits the CSRF vulnerability by tricking a logged-in user into performing unintended actions, such as clicking a malicious link or loading a crafted page, which in turn sends a request to the vulnerable application
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user of the Amiro.CMS into triggering a malicious request. The attacker does not require prior authentication but needs the victim to be logged into the application.
