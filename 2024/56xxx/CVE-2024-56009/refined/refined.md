- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin has a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that should require higher privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute privileged actions. The specific impact can vary on a case-by-case basis.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a request to the vulnerable function without the necessary authorization checks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
