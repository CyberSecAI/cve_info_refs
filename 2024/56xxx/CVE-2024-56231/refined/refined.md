Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The SaasPricing WordPress plugin, versions 1.1.4 and below, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin lacks proper input sanitization or output encoding, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A successful XSS attack could enable a malicious actor to inject arbitrary scripts (HTML, JavaScript) into the website. This can lead to various consequences, such as:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Displaying unwanted advertisements or content.
    *   Stealing user cookies or session information.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.
    *   Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's functionality, where user-supplied input is not properly handled, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts via a contributor role.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   * The attacker needs to be at least a contributor level user.
   * The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts through the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability has a low severity rating with a CVSS score of 6.5.
* There is no official fix available from the plugin developer.
