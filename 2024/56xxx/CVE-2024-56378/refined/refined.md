Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-56378

**Root Cause:**
- An out-of-bounds read occurs within the `JBIG2Bitmap::combine` function in `JBIG2Stream.cc`. This happens when processing a malformed JBIG2 image within a PDF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The `JBIG2Bitmap::combine` function attempts to read memory beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that, when processed by an application using the vulnerable Poppler library (e.g., `pdfimages` utility), will trigger a crash, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF File:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted PDF file containing malformed JBIG2 data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious PDF file to a user or system that utilizes the vulnerable Poppler library. This may be through email, websites, or other means of file delivery. The user would need to open or process the PDF file using an application that utilizes the vulnerable version of poppler library.

**Additional Details:**

- The crash occurs specifically within the `JBIG2Bitmap::combine` function during the processing of the JBIG2 image data stream.
- The provided crash log indicates the exact line of code and call stack leading to the out-of-bounds read.
- The vulnerability can be triggered using the `pdfimages` utility to extract images from the malicious PDF file.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) PDF file is provided as `poc.pdf`.
