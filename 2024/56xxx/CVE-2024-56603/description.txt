In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: af_can: do not leave a dangling sk pointer in can_create()

On error can_create() frees the allocated sk object, but sock_init_data()
has already attached it to the provided sock object. This will leave a
dangling sk pointer in the sock object and may cause use-after-free later.
