The provided content relates to CVE-2024-56625.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `gpiod_set_value()` in the `can_set_termination` function within the CAN (Controller Area Network) driver. This function is responsible for setting the termination state of the CAN bus using a GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pin. The original implementation used `gpiod_set_value()` which is not designed for use with sleeping GPIOs. If a CAN device uses a GPIO behind an I2C port expander, this can cause a warning and lead to unpredictable behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the usage of the wrong GPIO setting function. The `gpiod_set_value()` function doesn't allow for sleeping GPIOs, as opposed to `gpiod_set_value_cansleep()`, which is designed for use with sleeping GPIOs (i.e. GPIOs behind I2C port expanders).

**Impact of exploitation:**
The direct impact of this issue isn't a security vulnerability but rather instability, including kernel warnings and potential malfunctions. When a sleeping GPIO is used with `gpiod_set_value()`, the operation may fail or result in undefined behaviour, specifically a warning as shown in the content:  `WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 379 at /drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c:3496 gpiod_set_value+0x50/0x6c`. This can impact the CAN bus functionality which is commonly used in industrial and automotive applications.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when the `can_set_termination` function is called with a CAN device that utilizes a sleeping GPIO for termination control. This function is typically invoked by the operating system during CAN device setup or configuration. An attacker would need to have the ability to control the system's hardware and/or device tree configuration to exploit this.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to configure the CAN device to use a sleeping GPIO for termination. This usually requires root privileges or direct access to the system's hardware and device tree. They also need to be able to trigger the initialization/configuration of the CAN device by starting/using the CAN network interface.

**Summary of the fix:**
The fix replaces `gpiod_set_value()` with `gpiod_set_value_cansleep()` in the `can_set_termination` function within the `drivers/net/can/dev/dev.c` file. This ensures that sleeping GPIOs can be used correctly for CAN termination control, avoiding warnings and potential issues.
