- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Wayne Audio Player Plugin (<= 1.0) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions while they are authenticated on the site. Specific impacts may vary based on the actions that are possible to perform through the CSRF vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:**  A malicious actor could craft a CSRF attack and trick a logged-in user with higher privileges into submitting the request while they are authenticated, leading to unintended actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into submitting a forged request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
