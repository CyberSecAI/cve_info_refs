The provided content relates to CVE-2024-56539.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a field-spanning write detected by `memcpy` within the `mwifiex_config_scan` function of the Marvell mwifiex driver in the Linux kernel. This occurs when copying an SSID to the `wildcard_ssid_tlv->ssid` field. The struct `mwifiex_ie_types_wildcard_ssid_params` had a fixed size one-element array `u8 ssid[1]`, which was smaller than the actual SSID length being copied, resulting in out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write due to incorrect array sizing.
- Usage of `memcpy` with a destination buffer smaller than the source buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption.
- Potential system instability and unexpected behavior, due to the out-of-bounds write.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered during Wi-Fi scanning operations, specifically when the `mwifiex_config_scan` function uses the `memcpy` to copy the SSID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to trigger a Wi-Fi scan operation that involves the vulnerable code path. This typically means the attacker would need to be within Wi-Fi range of a vulnerable device, and initiate or interfere with the device scanning for networks.

The fix replaces `u8 ssid[1]` with a flexible-array member `u8 ssid[];` in the `mwifiex_ie_types_wildcard_ssid_params` struct, thus allowing `memcpy` to write correct number of bytes for SSID.
