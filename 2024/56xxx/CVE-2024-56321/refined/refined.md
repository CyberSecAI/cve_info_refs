  "CVE-2024-56321": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "GoCD versions 18.9.0 through 24.4.0 allow GoCD admins to abuse the backup configuration \"post-backup script\" feature to potentially execute arbitrary scripts on the hosting server or container as GoCD's user. This is fixed in GoCD 24.5.0. Post-backup scripts can no longer be executed from within certain sensitive locations on the GoCD server.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper validation of the location of the post-backup script, allowing execution of scripts from sensitive directories.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Inadequate validation of file paths.",
        "Unrestricted script execution."
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary script execution on the GoCD server, potentially leading to privilege escalation if the GoCD admin does not have host admin permissions.",
       "attack_vectors": [
            "Manipulation of the 'post-backup script' setting in GoCD's backup configuration.",
            "Execution of arbitrary scripts by the GoCD server using the configured path."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": [
           "Must be a GoCD administrator.",
           "Must be able to modify GoCD backup configuration."
