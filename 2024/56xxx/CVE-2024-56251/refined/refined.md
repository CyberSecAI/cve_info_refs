- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Event Espresso 4 Decaf plugin for WordPress lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to perform unwanted actions while authenticated. The impact of this vulnerability varies depending on the specific actions the plugin allows.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted request sent by an attacker, which is triggered when a logged-in user with sufficient privileges visits a malicious website or interacts with malicious content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into visiting a malicious website or interacting with malicious content that triggers a crafted request to the vulnerable plugin. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
