Based on the provided information, this CVE relates to a double-free vulnerability in the `igen6_edac` driver within the Linux kernel.

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a double-free issue during module unload. The `mci->pvt_info` pointer, which points to a memory region within `igen6_pvt`, is freed twice. The first free occurs in `mci_release()` within `edac_mc.c`, and the second free occurs in `igen6_remove()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double-free vulnerability: The same memory region is freed twice, which can lead to memory corruption and a segmentation fault.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault: The most immediate impact of this vulnerability is a kernel crash (segmentation fault) upon module removal.
- Memory corruption: Double frees can lead to memory corruption, which may have unpredictable consequences for the system's stability and security.

**Attack vectors:**
- Module unloading: The vulnerability is triggered during the unloading of the `igen6_edac` module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Module loading/unloading: An attacker needs the ability to load and unload kernel modules, which typically requires root privileges or the appropriate capabilities.

**More detail than the official CVE description:**
The provided content gives a detailed explanation of the root cause of the double-free, including how `igen6_pvt` and `mci->pvt_info` are allocated and freed. It also specifies the exact functions (`mci_release`, `igen6_remove`, `igen6_probe`, `igen6_register_mci`) involved in the vulnerability and its fix. It also provides the specific lines of code that were changed to fix this issue.
