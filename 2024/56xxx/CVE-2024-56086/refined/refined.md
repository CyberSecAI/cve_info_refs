Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability of authenticated users to inject malicious payloads within Report Templates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The core issue is that the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input within report templates, allowing for the injection of malicious commands.
*   Lack of input validation: The system fails to properly sanitize inputs to the report template.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Logpoint. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Report Template Manipulation:** An attacker with authenticated access to the Logpoint system can create or modify Report Templates by inserting malicious code.
*   **Backup Process Trigger:** The injected code is executed when the system's backup process is initiated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials for the Logpoint system.
*   **Low Privileges:** The advisory specifies "PR:L", indicating that even a low-privileged authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability.
