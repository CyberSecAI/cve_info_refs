Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2024-56608.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An out-of-bounds access vulnerability exists in the `dcn21_link_encoder_create` function within the AMDGPU driver. The `hpd_source` index, used to access the `link_enc_hpd_regs` array, was not validated against the array's boundaries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The code attempts to access an array element using an index that exceeds the valid range of the array. Specifically, the `hpd_source` value is used as an index into the `link_enc_hpd_regs` array, which has a fixed size.
- Lack of input validation: The code fails to check if the `hpd_source` index is within the bounds of the `link_enc_hpd_regs` array before accessing it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Undefined behavior: Accessing memory outside the allocated array can lead to unpredictable behavior, including system instability, crashes, or potentially exploitable conditions. The provided crash log shows a kernel panic triggered by this issue.
- Denial of service: By providing an out-of-bounds `hpd_source` value, an attacker could cause the system to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `dcn21_link_encoder_create` function is called with an `enc_init_data` structure where `hpd_source` is an out-of-bounds value. This function is part of the display initialization process of the amdgpu driver.
- The vulnerability could potentially be triggered by a user-space program causing a specific configuration which results in the driver using an invalid `hpd_source` value, which is then used to access the `link_enc_hpd_regs` array out of bounds.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to influence the `hpd_source` value that is passed to the `dcn21_link_encoder_create` function. This likely means having the ability to interact with the display system or the AMDGPU driver.
- The attacker needs to be able to load the amdgpu driver, which requires some level of system access, but not necessarily root access.

The provided patch adds a conditional check to ensure that the `hpd_source` index is within the valid range of the `link_enc_hpd_regs` array. If the index is out of bounds, the function now returns NULL, preventing the out-of-bounds access.
