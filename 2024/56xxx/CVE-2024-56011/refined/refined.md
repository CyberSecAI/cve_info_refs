- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Responsive Google Maps plugin (versions <= 1.2.5) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper sanitization of user-supplied input, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can inject arbitrary scripts (e.g., redirects, advertisements, HTML payloads) into the website. These scripts will execute when other users visit the affected pages.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited via injection of malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires the 'Contributor' privilege to inject the malicious script.
