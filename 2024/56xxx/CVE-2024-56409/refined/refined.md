Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-56409

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `currency` parameter in the `/vendor/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/samples/Wizards/NumberFormat/Currency.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. User-supplied input (`currency` parameter) is directly incorporated into the HTML output without proper sanitization or encoding.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application fails to validate and sanitize user-provided input before using it in the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when the vulnerable page is accessed. This can lead to various malicious activities.
*   **Account Hijacking:** If the application uses cookies for session management, an attacker can use XSS to steal cookies to impersonate users.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker can steal data displayed in the page.
*   **Phishing:** Attacker can display a fake login form and steal credentials.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker can modify the appearance of the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network by crafting a malicious URL or HTML form targeting the vulnerable script.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to be lured into opening a malicious link or submitting a form with the crafted XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the target system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Request:** The attacker needs the ability to craft an HTTP POST request with the malicious payload in the `currency` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker may need to use social engineering techniques to trick the victim into submitting the crafted request.

**Technical Details:**

The provided code snippet (Listing 5) shows an example of an HTML form that can be used to exploit the vulnerability. It demonstrates how to craft a POST request with a malicious JavaScript payload in the `currency` parameter.

The `Currency.php` script takes several parameters: `number`, `currency`, `decimals`, `position`, `spacing`, and `submit`. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the script uses the `currency` parameter to generate output without encoding the HTML characters, leading to the execution of malicious JavaScript within the userâ€™s browser.

**Mitigation:**

The advisory suggests sanitization of the `currency` variable as a mitigation strategy, which can be achieved by encoding HTML entities. The fix is released in versions 3.7.0, 1.29.7, 2.1.6, and 2.3.5 which implements HTML entity encoding.

**Additional Notes:**

The provided content also includes the CVSS v3.1 and v4.0 vectors which further details the impact and exploitability metrics of this vulnerability:

*   **CVSS v3.1:** 8.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N)
*   **CVSS v4.0:** 8.3 (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:L/SI:H/SA:L)

These metrics highlight the network-based attack vector, low attack complexity, the need for user interaction, the high integrity impact and low confidentiality impact of this vulnerability.

The provided commit diffs show the changes made to several files. Most notably,  `samples/Wizards/NumberFormat/Currency.php`, shows how the `negative` setting was added to the currency formatting. However, the diff does not show the XSS fix.

The provided content gives a detailed explanation of the XSS vulnerability, including how to exploit it, and is consistent with the CVE description (once placeholder is removed).
