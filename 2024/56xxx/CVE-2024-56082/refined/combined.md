| Hi, sorry for reporting it here. I found a way to exfiltrate data from the user's chat because of the nature of the plugin that allows it to render most of the HTML tag and the default plugin RAG behavior. The issue occurs when a malicious website ask the local LLM model to injects an img tag via Indirect Prompt Injection into the content displayed by the plugin. This tag can trigger unauthorized data transmission to an external server controlled by the attacker when the user is actively chatting through the plugin while visiting the malicious site. I think most of the models will gladly put a simple image tag to the response, but so far I've just tried it with Llama 3.2 and Mistral.  Tested Version: 1.0.16 (Latest)  **Vulnerability Description:**  Lumos allows users to interact with a local LLM through a chat interface. During the default configuration usage, the plugin may render output from the current page that user is visiting in. However, when a malicious website is open, it can exploit the plugin's failure to sanitize output properly. Specifically, by embedding an  HTML tag with a source pointing to the attacker’s server, the malicious site can capture sensitive data from the user's chat interactions and transmit it to an external location without user consent.  **Impact**  This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive information from the user's LLM chat, which could include confidential conversations, sensitive personal information, or other data handled during the plugin's use.  Exploitation Requirements: The attacker must host a malicious site and lure the user to visit it while they are actively using Lumos for LLM-based chat. As long as the 'Disable Content Parsing' feature is not enabled, the user can just ask anything while its in the malicious website tab for the exploitation to be successful.  **Simple PoC**  The attacker could hide the malicious prompt as seen in the screenshot below.

But with different models behaviors and unpredictability of the answer from AI, a payload (hidden prompt) will not be able to work in all model, a little bit customization may be required to the payload for it to work to specific model.

Implement proper output sanitization in the Lumos plugin to ensure that HTML tags, especially <img>, are escaped before being rendered. 2. If possible, enforce strict content security policies (CSP) to prevent external sources from being injected into the plugin’s context.  ```  Thanks. |

| Hi Andrew. Just want to check since I'm not too familiar with browser extension. If you want to implement the input / output validation in the plugin, where and what will the fix be? Do you have to manually code for the input sanitization in the text box or is there simple way to do it? I tried to look at the javascript file but can't identify where the fix should be implemented. Thanks. |

| I'm not sure what the solution will be yet. The issue is related to the `Markdown` component, which is used to render the input/output: <https://github.com/andrewnguonly/Lumos/blob/main/src/components/ChatBar.tsx#L724-L733> |

| I see, thanks for the information. I see that you're using markdown-to-jsx library, I think you can just use the disableParsingRawHTML: true to stop it from rendering HTML tags in input and output of the text box. Other alternative is to encode certain characters like <, /, >, etc.  References: [quantizor/markdown-to-jsx#278](https://github.com/quantizor/markdown-to-jsx/pull/278) [quantizor/markdown-to-jsx@852e80f](https://github.com/quantizor/markdown-to-jsx/commit/852e80fe1f92274cacb622bc51c4430531861a49) |

`markdown-to-jsx` uses a heavily-modified fork of [simple-markdown](https://github.com/Khan/simple-markdown) as its parsing engine and extends it in a number of ways to make your life easier. Notably, this package offers the following additional benefits:
- Arbitrary HTML is supported and parsed into the appropriate JSX representation without `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Any HTML tags rendered by the compiler and/or `<Markdown>` component can be overridden to include additional props or even a different HTML representation entirely.
- GFM task list support.
- Fenced code blocks with [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) support; see [Syntax highlighting](#syntax-highlighting) for instructions on setting up highlight.js.
All this clocks in at around 6 kB gzipped, which is a fraction of the size of most other React markdown components.
Requires React >= 0.14.
## Installation
Install `markdown-to-jsx` with your favorite package manager.
```shellnpm i markdown-to-jsx```
## Usage
`markdown-to-jsx` exports a React component by default for easy JSX composition:
ES6-style usage\\*:
```jsximport Markdown from 'markdown-to-jsx'import React from 'react'import { render } from 'react-dom'
render(<Markdown># Hello world!</Markdown>, document.body)
/\* renders:
 <h1>Hello world!</h1> \*/```
\\* \*\*NOTE: JSX does not natively preserve newlines in multiline text. In general, writing markdown directly in JSX is discouraged and it's a better idea to keep your content in separate .md files and require them, perhaps using webpack's [raw-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/raw-loader).\*\*
### Parsing Options
#### options.forceBlock
By default, the compiler will try to make an intelligent guess about the content passed and wrap it in a `<div>`, `<p>`, or `<span>` as needed to satisfy the "inline"-ness of the markdown. For instance, this string would be considered "inline":
```mdHello. \_Beautiful\_ day isn't it?```
But this string would be considered "block" due to the existence of a header tag, which is a block-level HTML element:
```md# Whaddup?```
However, if you really want all input strings to be treated as "block" layout, simply pass `options.forceBlock = true` like this:
```jsx;<Markdown options={{ forceBlock: true }}>Hello there old chap!</Markdown>
// or
compiler('Hello there old chap!', { forceBlock: true })
// renders;<p>Hello there old chap!</p>```
#### options.forceInline
The inverse is also available by passing `options.forceInline = true`:
```jsx;<Markdown options={{ forceInline: true }}># You got it babe!</Markdown>
// or
compiler('# You got it babe!', { forceInline: true })
// renders;<span># You got it babe!</span>```
#### options.wrapper
When there are multiple children to be rendered, the compiler will wrap the output in a `div` by default. You can override this default by setting the `wrapper` option to either a string (React Element) or a component.
```jsxconst str = '# Heck Yes\n\nThis is great!'
<Markdown options={{ wrapper: 'article' }}> {str}</Markdown>;
// or
compiler(str, { wrapper: 'article' });
// renders
<article> <h1>Heck Yes</h1> <p>This is great!</p></article>```
##### Other useful recipes
To get an array of children back without a wrapper, set `wrapper` to `null`. This is particularly useful when using `compiler(…)` directly.
```jsxcompiler('One\n\nTwo\n\nThree', { wrapper: null })
// returns;[<p>One</p>, <p>Two</p>, <p>Three</p>]```
To render children at the same DOM level as `<Markdown>` with no HTML wrapper, set `wrapper` to `React.Fragment`. This will still wrap your children in a React node for the purposes of rendering, but the wrapper element won't show up in the DOM.
#### options.forceWrapper
By default, the compiler does not wrap the rendered contents if there is only a single child. You can change this by setting `forceWrapper` to `true`. If the child is inline, it will not necessarily be wrapped in a `span`.
```jsx// Using `forceWrapper` with a single, inline child…<Markdown options={{ wrapper: 'aside', forceWrapper: true }}> Mumble, mumble…</Markdown>
// renders
<aside>Mumble, mumble…</aside>```
#### options.overrides - Override Any HTML Tag's Representation
Pass the `options.overrides` prop to the compiler or `<Markdown>` component to seamlessly revise the rendered representation of any HTML tag. You can choose to change the component itself, add/change props, or both.
```jsximport Markdown from 'markdown-to-jsx'import React from 'react'import { render } from 'react-dom'
// surprise, it's a div instead!const MyParagraph = ({ children, ...props }) => <div {...props}>{children}</div>
render( <Markdown options={{ overrides: { h1: { component: MyParagraph, props: { className: 'foo', }, }, }, }} > # Hello world! </Markdown>, document.body)
/\* renders:
 <div class="foo"> Hello World </div> \*/```
If you only wish to provide a component override, a simplified syntax is available:
```js{ overrides: { h1: MyParagraph, },}```
Depending on the type of element, there are some props that must be preserved to ensure the markdown is converted as intended. They are:
- `a`: `title`, `href`- `img`: `title`, `alt`, `src`- `input[type="checkbox"]`: `checked`, `readonly` (specifically, the one rendered by a GFM task list)- `ol`: `start`- `td`: `style`- `th`: `style`
Any conflicts between passed `props` and the specific properties above will be resolved in favor of `markdown-to-jsx`'s code.
Some element mappings are a bit different from other libraries, in particular:
- `span`: Used for inline text.- `code`: Used for inline code.- `pre > code`: Code blocks are a `code` element with a `pre` as its direct ancestor.
#### options.overrides - Rendering Arbitrary React Components
One of the most interesting use cases enabled by the HTML syntax processing in `markdown-to-jsx` is the ability to use any kind of element, even ones that aren't real HTML tags like React component classes.
By adding an override for the components you plan to use in markdown documents, it's possible to dynamically render almost anything. One possible scenario could be writing documentation:
```jsximport Markdown from 'markdown-to-jsx'import React from 'react'import { render } from 'react-dom'
import DatePicker from './date-picker'
const md = `# DatePicker
The DatePicker works by supplying a date to bias towards,as well as a default timezone.
<DatePicker biasTowardDateTime="2017-12-05T07:39:36.091Z" timezone="UTC+5" />`
render( <Markdown children={md} options={{ overrides: { DatePicker: { component: DatePicker, }, }, }} />, document.body)```
`markdown-to-jsx` also handles JSX interpolation syntax, but in a minimal way to not introduce a potential attack vector. Interpolations are sent to the component as their raw string, which the consumer can then `eval()` or process as desired to their security needs.
In the following case, `DatePicker` could simply run `parseInt()` on the passed `startTime` for example:
```jsximport Markdown from 'markdown-to-jsx'import React from 'react'import { render } from 'react-dom'
import DatePicker from './date-picker'
const md = `# DatePicker
The DatePicker works by supplying a date to bias towards,as well as a default timezone.
<DatePicker biasTowardDateTime="2017-12-05T07:39:36.091Z" timezone="UTC+5" startTime={1514579720511}/>`
render( <Markdown children={md} options={{ overrides: { DatePicker: { component: DatePicker, }, }, }} />, document.body)```
Another possibility is to use something like [recompose's `withProps()` HOC](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/blob/main/docs/API.md#withprops) to create various pregenerated scenarios and then reference them by name in the markdown:
```jsximport Markdown from 'markdown-to-jsx'import React from 'react'import { render } from 'react-dom'import withProps from 'recompose/withProps'
import DatePicker from './date-picker'
const DecemberDatePicker = withProps({ range: { start: new Date('2017-12-01'), end: new Date('2017-12-31'), }, timezone: 'UTC+5',})(DatePicker)
const md = `# DatePicker
The DatePicker works by supplying a date to bias towards,as well as a default timezone.
<DatePicker biasTowardDateTime="2017-12-05T07:39:36.091Z" timezone="UTC+5" startTime={1514579720511}/>
Here's an example of a DatePicker pre-set to only the month of December:
<DecemberDatePicker />`
render( <Markdown children={md} options={{ overrides: { DatePicker, DecemberDatePicker, }, }} />, document.body)```
#### options.createElement - Custom React.createElement behavior
Sometimes, you might want to override the `React.createElement` default behavior to hook into the rendering process before the JSX gets rendered. This might be useful to add extra children or modify some props based on runtime conditions. The function mirrors the `React.createElement` function, so the params are [`type, [props], [...children]`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#createelement):
```javascriptimport Markdown from 'markdown-to-jsx'import React from 'react'import { render } from 'react-dom'
const md = `# Hello world`
render( <Markdown children={md} options={{ createElement(type, props, children) { return ( <div className="parent"> {React.createElement(type, props, children)} </div> ) }, }} />, document.body)```
#### options.enforceAtxHeadings
Forces the compiler to have space between hash sign `#` and the header text which is explicitly stated in the most of the [markdown specs](https://github.github.com/gfm/#atx-heading).
> The opening sequence of `#` characters must be followed by a space or by the end of line.
#### options.renderRule
Supply your own rendering function that can selectively override how \_rules\_ are rendered (note, this is different than \_`options.overrides`\_ which operates at the HTML tag level and is more general). You can use this functionality to do pretty much anything with an established AST node; here's an example of selectively overriding the "codeBlock" rule to process LaTeX syntax using the `@matejmazur/react-katex` library:
````tsximport Markdown, { RuleType } from 'markdown-to-jsx'import TeX from '@matejmazur/react-katex'
const exampleContent = 'Some important formula:\n\n```latex\nmathbb{N} = { a in mathbb{Z} : a > 0 }\n```\n'
function App() { return ( <Markdown children={exampleContent} options={{ renderRule(next, node, renderChildren, state) { if (node.type === RuleType.codeBlock && node.lang === 'latex') { return ( <TeX as="div" key={state.key}>{String.raw`${node.text}`}</TeX> ) }
 return next() }, }} /> )}````
#### options.sanitizer
By default a lightweight URL sanitizer function is provided to avoid common attack vectors that might be placed into the `href` of an anchor tag, for example. The sanitizer receives the input, the HTML tag being targeted, and the attribute name. The original function is available as a library export called `sanitizer`.
This can be overridden and replaced with a custom sanitizer if desired via `options.sanitizer`:
```jsx// sanitizer in this situation would receive:// ('javascript:alert("foo")', 'a', 'href')
;<Markdown options={{ sanitizer: (value, tag, attribute) => value }}> {`[foo](javascript:alert("foo"))`}</Markdown>
// or
compiler('[foo](javascript:alert("foo"))', { sanitizer: (value, tag, attribute) => value,})```
#### options.slugify
By default, a [lightweight deburring function](https://github.com/probablyup/markdown-to-jsx/blob/bc2f57412332dc670f066320c0f38d0252e0f057/index.js#L261-L275) is used to generate an HTML id from headings. You can override this by passing a function to `options.slugify`. This is helpful when you are using non-alphanumeric characters (e.g. Chinese or Japanese characters) in headings. For example:
```jsx<Markdown options={{ slugify: str => str }}># 中文</Markdown>
// or
compiler('# 中文', { slugify: str => str })
// renders:<h1 id="中文">中文</h1>```
The original function is available as a library export called `slugify`.
#### options.namedCodesToUnicode
By default only a couple of named html codes are converted to unicode characters:
- `&` (`&amp;`)- `'` (`&apos;`)- `>` (`&gt;`)- `<` (`&lt;`)- ` ` (`&nbsp;`)- `"` (`&quot;`)
Some projects require to extend this map of named codes and unicode characters. To customize this list with additional html codes pass the option namedCodesToUnicode as object with the code names needed as in the example below:
```jsx<Markdown options={{ namedCodesToUnicode: { le: '\u2264', ge: '\u2265', '#39': '\u0027',} }}>This text is &le; than this text.</Markdown>;
// or
compiler('This text is &le; than this text.', namedCodesToUnicode: { le: '\u2264', ge: '\u2265', '#39': '\u0027',});
// renders:
<p>This text is ≤ than this text.</p>```
#### options.disableAutoLink
By default, bare URLs in the markdown document will be converted into an anchor tag. This behavior can be disabled if desired.
```jsx<Markdown options={{ disableAutoLink: true }}> The URL https://quantizor.dev will not be rendered as an anchor tag.</Markdown>
// or
compiler( 'The URL https://quantizor.dev will not be rendered as an anchor tag.', { disableAutoLink: true })
// renders:
<span> The URL https://quantizor.dev will not be rendered as an anchor tag.</span>```
#### options.disableParsingRawHTML
By default, raw HTML is parsed to JSX. This behavior can be disabled if desired.
```jsx<Markdown options={{ disableParsingRawHTML: true }}> This text has <span>html</span> in it but it won't be rendered</Markdown>;
// or
compiler('This text has <span>html</span> in it but it won't be rendered', { disableParsingRawHTML: true });
// renders:
<span>This text has &lt;span&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; in it but it won't be rendered</span>```
### Syntax highlighting
When using [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#syntax-highlighting) with language annotation, that language will be added to the `<code>` element as `class="lang-${language}"`. For best results, you can use `options.overrides` to provide an appropriate syntax highlighting integration like this one using `highlight.js`:
````jsximport { Markdown, RuleType } from 'markdown-to-jsx'
const mdContainingFencedCodeBlock = '```js\nconsole.log("Hello world!");\n```\n'
function App() { return ( <Markdown children={mdContainingFencedCodeBlock} options={{ overrides: { code: SyntaxHighlightedCode, }, }} /> )}
/\*\* \* Add the following tags to your page <head> to automatically load hljs and styles:
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@highlightjs/cdn-assets@11.9.0/styles/nord.min.css" />
 \* NOTE: for best performance, load individual languages you need instead of all of them. See their docs for more info: https://highlightjs.org/
 <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/@highlightjs/cdn-assets@11.9.0/highlight.min.js" ></script> \*/
function SyntaxHighlightedCode(props) { const ref = (React.useRef < HTMLElement) | (null > null)
 React.useEffect(() => { if (ref.current && props.className?.includes('lang-') && window.hljs) { window.hljs.highlightElement(ref.current)
 // hljs won't reprocess the element unless this attribute is removed ref.current.removeAttribute('data-highlighted') } }, [props.className, props.children])
 return <code {...props} ref={ref} />}````
### Getting the smallest possible bundle size
Many development conveniences are placed behind `process.env.NODE\_ENV !== "production"` conditionals. When bundling your app, it's a good idea to replace these code snippets such that a minifier (like uglify) can sweep them away and leave a smaller overall bundle.
Here are instructions for some of the popular bundlers:
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/#specify-the-environment)- [browserify plugin](https://github.com/hughsk/envify)- [parcel](https://parceljs.org/production.html)- [fuse-box](http://fuse-box.org/plugins/replace-plugin#notes)
### Usage with Preact
Everything will work just fine! Simply [Alias `react` to `preact/compat`](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/switching-to-preact#setting-up-compat) like you probably already are doing.
## Gotchas
### Passing props to stringified React components
Using the [`options.overrides`](#optionsoverrides---rendering-arbitrary-react-components) functionality to render React components, props are passed into the component in stringifed form. It is up to you to parse the string to make use of the data.
```tsxconst Table: React.FC< JSX.IntrinsicElements['table'] & { columns: string dataSource: string }> = ({ columns, dataSource, ...props }) => { const parsedColumns = JSON.parse(columns) const parsedData = JSON.parse(dataSource)
 return ( <div {...props}> <h1>Columns</h1> {parsedColumns.map(column => ( <span key={column.key}>{column.title}</span> ))}
 <h2>Data</h2> {parsedData.map(datum => ( <span key={datum.key}>{datum.Month}</span> ))} </div> )}
/\*\* \* Example HTML in markdown: \* \* <Table \* columns={[{ title: 'Month', dataIndex: 'Month', key: 'Month' }]} \* dataSource={[ \* { \* Month: '2024-09-01', \* 'Forecasted Revenue': '$3,137,678.85', \* 'Forecasted Expenses': '$2,036,660.28', \* key: 0, \* }, \* ]} \* /> \*/```
### Significant indentation inside arbitrary HTML
People usually write HTML like this:
```html<div>Hey, how are you?</div>```
Note the leading spaces before the inner content. This sort of thing unfortunately clashes with existing markdown syntaxes since 4 spaces === a code block and other similar collisions.
To get around this, `markdown-to-jsx` left-trims approximately as much whitespace as the first line inside the HTML block. So for example:
```html<div># Hello How are you?</div>```
The two leading spaces in front of "# Hello" would be left-trimmed from all lines inside the HTML block. In the event that there are varying amounts of indentation, only the amount of the first line is trimmed.
> NOTE! These syntaxes work just fine when you aren't writing arbitrary HTML wrappers inside your markdown. This is very much an edge case of an edge case. 🙃
#### Code blocks
⛔️
```md<div> var some = code();</div>```
✅
````md<div>```jsvar some = code();``\`</div>````
## Using The Compiler Directly
If desired, the compiler function is a "named" export on the `markdown-to-jsx` module:
```jsximport { compiler } from 'markdown-to-jsx'import React from 'react'import { render } from 'react-dom'
render(compiler('# Hello world!'), document.body)
/\* renders:
 <h1>Hello world!</h1> \*/```
It accepts the following arguments:
```jscompiler(markdown: string, options: object?)```
