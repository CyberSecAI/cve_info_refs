```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing deinitialization step for the cleaner shader in the gfx_v9_0 module of the AMDGPU driver.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The lack of deinitialization of the cleaner shader in the gfx_v9_0_sw_fini function leads to a memory leak. This occurs because resources allocated for the cleaner shader are not freed when the driver module is unloaded or the GPU is deinitialized.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact of this vulnerability is a potential memory leak. This can lead to resource exhaustion if the driver is frequently loaded and unloaded, potentially causing system instability or performance degradation.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the deinitialization of the AMDGPU driver or when a GPU using the gfx_v9_0 architecture is shut down. An attacker would need to cause repeated loading and unloading of the driver to exacerbate the memory leak.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to have the ability to load and unload kernel modules, or trigger GPU device initialization and deinitialization. This typically requires root or administrator privileges."
