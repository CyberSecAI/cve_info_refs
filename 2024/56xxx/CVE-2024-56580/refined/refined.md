Based on the provided information, both git commits relate to the same vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Qualcomm Camera Subsystem (CAMSS) driver. The commits address an error handling issue during the configuration of power domains.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from an improper error handling path in the `camss_configure_pd` function of the CAMSS driver. Specifically, when `dev_pm_domain_attach()` fails (either by name or id), the error path could lead to `dev_pm_domain_detach()` being called with a NULL or error pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **NULL pointer dereference:** The core weakness is the possibility of calling `dev_pm_domain_detach()` with a NULL pointer.
- **Incorrect error handling:**  The code didn't correctly handle errors returned by `dev_pm_domain_attach` resulting in the incorrect function being called on error.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel crash:** Calling `dev_pm_domain_detach()` with a NULL pointer leads to a kernel NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a system crash.
- **Denial of Service:** The crash can cause a denial-of-service as the system becomes unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Driver probing:** The vulnerability can be triggered by probing the CAMSS driver before the required power domains are registered. This can happen if the platform CAMCC driver is not built or loaded before the CAMSS driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the order in which drivers are loaded or probe specific drivers.
- The attacker would need to trigger the CAMSS driver initialization and power domain configuration under specific conditions. For example,  by controlling the loading order of kernel modules or using a modified device tree.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commits are fixes for the vulnerability.
- The commit messages provide a backtrace example of the crash and steps to reproduce the problem which are very helpful to understand the issue.
- The fix involves changing the error handling within the `camss_configure_pd` function to return an error instead of jumping to the `fail_pm` label and eventually calling the incorrect detach function with a NULL pointer.

The vulnerability is located in `drivers/media/platform/qcom/camss/camss.c`.
