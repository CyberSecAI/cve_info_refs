- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that a session cookie can be copied before a user logs out, which can then be used to hijack the session. Although the session token is invalidated on logout, if captured beforehand, it remains valid until expiry or manual clearing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session token interception, potentially through man-in-the-middle attacks, XSS, or direct access to the victim's device.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a user's session, allowing them to potentially perform actions as that user until the session expires or is manually cleared.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, exploiting XSS vulnerabilities, or gaining direct access to the victim's device to copy the session cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept or access the session cookie during an active user session. This could involve network interception (MitM), exploiting other vulnerabilities such as XSS, or direct access to the user's system. The attacker also needs high privileges according to the CVSS score.
