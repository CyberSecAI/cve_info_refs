{
  "CVE-2024-56702": {
    "Description": "The Linux kernel's BPF verifier incorrectly handles raw tracepoint arguments, treating them as non-NULL trusted pointers, when in reality they can be NULL. This leads to the verifier removing explicit NULL checks, which may cause the kernel to crash when dereferencing a NULL pointer.",
    "Root cause": "The BPF verifier incorrectly assumes raw tracepoint arguments are non-NULL trusted pointers.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect assumption about the non-NULL nature of raw tracepoint arguments",
      "Deletion of explicit NULL checks by the verifier",
      "Lack of proper handling for possibly NULL pointers in the verifier"
    ],
    "Impact": "Kernel crash due to dereferencing a NULL pointer.",
    "Attack vectors": "Loading a crafted BPF program that accesses raw tracepoint arguments that can be NULL without prior null check.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to load a BPF program.",
    "More details": "The fix marks raw_tp arguments as PTR_MAYBE_NULL and then special cases the dereference and pointer arithmetic to permit it, and allow passing them into helpers/kfuncs; these exceptions are made for raw_tp programs only. A masking logic is introduced to handle cases when the register is rechecked and considered untrusted due to the PTR_MAYBE_NULL flag. PROBE_MEM marking is enabled when loads into trusted pointers with PTR_MAYBE_NULL are observed to allow safe dereference."
