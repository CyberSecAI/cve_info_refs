The provided content relates to a fix for a potential stack overflow vulnerability in the Linux kernel, specifically within the `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function. This aligns with the provided CVE description of a PLACEHOLDER.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function previously declared a large `cu_occupancy` array as a local variable on the stack. When `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` was large, this could lead to excessive stack usage, potentially causing a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow due to large stack allocation.
- Potential for denial-of-service or unexpected behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A stack overflow in kernel space can lead to crashes or other unexpected behavior which can lead to denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function with a large `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to interact with the AMD KFD driver and influence the `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` setting which would require a local user with proper privileges to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Fix:**
The fix replaces the static array allocation with dynamic memory allocation using `kcalloc`. This allocates the memory from the heap instead of the stack, avoiding the stack overflow. The allocated memory is then freed with `kfree` before the function returns. This also includes an error check to return `-ENOMEM` if memory allocation fails.
