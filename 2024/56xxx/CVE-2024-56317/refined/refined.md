- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `WriteAcl` function in the connectedhomeip project deletes all existing Access Control List (ACL) entries before attempting to create new ones based on user input. If the input validation fails during the decoding of the new entries, the process stops and no entries are restored, leaving the ACL list empty and inaccessible.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - The write request handling mechanism does not separate creation, modification, and deletion of ACL entries.
  - The function `WriteAcl` deletes all existing entries before validating and recreating new entries.
  - The TLV decoding process is sequential, and invalid entries are not caught before deletion of the existing entries.
  - The implementation violates the Matter Core Specification guidelines by deleting entries before input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  -  Deletion of all ACL entries can isolate the device, blocking access for all users, including administrators.
  - This can lead to severe operational risks in environments requiring secure and consistent access to devices.
  - Without any access, immediate corrective actions are impossible, compromising the reliability and stability of dependent systems.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Sending a write request with an invalid value for an ACL entry.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to send a write request to the access control endpoint. This likely implies network access to the device.
