## Description

![@BoB13-Matter](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181179481?v=4&size=48)[BoB13-Matter](https://github.com/BoB13-Matter)opened [on Nov 18, 2024](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/issues/36535#issue-2668618271)
### Reproduction steps

1. After pairing, check the ACL as follows:

   ```
   $ ./chip-tool accesscontrol read acl 1 0
   ...
   [TOO] ACL: 1 entries
   [TOO]   [1]: {
   [TOO]     Privilege: 5
   [TOO]     AuthMode: 2
   [TOO]     Subjects: 112233
   [TOO]     Targets: null
   [TOO]     FabricIndex: 1
   [TOO]   }
   ...
   ```
2. Send a write request with an invalid value:

   ```
   $ ./chip-tool accesscontrol write acl '[{"privilege":99,"authMode":2,"subjects":[112233],"fabricIndex":1}]' 1 0
   ...
   [TOO] Response Failure: IM Error 0x87 (CONSTRAINT_ERROR)
   ...
   ```
3. Despite returning a `CONSTRAINT_ERROR`, all entries are deleted, leaving the ACL list empty and inaccessible.

### Anything else?

## Summary

1. The commands for creating, modifying, and deleting entries are not separated; therefore, users must send a write request to update an entry (e.g., `accesscontrol write acl`, `binding write binding`).
2. Some functions that handle write requests (e.g., `WriteAcl`, `WriteBindingTable`, etc.) operate by deleting all existing entries and recreating them based on the user's input.
3. This approach can introduce unintended vulnerabilities. Specifically, if all ACLs (Access Control Lists) are deleted, it can block access not only for devices within the same fabric but also for the administrator.

Although this issue was mentioned in [#36420](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/issues/36420), I believe the vulnerability in the write command processing structure needs to be addressed, so I'm reopening this issue.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Key Problem:** The `WriteAcl` function deletes all existing entries first and attempts to recreate them based on user input. If input validation fails during decoding, the process stops, and no entries are restored.
2. **Sequential Logic:** Since TLV decoding is processed from start to finish, invalid entries cannot be caught before deletion. This means:
   * The system deletes all existing entries (`ReplaceAll`).
   * It then tries to decode and create new entries.
   * If decoding fails, the ACL remains empty.

## Additional Analysis

1. The packet captured by Wireshark for the command `accesscontrol write acl '[{"privilege":5,"authMode":2,"subjects":[112233],"targets":[],"fabricIndex":1}]' 1 0` looks as follows:

* Here, the first TLV structure `{ 1=<…>, 2=[] }` represents `ReplaceAll` when processed in the code and deletes everything.
* The second TLV structure `{ 1=<…>, 2={…} }` represents `AppendItem` when processed in the code and adds a new entry to the empty list.

⇒ I believe that the structure of the Write request itself is the root cause of this issue.

2. According to *Matter Core Specification:*

   ```
   9.1.6.2. Administration Guidelines
   Administrators SHOULD be careful to avoid inadvertently removing their own administrative access. For example, an Administrator SHOULD change its own administrative access entry by updating the existing entry or by creating a new entry before removing the old entry, and SHOULD NOT remove the old entry before creating any new entry.

   ```

* However, the current implementation violates this guideline by deleting entries before input validation.

## Description

Deleting all entries can isolate a device, blocking access for all users, including administrators. This can lead to severe operational risks in environments requiring secure and consistent access to devices. Without any access, immediate corrective actions are impossible, compromising the reliability and stability of dependent systems.

This vulnerability likely applies to other items such as Bindings, not just ACLs.

## Proposed Solutions

If a `CONSTRAINT_ERROR` is returned due to an invalid value in a Write Request, the existing entries should remain unchanged. While it would be ideal to validate the input before performing the changes, I understand that changing the processing order is challenging because the TLV structure is decoded and processed sequentially from the beginning.

Therefore, I propose one of the following approaches:

* **Change Write Command Processing:**
  + Record the intent to replace, and after ensuring that there are no errors during decoding, perform the `Delete` → `Create` operations.
* **Introduce explicit commands:**
  + Instead of implicitly handling additions, updates, and deletions with a single write command, provide separate commands like `Add`, `Remove`, and `Update`.
  + Similar to the Groups cluster has separate `add-group` and `remove-group` commands.
* **Change the structure of the current write command packet.**
* **Other solutions as appropriate.**
