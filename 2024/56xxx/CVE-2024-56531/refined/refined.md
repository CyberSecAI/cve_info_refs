{
  "CVE-2024-56531": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The USB disconnect callback in the ALSA caiaq driver was using `snd_card_free()` which waits for all file descriptors to be closed, potentially blocking USB ioctls and causing soft lockups. This was because the resource freeing was being done synchronously within the USB disconnect callback.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper resource management in USB disconnect callback leading to potential blocking."
      ],
      "impact": "The primary impact is a potential soft lockup due to the USB disconnect callback blocking upper-layer USB ioctls.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by disconnecting a Native Instrument USB audio device while it is in use, causing the resource freeing to block, and then attempting to interact with the device via USB ioctls.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to disconnect a Native Instrument USB audio device while the device is in use, and to issue USB ioctl commands."
    },
    "affected_components": [
      "ALSA caiaq driver for Native Instrument USB audio devices"
    ],
    "fix_details": "The fix replaces `snd_card_free()` with `snd_card_free_when_closed()`. This allows the USB disconnect callback to return immediately. The resource freeing is deferred and done asynchronously by the card device release at the last close. The disconnect and resource free code was split into two phases, disconnect during the callback and resource free during card destruction."
