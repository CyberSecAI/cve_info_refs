- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory leak occurs in the `reset_method_store()` function of the Linux kernel's PCI subsystem. The function allocates memory using `kstrndup()` to store a string of options, but if the string does not contain spaces, the subsequent loop using `strsep()` sets the `options` pointer to NULL without freeing the allocated memory, resulting in a memory leak.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak due to improper handling of dynamically allocated memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Repeated calls to `reset_method_store()` with a string without spaces can lead to memory exhaustion over time and potentially system instability or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by writing a string to the sysfs interface, which calls the vulnerable `reset_method_store()` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need the ability to write to the PCI sysfs interface, which typically requires root or elevated privileges.
