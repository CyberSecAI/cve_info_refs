{
  "CVE-2024-56571": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The UVC (USB Video Class) driver did not enforce the UVC specification that requires unit and terminal IDs to be non-zero and unique.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "The driver allowed the allocation of UVC entities (units and terminals) with an ID of 0, which is reserved for undefined IDs, and allowed duplicate IDs."
      ],
      "Impact": "This could lead to a variety of issues, including warnings, incorrect entity lookups, and potential instability. Specifically, it was observed to cause warnings due to a chain of entities referring to themselves, and backward chains were considered finished prematurely due to the source ID being 0. This could result in invalid pad access and other issues.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "A specially crafted USB device descriptor could define UVC entities with invalid IDs."
      ],
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to control the USB device connected to the vulnerable system."
      ]
    }
