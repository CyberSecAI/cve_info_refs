Based on the provided content, the vulnerability addressed by the commits is related to the incorrect handling of IRQ domains in the `intel_soc_pmic_bxtwc` driver within the Linux kernel. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**

- The driver was initially designed to use a hierarchy of IRQ chips. However, the implementation had flaws, particularly concerning the handling of virtual IRQs (vIRQs). The issue was triggered when `platform_get_irq()` started to WARN on IRQ 0 which is intended to be a Linux IRQ number (vIRQ)
- The driver incorrectly assumed that all MFD (Multi-Function Device) devices managed by the `intel_soc_pmic_bxtwc` driver have the same IRQ domain. This assumption is false, leading to improper IRQ handling for the TMU (Thermal Management Unit) device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect IRQ Domain Handling:** The driver was not respecting the separate IRQ domains required by the different MFD devices it managed, leading to potential interrupt misrouting.
- **Reliance on vIRQ 0:** The driver was not properly handling the case where `platform_get_irq()` returns 0, and using it as a physical IRQ number instead of the vIRQ.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Incorrect Interrupt Handling:** The primary impact is incorrect interrupt handling, especially for the TMU device. This could lead to:
    - Thermal management issues (inability to react to overheating conditions, for example)
    - Unpredictable behavior of the affected devices
    - System instability or malfunction
    - Potential for denial of service (if interrupt handling is completely broken).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local exploitation:** This vulnerability is primarily exploitable locally through device interaction.
- **Specific Hardware:** The vulnerability affects systems with Intel Whiskey Cove PMICs, particularly those that use the TMU.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker would require local access to the system to interact with the affected hardware.
- **System Access (to trigger the driver):** An attacker would also need to be able to initiate actions that trigger the problematic interrupt handling logic in the driver.

**Technical Details:**

The patch series restructures the driver to:
   - Use IRQ domains correctly by creating each MFD device separately.
   - Specifically handles the TMU device by adding `bxt_wc_tmu_dev` as a separate device
   - Modifies `bxtwc_probe` to use `bxtwc_add_chained_devices` when adding the TMU device.
   - Correctly retrieves the IRQ by using `platform_get_irq` and not attempting to use the vIRQ as the hardware interrupt.

The fix involves changes in `drivers/mfd/intel_soc_pmic_bxtwc.c` and `drivers/platform/x86/intel/bxtwc_tmu.c`. Specifically:

- The TMU device is now handled as separate MFD cell.
- The `bxtwc_probe()` function is modified to use the IRQ domain for each MFD device.
- `bxtwc_tmu.c` is modified to use `platform_get_irq()` to retrieve the correct IRQ to be used when registering the interrupt handler.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit messages clearly indicate that the issue was discovered due to `platform_get_irq()` warning on IRQ 0.
- The fix addresses the incorrect usage of the virtual IRQ number as the physical one.
- The fix also addressed the lack of respect for the IRQ domains when creating devices, causing the driver to misroute IRQs.

The provided content is a series of patches, all addressing the same underlying vulnerability. All of these commits appear to be related to the same fix. They represent the incremental integration and backporting of the fix to different branches of the Linux kernel.
