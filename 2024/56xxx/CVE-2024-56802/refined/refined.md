Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how DeployKeys were being retrieved by value in Tapir versions 0.9.0 and 0.9.1. The system was not performing an exact match when searching for a DeployKey by its value. Instead it was retrieving the first key that matched the provided value, allowing partial key matches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Key Retrieval:** The primary weakness is that the `getDeployKeyByValue` method in the `DynamodbRepository`, `CosmosDbRepository` and `ElasticSearchRepository` classes did not enforce an exact match of the key value. This allowed an attacker to potentially gain access with a substring of a valid deploy key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Write Access:** An attacker could potentially guess a deploy key (or a substring) and use it to gain write access to the registry, which could allow them to push malicious images or make other unauthorized changes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Key Guessing:** An attacker could attempt to guess a valid DeployKey by trying various substrings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Deploy Key Format:** The attacker would need some knowledge or ability to guess the structure of the deploy keys.
*  **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to interact with the registry API.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.9.2 by adding a filter to ensure an exact match of the deploy key when retrieving it by value. The fix is implemented in the `DynamodbRepository.java`, `CosmosDbRepository.java` and `ElasticSearchRepository.java` files.
* The provided commit also includes tests to verify this fix.
* The vulnerability is rated as high severity.
