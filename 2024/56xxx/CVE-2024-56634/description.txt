In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpio: grgpio: Add NULL check in grgpio_probe

devm_kasprintf() can return a NULL pointer on failure,but this
returned value in grgpio_probe is not checked.
Add NULL check in grgpio_probe, to handle kernel NULL
pointer dereference error.
