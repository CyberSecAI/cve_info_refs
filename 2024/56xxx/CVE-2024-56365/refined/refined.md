Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-56365

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `Downloader` class constructor within the PhpSpreadsheet library. The constructor processes GET parameters `name` and `type` without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code through these parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to neutralize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page. Specifically, the `name` and `type` GET parameters are used to generate error messages which are displayed to the user, and these are not sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Execution of Arbitrary JavaScript:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This could lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the web page, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
- **GET Parameters:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL with the `name` and `type` GET parameters, which are then passed to the vulnerable code.
- **User Interaction**: The attack requires user interaction, as the user needs to click on the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated/Unauthorized User:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL endpoint (`/vendor/phpoffice/phpspreadsheet/samples/download.php`).
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker must be able to create a URL with the malicious payload in the `name` and `type` parameters.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of phpspreadsheet `3.0.0` up to `3.6.0`, versions `1.29.6` and below, versions `2.0.0` up to `2.1.5`, and versions `2.2.0` up to `2.3.4`.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Aleksey Solovev (Positive Technologies).
- The fix involves sanitizing the `name` and `type` variables.
- The CVSS v3.1 score is 8.2 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N) and the CVSS v4.0 score is 8.3 (AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:L/SI:H/SA:L).
