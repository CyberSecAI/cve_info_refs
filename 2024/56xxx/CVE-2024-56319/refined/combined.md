[@yufengwangca](https://github.com/yufengwangca) please add a `Testing` section to your summary explaining how this was tested.

Since no test case was changed, I assume this was manual. We are trying to make manual annoying to type so that it is not done as a convenience, so please provide detailed test steps and explanation why automated testing was not possible (or better, if you can get some automated test that checks we get errors on large writes even better, unit test on DeviceInfoProvider if possible).

Sorry, something went wrong.

## Description

![@BoB13-Matter](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181179481?v=4&size=48)[BoB13-Matter](https://github.com/BoB13-Matter)opened [on Dec 8, 2024](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/issues/36760#issue-2725265622)
### Reproduction steps

1. Run `chip-tool` and `chip-all-clusters-app` separately:

   ```
   ./chip-tool interactive start
   ```

   ```
   ./chip-all-clusters-app
   ```
2. Write a user label list with a large number of entries using chip-tool:

   ```
   userlabel write label-list '[{"label":"roomName", "value":"master bedroom 1"}, {"label":"orientation", "value":"east"}, {"label":"floor", "value":"2"}, {"label":"roomType", "value":"bedroom"}, ... , {"label":"roomType", "value":"bedroom"}]' 1 0
   ```
   * Full command example: [command.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18052527/command.txt)
3. Observe the CPU usage and responsiveness of `chip-all-clusters-app` during the write operation:

   * CPU utilization reaches 100% and remains consistently high.
   * Processing times increase exponentially as more entries are appended, eventually resulting in timeout errors.
4. Attempt to read back the user label list:

   ```
   userlabel read label-list 1 0
   ```
   * CPU usage spikes again during the read operation, and timeout occurs before completion.

5. General system slowness: After adding many entries, even unrelated commands sent via `chip-tool` to other clusters become significantly slower. This suggests that excessive user label entries are affecting the overall responsiveness of the system.

---

### **Summary**

The User Label Cluster implementation in Matter allows an unlimited number of entries to be appended via the `WriteLabelList` function when using the `AppendItem` operation.

This lack of enforced maximum entries leads to:

* High CPU usage
* Prolonged processing times
* Timeout failures
* General degradation of system responsiveness, including unrelated Matter commands

Additionally, the unlimited append functionality creates a clear vector for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, particularly in resource-constrained IoT environments. An attacker could exploit this behavior to overload the device, rendering it unresponsive.

### **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue lies in the `WriteLabelList` function and the associated `AppendUserLabel` implementation. While `WriteLabelList` uses an `AttributeList` with a maximum size of `kMaxUserLabelListLength` (10) for overwriting operations, the `AppendItem` operation bypasses this limit entirely.

1. AppendItem Operation in `WriteLabelList`:

   ```
   if (aPath.mListOp == ConcreteDataAttributePath::ListOperation::AppendItem)
   {
       Structs::LabelStruct::DecodableType entry;

       // Validate the new entry's label and value lengths
       ReturnErrorOnFailure(aDecoder.Decode(entry));
       VerifyOrReturnError(IsValidLabelEntry(entry), CHIP_IM_GLOBAL_STATUS(ConstraintError));

       // Add the entry without checking total list size
       return provider->AppendUserLabel(endpoint, entry);
   }

   ```
2. Unlimited Append in `AppendUserLabel`:

   ```
   CHIP_ERROR DeviceInfoProvider::AppendUserLabel(EndpointId endpoint, const UserLabelType & label)
   {
       size_t length;

       // Fetch current list length and increase by 1
       ReturnErrorOnFailure(GetUserLabelLength(endpoint, length));
       ReturnErrorOnFailure(SetUserLabelLength(endpoint, length + 1));

       // Add the new entry to the end of the list
       ReturnErrorOnFailure(SetUserLabelAt(endpoint, length, label));

       return CHIP_NO_ERROR;
   }

   ```

This implementation lacks any mechanism to enforce a maximum entry limit during append operations.

### **Description**

**Expected Behavior:**

* The `AppendItem` operation should respect the maximum entry count defined by `kMaxUserLabelListLength` (10 by default).
* When the maximum number of entries is reached, subsequent append attempts should return an error (e.g., `CHIP_ERROR_NO_MEMORY`).

**Actual Behavior:**

* The append operation allows entries to be added indefinitely.
* Resource usage (CPU, memory, disk) escalates with each appended entry, leading to:
* The `/tmp/chip_kvs` file grows uncontrollably, consuming storage resources.

This behavior poses a risk for IoT devices with limited computational power and memory, potentially leading to service interruptions and making them vulnerable to exploitation.

### **Proposed Solution**

Introduce a check in `AppendUserLabel` to enforce the maximum entry limit:

```
CHIP_ERROR DeviceInfoProvider::AppendUserLabel(EndpointId endpoint, const UserLabelType & label)
{
    size_t length;

    // Fetch current list length
    ReturnErrorOnFailure(GetUserLabelLength(endpoint, length));

    // Enforce maximum entry limit
    if (length >= kMaxUserLabelListLength)
    {
        return CHIP_ERROR_NO_MEMORY; // Return an error if the limit is exceeded
    }

    // Add the new entry to the list
    ReturnErrorOnFailure(SetUserLabelLength(endpoint, length + 1));
    ReturnErrorOnFailure(SetUserLabelAt(endpoint, length, label));

    return CHIP_NO_ERROR;
}

```
