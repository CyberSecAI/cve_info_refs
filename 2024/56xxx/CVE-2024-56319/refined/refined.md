{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The User Label Cluster implementation in Matter allows an unlimited number of entries to be appended via the `WriteLabelList` function when using the `AppendItem` operation. The `AppendUserLabel` function lacks a check to enforce the maximum entry limit, leading to resource exhaustion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled resource consumption",
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Missing limit on append operations"
    ],
    "impact": "Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk), leading to prolonged processing times, timeout failures, and general degradation of system responsiveness. Allows for a denial-of-service (DoS) attack where an attacker could overload the device by adding an unlimited amount of user labels, rendering it unresponsive.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a large number of append requests to the user label list through the `WriteLabelList` function with the `AppendItem` operation."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send Matter commands to the target device, typically over a network."
  },
  "fixes": [
    {
      "commit": "e3277eb02ed8115de5887e8beca0e35007ba71f3",
       "description": "Introduced a check in `AppendUserLabel` to enforce the maximum entry limit, returning a `CHIP_ERROR_NO_MEMORY` error when the limit is exceeded. Added a new test case to `TestUserLabelClusterConstraints.yaml` to verify the fix."
    }
  ],
  "additional_info": {
    "vulnerability_details": "The vulnerability occurs because the `AppendItem` operation within the `WriteLabelList` function bypasses the `kMaxUserLabelListLength` limit, and the `AppendUserLabel` function does not check the total number of entries before appending a new one. This allows an attacker to continually add entries and exhaust system resources.",
      "affected_code_locations": [
        "src/app/clusters/user-label-server/user-label-server.cpp",
        "src/platform/DeviceInfoProvider.cpp"
      ],
      "test_added": "src/app/tests/suites/TestUserLabelClusterConstraints.yaml",
      "poc": "The issue was reproduced by sending multiple user label appends using `chip-tool` to a device running the `chip-all-clusters-app`, observing CPU usage and responsiveness."
