# SSRF Vulnerability via malicious scrape target

High

[nickscamara](/nickscamara)
published
GHSA-vjp8-2wgg-p734
Dec 30, 2024

## Package

firecrawl

## Affected versions

< 1.1.1

## Patched versions

1.1.1

## Description

### Impact

A pen-testing team has discovered an SSRF vulnerability in Firecrawl. The scraping engine could be exploited by crafting a malicious site that redirects to a local IP address. This allowed exfiltration of local network resources through the API.

### Patches

* The cloud service was patched on December 27th and we have checked that no user data was exposed by this vulnerability.
* Scraping engines used in the open sourced version of Firecrawl were patched on December 29th except for the playwright services which we have determined to be un-patchable. See the **workaround section** for instructions on how to secure the playwright services.

We strongly recommend that all of our OSS users update to the latest version of Firecrawl (**v1.1.1** at this time).

### Workarounds

We strongly recommend that OSS users supply the playwright services with a secure proxy. A proxy can be specified through the `PROXY_SERVER` env in the environment variables. Please refer to the documentation for instructions.

Please ensure that the proxy server you are using is setup to block all traffic going to link-local IP addresses.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
