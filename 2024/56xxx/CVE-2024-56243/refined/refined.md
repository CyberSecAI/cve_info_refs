- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user (specifically mentioned as a "Subscriber") could perform actions that should be reserved for higher-privileged users. The specific impact varies case by case.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a subscriber. The specific vulnerable function is not specified.
