# Improper handling of window title sequences can lead to arbitrary command execution

Moderate

[mitchellh](/mitchellh)
published
GHSA-5hcq-3j4q-4v6p
Dec 31, 2024

## Package

Ghostty
(Ghostty)

## Affected versions

1.0.0

## Patched versions

1.0.1

## Description

### Impact

Ghostty, as allowed by default in 1.0.0, allows attackers to modify the window title via a certain character escape sequence and then insert it back to the command line in the user's terminal, e.g. when the user views a file containing the malicious sequence, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.

This attack requires an attacker to send malicious escape sequences followed by convincing the user to physically press the "enter" key. I'm not aware of attacks that do not require user interaction.

### Patches

Fixed in Ghostty v1.0.1.

A new `title_report` configuration was added that defaults to false to disable title reporting (CSI 21 t). The documentation notes the security risk of enabling this feature, but it remains available for compatibility reasons.

PR: [#3908](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/3908)

### Workarounds

You can workaround the issue in Ghostty v1.0.0 by explicitly setting a title in the configuration. For example:

```
title = Ghostty
```

When a title is set, set title CSIs are ignored and report title in v1.0.0 will report your fixed title.
