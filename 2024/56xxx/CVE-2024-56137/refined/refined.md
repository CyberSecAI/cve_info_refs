- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A Remote Command Execution vulnerability exists in the function library module of MaxKB, specifically allowing execution of OS commands within custom scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote Command Execution (RCE) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges can execute arbitrary OS commands, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and service disruption.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks, specifically through the execution of custom scripts via the vulnerable function library module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires a privileged user account. User interaction is required for exploitation.
