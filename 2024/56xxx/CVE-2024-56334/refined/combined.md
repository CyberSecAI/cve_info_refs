# Command injection vulnerability in getWindowsIEEE8021x (SSID)

High

[sebhildebrandt](/sebhildebrandt)
published
GHSA-cvv5-9h9w-qp2m
Dec 20, 2024

## Package

npm

systeminformation
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<=5.23.6

## Patched versions

5.23.7

## Description

### Summary

The SSID is not sanitized when before it is passed as a parameter to cmd.exe in the `getWindowsIEEE8021x` function. This means that malicious content in the SSID can be executed as OS commands.

### Details

I have exploited this vulnerability in a Windows service using version 5.22.11 of the module, to escalate privileges (in an environment where I am authorized to do so). However, as far as I can see from the code, it is still present in master branch at time of writing, on line [403/404 of network.js](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation/blob/3a92931c7d46605ffddc1aacb97a9727273b2888/lib/network.js#L403).

The SSID is obtained from `netsh wlan show interface ...` in `getWindowsWirelessIfaceSSID`, and then passed to `cmd.exe /d /s /c "netsh wlan show profiles ...` in `getWindowsIEEE8021x`, without sanitization.

### PoC

First, the command injection payload should be included in the connected Wi-Fi SSID. For example create hotspot on mobile phone or other laptop, set SSID to payload, connect to it with victim Windows system. Two example SSID's to demonstrate exploitation are below.

Demonstration to run ping command indefinitely:

```
a" | ping /t 127.0.0.1 &

```

Run executable with privileges of the user in which vulnerable function is executed. Chosen executable should should be placed in (assuming system drive is C): `C:\a\a.exe`.

```
a" | %SystemDrive%\a\a.exe &

```

Then, the vulnerable function can be executed on the victim system, for example, using:

```
const si = require('systeminformation');
si.networkInterfaces((net) => { console.log(net) });

```

Now the chosen command, `PING.exe` or `a.exe` will be run through the cmd.exe command line.

### Impact

This vulnerability may enable an attacker, depending on how the package is used, to perform remote code execution or local privilege escalation.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
