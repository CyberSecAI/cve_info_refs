Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the `callbackURL` parameter in the `/verify-email` endpoint of the Better Auth library. Specifically, the origin check middleware only enforced for `POST` requests, which left `GET` requests, such as the `/verify-email` endpoint, vulnerable to open redirects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary URL by manipulating the `callbackURL` parameter in the email verification link.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The library lacks sufficient validation of the `callbackURL` parameter, failing to check if the target domain is trusted before redirecting the user.
- **Bypassed Origin Check:** The origin check middleware was not applied to GET requests, making the `/verify-email` endpoint vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites, such as fake login pages, to steal their credentials or other sensitive information.
- **Reputation Damage:** Applications using the vulnerable version of Better Auth may suffer trust issues due to the ability of attackers to exploit the open redirect.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Verification Links:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting malicious email verification links that contain a manipulated `callbackURL` parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled domain.
- **GET Request Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the fact that the vulnerable endpoint uses a `GET` request, and the origin check is only enforced for `POST` requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create or modify email verification links:** Attackers need to be able to craft or modify the email verification links, which they can do by either controlling the sending of verification emails or intercepting the messages somehow.
- **Ability to control a malicious domain:** The attacker needs to have control over the domain to which the user will be redirected to, in order to carry out the malicious activity.
