- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to force higher-privileged users to perform unintended actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users (like administrators) to execute unwanted actions within the WordPress site. The specific impact will vary depending on the actions that can be triggered through the vulnerable functionality.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into submitting it. This can be achieved via social engineering or other means.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no authentication to exploit the vulnerability, they must however be able to trick a privileged user into submitting the malicious request.
