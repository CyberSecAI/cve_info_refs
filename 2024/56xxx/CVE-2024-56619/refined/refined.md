Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2024-56619.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `nilfs_last_byte()` function within the NILFS2 filesystem driver. This function calculates the number of valid bytes of directory data in a page. The issue is that the function used an `unsigned int` to store the inode's `i_size`, which is a 64-bit value. When the `i_size` is large, the upper 32 bits are lost, resulting in incorrect calculations and potential memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer truncation: The use of `unsigned int` to store a 64-bit size leads to data loss.
- Out-of-bounds memory access: Due to the incorrect size calculation, memory access outside the intended page or folio can occur in `nilfs_find_entry()`.
- Potential Use-After-Free: If KASAN is enabled, a use-after-free bug might be detected due to the memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- Memory corruption, which may result in system instability, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.
- Denial of service by crashing the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Corrupting the `i_size` of a directory inode to a large value.
- Triggering a directory entry search that leads to calling `nilfs_find_entry()` with the corrupted inode.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to corrupt the inode's `i_size`, likely requiring privileged access to the filesystem.

The fix involves changing the type of the local variable `last_byte` in `nilfs_last_byte()` from `unsigned int` to `u64` to preserve the full 64-bit size information.
