In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: fix blksize < PAGE_SIZE for file-backed mounts

Adjust sb->s_blocksize{,_bits} directly for file-backed
mounts when the fs block size is smaller than PAGE_SIZE.

Previously, EROFS used sb_set_blocksize(), which caused
a panic if bdev-backed mounts is not used.
