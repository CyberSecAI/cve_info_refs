The provided content relates to a fix for a bug in the EROFS filesystem when used with file-backed mounts where the block size is smaller than the page size.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the incorrect usage of `sb_set_blocksize()` when setting the block size for file-backed EROFS mounts with a block size smaller than PAGE_SIZE. `sb_set_blocksize()` is designed for block device backed mounts, and its use in file-backed mounts resulted in a panic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of block size in `erofs_fc_fill_super()` function for file-backed mounts when the filesystem block size is less than PAGE\_SIZE.
- The use of `sb_set_blocksize()` in the context of file-backed mounts instead of directly setting `sb->s_blocksize` and `sb->s_blocksize_bits`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel panic when mounting an EROFS file system with a block size smaller than PAGE\_SIZE. This would cause a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Mounting an EROFS filesystem from a file, where the filesystem's block size is configured to be less than the system's page size, will trigger the panic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to mount a file system on the target system. They would also need to create an EROFS filesystem image with a block size smaller than the system's page size.
