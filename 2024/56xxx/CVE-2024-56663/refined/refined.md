The provided content relates to CVE-2024-56663.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An off-by-one error in the netlink attribute range validation for `NL80211_ATTR_MLO_LINK_ID`. The maximum allowed value for the attribute was incorrectly set to `IEEE80211_MLD_MAX_NUM_LINKS` instead of `IEEE80211_MLD_MAX_NUM_LINKS - 1`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- An off-by-one error in netlink attribute validation, allowing out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A wild memory access, leading to a kernel crash. The provided crash stack shows a KASAN report due to a read of size 6 at an invalid memory address. This can result in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted netlink message with an invalid `NL80211_ATTR_MLO_LINK_ID` that exceeds the allowed range.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the capability to send netlink messages to the kernel, likely requiring local access or control over a relevant network interface.

**Additional Details:**
The fix modifies the `nl80211_policy` to correctly define the upper bound for `NL80211_ATTR_MLO_LINK_ID`, changing it from `IEEE80211_MLD_MAX_NUM_LINKS` to `IEEE80211_MLD_MAX_NUM_LINKS - 1`.
