The provided content relates to CVE-2024-56700.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** An atomicity violation occurs in the `fmc_send_cmd()` function of the `wl128x` driver. This happens when the function is executed concurrently with modifications to the `fmdev->resp_skb` variable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Atomicity Violation:** The code checks for a valid `fmdev->resp_skb` outside of a locked section, and then uses it after a lock, meaning the value can change between the check and use.
-   **Race Condition:**  Multiple threads could access and modify `fmdev->resp_skb` concurrently. Specifically, one thread might be checking `fmdev->resp_skb` while another sets it to NULL.
-   **Null Pointer Dereference:** A non-null `fmdev->resp_skb` might be set to null by another thread after passing a check resulting in a null pointer dereference on `skb->data` if the value becomes null before being used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   The primary impact is a potential null pointer dereference within the `fmc_send_cmd()` function leading to a crash. Specifically, the line `evt_hdr = (void *)skb->data;` at line 478 would trigger the dereference.

**Attack vectors:**
-   The vulnerability can be triggered by any process or thread that uses the wl128x driver and its `fmc_send_cmd()` function. The attacker must be able to trigger the concurrent execution of `fmc_send_cmd()` and another thread modifying `fmdev->resp_skb`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the wl128x driver such that they can cause the race condition to occur between execution of `fmc_send_cmd()` and another function modifying `fmdev->resp_skb`. This likely implies local access to the system or a remote capability exposed by the system.
-   The ability to control the timing to increase likelihood of race condition triggering.

**Additional details:**
-   The vulnerability was discovered using a static analysis tool that identified potential concurrency issues related to locking APIs.
-   The fix involves moving the `fmdev->resp_skb` validity check inside the locked section to ensure the value does not change between the check and its usage.
