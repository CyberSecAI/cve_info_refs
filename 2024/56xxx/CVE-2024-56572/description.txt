In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: platform: allegro-dvt: Fix possible memory leak in allocate_buffers_internal()

The buffer in the loop should be released under the exception path,
otherwise there may be a memory leak here.

To mitigate this, free the buffer when allegro_alloc_buffer fails.
