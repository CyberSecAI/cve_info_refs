{
  "CVE-2024-56548": {
    "Description": "The HFS+ filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel is vulnerable to a use-after-free condition due to changes in device block sizes, particularly with loop devices. When the logical block size of a device changes (e.g., via ioctl LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE), the hfsplus driver may allocate a block using the new size but subsequently use an older size for I/O operations. This can cause out-of-bounds writes during hfsplus_read_wrapper calls to hfsplus_submit_bio.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The hfsplus driver was not consistently using the most recent logical block size of a device, leading to a discrepancy between allocated block size and the size used during I/O operations, particularly when the block size is changed after the filesystem is mounted.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a kernel panic and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by triggering a slab-use-after-free condition, leading to out-of-bounds writes.",
    "Attack vectors": "Mounting an HFS+ filesystem on a loop device, then changing the device's logical block size using ioctl LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to mount filesystems, have access to a loop device and be able to use ioctl calls."
