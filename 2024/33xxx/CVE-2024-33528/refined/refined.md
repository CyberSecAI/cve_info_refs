The provided content contains detailed information about CVE-2024-33528.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient output encoding when displaying object names imported via XML. The application assumes that user interface input validation is strict, but the XML import functionality bypasses those validations, and the output is not encoded for context-specific rendering (HTML), which allows for XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of proper output encoding of object titles when rendered in the user interface.
- Less strict input validation during XML import compared to the user interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with tutor privileges can inject malicious JavaScript payloads into object names by importing a specially crafted XML file.
- When users browse courses, the injected XSS payload executes, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Further compromising the system when combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through importing a malicious XML file, containing a crafted XSS payload within the "Title" tag of an object (e.g., folder, exercise, test).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs tutor privileges in at least one course to import objects.
- The attacker does not need to be an administrator, but an administrator needs to interact with the injected payload in the described exploit chain.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit is triggered when the object's title is browsed, which means that any user who accesses the course will be affected.
- The vulnerability is present in ILIAS versions before v7.30, v8.11 and v9.1.
- This vulnerability was chained with a PHP remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2024-33529) in a multi-step exploit chain.
- The report mentions three additional XSS vulnerabilities discovered through the same vector: CVE-2024-33525, CVE-2024-33526, and CVE-2024-33527.
- The provided document suggests using context-aware output encoding for every variable to prevent XSS.
