- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow in the `httpd` daemon of FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A heap buffer overflow ([CWE-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)) vulnerability exists in the httpd daemon.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code or commands with low privileges by sending specially crafted requests. This could lead to an escalation of privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote unauthenticated attacker sending specifically crafted requests to the httpd daemon.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service. No authentication is required.
