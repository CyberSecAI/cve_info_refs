# aiohttp.web.static(follow\_symlinks=True) is vulnerable to directory traversal

Moderate

[Dreamsorcerer](/Dreamsorcerer)
published
GHSA-5h86-8mv2-jq9f
Jan 29, 2024

## Package

pip

aiohttp
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>1.0.5

## Patched versions

3.9.2

## Description

### Summary

Improperly configuring static resource resolution in aiohttp when used as a web server can result in the unauthorized reading of arbitrary files on the system.

### Details

When using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is necessary to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the option 'follow\_symlinks' can be used to determine whether to follow symbolic links outside the static root directory. When 'follow\_symlinks' is set to True, there is no validation to check if a given file path is within the root directory.This can lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the system, even when symlinks are not present.

i.e. An application is only vulnerable with setup code like:

```
app.router.add_routes([
    web.static("/static", "static/", follow_symlinks=True),  # Remove follow_symlinks to avoid the vulnerability
])

```
### Impact

This is a directory traversal vulnerability with CWE ID 22. When using aiohttp as a web server and enabling static resource resolution with `follow_symlinks` set to True, it can lead to this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been present since the introduction of the `follow_symlinks` parameter.

### Workaround

Even if upgrading to a patched version of aiohttp, we recommend following these steps regardless.

If using `follow_symlinks=True` outside of a restricted local development environment, disable the option immediately. This option is NOT needed to follow symlinks which point to a location *within* the static root directory, it is *only* intended to allow a symlink to break out of the static directory. Even with this CVE fixed, there is still a substantial risk of misconfiguration when using this option on a server that accepts requests from remote users.

Additionally, aiohttp has always recommended using a reverse proxy server (such as nginx) to handle static resources and *not* to use these static resources in aiohttp for production environments. Doing so also protects against this vulnerability, and is why we expect the number of affected users to be very low.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

Security-sensitive parts of the *Python HTTP parser* retained minor
differences in allowable character sets, that must trigger error
handling to robustly match frame boundaries of proxies in order to
protect against injection of additional requests. Additionally,
validation could trigger exceptions that were not handled consistently
with processing of other malformed input.

### Details
These problems are rooted in pattern matching protocol elements,
previously improved by PR #&#8203;3235 and GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg:

1. The expression `HTTP/(\d).(\d)` lacked another backslash to clarify
that the separator should be a literal dot, not just *any* Unicode code
point (result: `HTTP/(\d)\.(\d)`).

2. The HTTP version was permitting Unicode digits, where only ASCII
digits are standards-compliant.

3. Distinct regular expressions for validating HTTP Method and Header
field names were used - though both should (at least) apply the common
restrictions of rfc9110 `token`.

### PoC
`GET / HTTP/1ö1`
`GET / HTTP/1.𝟙`
`GET/: HTTP/1.1`
`Content-Encoding?: chunked`

### Impact
Primarily concerns running an aiohttp server without llhttp:
1. **behind a proxy**: Being more lenient than internet standards
require could, depending on deployment environment, assist in request
smuggling.
2. **directly accessible** or exposed behind proxies relaying malformed
input: the unhandled exception could cause excessive resource
consumption on the application server and/or its logging facilities.

[CVE-2024-23334](https://togithub.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-5h86-8mv2-jq9f)

### Summary
Improperly configuring static resource resolution in aiohttp when used
as a web server can result in the unauthorized reading of arbitrary
files on the system.

### Details
When using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is
necessary to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the
option 'follow_symlinks' can be used to determine whether to follow
symbolic links outside the static root directory. When 'follow_symlinks'
is set to True, there is no validation to check if a given file path is
within the root directory.This can lead to directory traversal
vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on
the system, even when symlinks are not present.

i.e. An application is only vulnerable with setup code like:
```
app.router.add_routes([
    web.static(\"/static\", \"static/\", follow_symlinks=True),  # Remove follow_symlinks to avoid the vulnerability
])
```

### Impact
This is a directory traversal vulnerability with CWE ID 22. When using
aiohttp as a web server and enabling static resource resolution with
`follow_symlinks` set to True, it can lead to this vulnerability. This
vulnerability has been present since the introduction of the
`follow_symlinks` parameter.

### Workaround
Even if upgrading to a patched version of aiohttp, we recommend
following these steps regardless.

If using `follow_symlinks=True` outside of a restricted local
development environment, disable the option immediately. This option is
NOT needed to follow symlinks which point to a location _within_ the
static root directory, it is _only_ intended to allow a symlink to break
out of the static directory. Even with this CVE fixed, there is still a
substantial risk of misconfiguration when using this option on a server
that accepts requests from remote users.

Additionally, aiohttp has always recommended using a reverse proxy
server (such as nginx) to handle static resources and _not_ to use these
static resources in aiohttp for production environments. Doing so also
protects against this vulnerability, and is why we expect the number of
affected users to be very low.

### Summary
Improperly configuring static resource resolution in aiohttp when used
as a web server can result in the unauthorized reading of arbitrary
files on the system.

### Details
When using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is
necessary to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the
option 'follow_symlinks' can be used to determine whether to follow
symbolic links outside the static root directory. When 'follow_symlinks'
is set to True, there is no validation to check if a given file path is
within the root directory.This can lead to directory traversal
vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on
the system, even when symlinks are not present.

i.e. An application is only vulnerable with setup code like:
```
app.router.add_routes([
    web.static("/static", "static/", follow_symlinks=True),  # Remove follow_symlinks to avoid the vulnerability
])
```

### Impact
This is a directory traversal vulnerability with CWE ID 22. When using
aiohttp as a web server and enabling static resource resolution with
`follow_symlinks` set to True, it can lead to this vulnerability. This
vulnerability has been present since the introduction of the
`follow_symlinks` parameter.

### Workaround
Even if upgrading to a patched version of aiohttp, we recommend
following these steps regardless.

If using `follow_symlinks=True` outside of a restricted local
development environment, disable the option immediately. This option is
NOT needed to follow symlinks which point to a location _within_ the
static root directory, it is _only_ intended to allow a symlink to break
out of the static directory. Even with this CVE fixed, there is still a
substantial risk of misconfiguration when using this option on a server
that accepts requests from remote users.

Additionally, aiohttp has always recommended using a reverse proxy
server (such as nginx) to handle static resources and _not_ to use these
static resources in aiohttp for production environments. Doing so also
protects against this vulnerability, and is why we expect the number of
affected users to be very low.

# aiohttp.web.static(follow\_symlinks=True) is vulnerable to directory traversal

Moderate

[Dreamsorcerer](/Dreamsorcerer)
published
GHSA-5h86-8mv2-jq9f
Jan 29, 2024

## Package

pip

aiohttp
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>1.0.5

## Patched versions

3.9.2

## Description

### Summary

Improperly configuring static resource resolution in aiohttp when used as a web server can result in the unauthorized reading of arbitrary files on the system.

### Details

When using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is necessary to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the option 'follow\_symlinks' can be used to determine whether to follow symbolic links outside the static root directory. When 'follow\_symlinks' is set to True, there is no validation to check if a given file path is within the root directory.This can lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the system, even when symlinks are not present.

i.e. An application is only vulnerable with setup code like:

```
app.router.add_routes([
    web.static("/static", "static/", follow_symlinks=True),  # Remove follow_symlinks to avoid the vulnerability
])

```
### Impact

This is a directory traversal vulnerability with CWE ID 22. When using aiohttp as a web server and enabling static resource resolution with `follow_symlinks` set to True, it can lead to this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been present since the introduction of the `follow_symlinks` parameter.

### Workaround

Even if upgrading to a patched version of aiohttp, we recommend following these steps regardless.

If using `follow_symlinks=True` outside of a restricted local development environment, disable the option immediately. This option is NOT needed to follow symlinks which point to a location *within* the static root directory, it is *only* intended to allow a symlink to break out of the static directory. Even with this CVE fixed, there is still a substantial risk of misconfiguration when using this option on a server that accepts requests from remote users.

Additionally, aiohttp has always recommended using a reverse proxy server (such as nginx) to handle static resources and *not* to use these static resources in aiohttp for production environments. Doing so also protects against this vulnerability, and is why we expect the number of affected users to be very low.
