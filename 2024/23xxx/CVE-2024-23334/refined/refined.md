      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the improper validation of file paths when the `follow_symlinks` option is set to `True` in `aiohttp.web.static`. This setting allows the server to follow symbolic links outside the designated static root directory, but lacks proper checks to ensure the resolved path remains within the intended static root. This lack of validation allows directory traversal.",
