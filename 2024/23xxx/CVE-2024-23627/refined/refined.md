- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Command injection vulnerability in the 'SaveStaticRouteIPv4Params' parameter of the Motorola MR2600.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the 'SaveStaticRouteIPv4Params' parameter leading to command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attacker can achieve command execution on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malicious input to the 'SaveStaticRouteIPv4Params' parameter, requiring adjacent network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be on an adjacent network and although authentication is required, it can be bypassed.
