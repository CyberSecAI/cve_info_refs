- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Client-side enforcement of server-side security, specifically related to improper access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from a client-side enforcement of security measures that should be handled server-side, leading to improper access control (CWE-602). An authenticated user with read-only permissions can bypass these controls.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker with read-only privileges can execute sensitive operations by sending crafted requests. This could lead to unauthorized actions and potentially severe consequences.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafting specific requests to the vulnerable system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least read-only permission to exploit this vulnerability.
