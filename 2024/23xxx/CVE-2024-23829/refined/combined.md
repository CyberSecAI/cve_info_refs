# HTTP parser (the python one, not llhttp) still overly lenient about separators

Low

[Dreamsorcerer](/Dreamsorcerer)
published
GHSA-8qpw-xqxj-h4r2
Jan 29, 2024

## Package

pip

aiohttp
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 3.9.1

## Patched versions

3.9.2

## Description

### Summary

Security-sensitive parts of the *Python HTTP parser* retained minor differences in allowable character sets, that must trigger error handling to robustly match frame boundaries of proxies in order to protect against injection of additional requests. Additionally, validation could trigger exceptions that were not handled consistently with processing of other malformed input.

### Details

These problems are rooted in pattern matching protocol elements, previously improved by PR [#3235](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3235) and [GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg "GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg"):

1. The expression `HTTP/(\d).(\d)` lacked another backslash to clarify that the separator should be a literal dot, not just *any* Unicode code point (result: `HTTP/(\d)\.(\d)`).
2. The HTTP version was permitting Unicode digits, where only ASCII digits are standards-compliant.
3. Distinct regular expressions for validating HTTP Method and Header field names were used - though both should (at least) apply the common restrictions of rfc9110 `token`.

### PoC

`GET / HTTP/1ö1`

`GET / HTTP/1.𝟙`

`GET/: HTTP/1.1`

`Content-Encoding?: chunked`

### Impact

Primarily concerns running an aiohttp server without llhttp:

1. **behind a proxy**: Being more lenient than internet standards require could, depending on deployment environment, assist in request smuggling.
2. **directly accessible** or exposed behind proxies relaying malformed input: the unhandled exception could cause excessive resource consumption on the application server and/or its logging facilities.

| Backport to 3.9: 💔 cherry-picking failed — conflicts found ❌ Failed to cleanly apply [33ccdfb](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/33ccdfb0a12690af5bb49bda2319ec0907fa7827) on top of patchback/backports/3.9/33ccdfb0a12690af5bb49bda2319ec0907fa7827/pr-8074 Backporting merged PR [#8074](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8074) into master  1. Ensure you have a local repo clone of your fork. Unless you cloned it    from the upstream, this would be your `origin` remote. 2. Make sure you have an upstream repo added as a remote too. In these    instructions you'll refer to it by the name `upstream`. If you don't    have it, here's how you can add it:    ```    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp.git    ``` 3. Ensure you have the latest copy of upstream and prepare a branch    that will hold the backported code:    ```    $ git fetch upstream    $ git checkout -b patchback/backports/3.9/33ccdfb0a12690af5bb49bda2319ec0907fa7827/pr-8074 upstream/3.9    ``` 4. Now, cherry-pick PR [Improve validation in HTTP parser #8074](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8074) contents into that branch:    ```    $ git cherry-pick -x 33ccdfb0a12690af5bb49bda2319ec0907fa7827    ```        If it'll yell at you with something like `fatal: Commit 33ccdfb0a12690af5bb49bda2319ec0907fa7827 is a merge but no -m option was given.`, add `-m 1` as follows instead:    ```    $ git cherry-pick -m1 -x 33ccdfb0a12690af5bb49bda2319ec0907fa7827    ``` 5. At this point, you'll probably encounter some merge conflicts. You must    resolve them in to preserve the patch from PR [Improve validation in HTTP parser #8074](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8074) as close to the    original as possible. 6. Push this branch to your fork on GitHub:    ```    $ git push origin patchback/backports/3.9/33ccdfb0a12690af5bb49bda2319ec0907fa7827/pr-8074    ``` 7. Create a PR, ensure that the CI is green. If it's not — update it so that    the tests and any other checks pass. This is it!    Now relax and wait for the maintainers to process your pull request    when they have some cycles to do reviews. Don't worry — they'll tell you if    any improvements are necessary when the time comes!   🤖 @patchback I'm built with [octomachinery](https://octomachinery.dev) and my source is open — <https://github.com/sanitizers/patchback-github-app>. |

Hey [@pajod](https://github.com/pajod), could you expand what this comment refers to? Does the `utf8sep` variable contain a value that matches all the listed cases? I'm rather confused. Or did you mean to test different cases but added just one?

Sorry, something went wrong.

That utf8sep has those properties (and LTR), a popular choice for being multiple edge cases in one. None of which are strictly needed for.. *comparing to the literal ASCII dot* as we do here, but some of which I expect to regain relevance on future refactoring.

[@pajod](https://github.com/pajod) FYI it's much cleaner to use the `@pytest.mark.xfail` decorator since it allows pytest to make the decisions earlier in the process.

But that *only* explains why a llhttp-only code coverage report complains!? There is something much more wrong here. Like, *I completely broke that test* levels of wrong.

*Edit:* Sorry, I did. Four times. I meant to acknowledge (in [two cases, expected to be changed](https://github.com/nodejs/llhttp/commit/10ff94eb252e0e7cb792dcde6d40d0e46b794f8a)) behaviour differences of the C parser, while keeping my tests parametrized to keep running both parsers anyway. But each time I copied the `not isinstance(response, HttpResponseParserPy)` line where it should say `not isinstance(parser, HttpRequestParserPy)`. And mypy would have told me, if not for that `Any` and the duplicate use of the `response` identifier (global scope function but also function scope variable)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Yeah, I noticed there was no coverage on these tests for some reason. Something to look at later.

Yep. I started looking into the coverage drop and that's how I noticed this thing.

FWIW we *really* should refactor how the tests with and without extensions are parametrized/generated, like I did in multidict recently. Essentially, there was an import loop in some places in tests that prevented C-extension tests from being executed ([aio-libs/multidict#837](https://github.com/aio-libs/multidict/issues/837) / [aio-libs/multidict#915](https://github.com/aio-libs/multidict/pull/915) / <https://multidict.aio-libs.org/en/latest/changes/#contributor-facing-changes>). So I fixed that by having an explicit global option for requiring one mode or the other, with a collection of fixtures reused everywhere and zero magic around import attempts and handling failures in weird ways.

Another thing I configured is the module classification in Codecov with different expected coverage thresholds — the goal should be that tests get 100% coverage in every CI run (from all jobs combined, of course). And the actual project code coverage should be measured as a separate metric. Currently, a global threshold value allows coverage to drop in tests if it's compensated by coverage in the project, meaning that we may be gaining more dead code (read: tests that are never executed), which results in a false sense of things being tested, when they aren't.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2024-23829](https://togithub.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-8qpw-xqxj-h4r2)

### Summary
Security-sensitive parts of the *Python HTTP parser* retained minor
differences in allowable character sets, that must trigger error
handling to robustly match frame boundaries of proxies in order to
protect against injection of additional requests. Additionally,
validation could trigger exceptions that were not handled consistently
with processing of other malformed input.

### Details
These problems are rooted in pattern matching protocol elements,
previously improved by PR #&#8203;3235 and GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg:

1. The expression `HTTP/(\d).(\d)` lacked another backslash to clarify
that the separator should be a literal dot, not just *any* Unicode code
point (result: `HTTP/(\d)\.(\d)`).

2. The HTTP version was permitting Unicode digits, where only ASCII
digits are standards-compliant.

3. Distinct regular expressions for validating HTTP Method and Header
field names were used - though both should (at least) apply the common
restrictions of rfc9110 `token`.

### PoC
`GET / HTTP/1ö1`
`GET / HTTP/1.𝟙`
`GET/: HTTP/1.1`
`Content-Encoding?: chunked`

### Impact
Primarily concerns running an aiohttp server without llhttp:
1. **behind a proxy**: Being more lenient than internet standards
require could, depending on deployment environment, assist in request
smuggling.
2. **directly accessible** or exposed behind proxies relaying malformed
input: the unhandled exception could cause excessive resource
consumption on the application server and/or its logging facilities.

####
[CVE-2024-23334](https://togithub.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-5h86-8mv2-jq9f)

### Summary
Improperly configuring static resource resolution in aiohttp when used
as a web server can result in the unauthorized reading of arbitrary
files on the system.

### Details
When using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is
necessary to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the
option 'follow_symlinks' can be used to determine whether to follow
symbolic links outside the static root directory. When 'follow_symlinks'
is set to True, there is no validation to check if a given file path is
within the root directory.This can lead to directory traversal
vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on
the system, even when symlinks are not present.

i.e. An application is only vulnerable with setup code like:
```
app.router.add_routes([
    web.static(\"/static\", \"static/\", follow_symlinks=True),  # Remove follow_symlinks to avoid the vulnerability
])
```

### Impact
This is a directory traversal vulnerability with CWE ID 22. When using
aiohttp as a web server and enabling static resource resolution with
`follow_symlinks` set to True, it can lead to this vulnerability. This
vulnerability has been present since the introduction of the
`follow_symlinks` parameter.

### Workaround
Even if upgrading to a patched version of aiohttp, we recommend
following these steps regardless.

If using `follow_symlinks=True` outside of a restricted local
development environment, disable the option immediately. This option is
NOT needed to follow symlinks which point to a location _within_ the
static root directory, it is _only_ intended to allow a symlink to break
out of the static directory. Even with this CVE fixed, there is still a
substantial risk of misconfiguration when using this option on a server
that accepts requests from remote users.

Additionally, aiohttp has always recommended using a reverse proxy
server (such as nginx) to handle static resources and _not_ to use these
static resources in aiohttp for production environments. Doing so also
protects against this vulnerability, and is why we expect the number of
affected users to be very low.

NOT needed to follow symlinks which point to a location _within_ the
static root directory, it is _only_ intended to allow a symlink to break
out of the static directory. Even with this CVE fixed, there is still a
substantial risk of misconfiguration when using this option on a server
that accepts requests from remote users.

Additionally, aiohttp has always recommended using a reverse proxy
server (such as nginx) to handle static resources and _not_ to use these
static resources in aiohttp for production environments. Doing so also
protects against this vulnerability, and is why we expect the number of
affected users to be very low.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[[CVE-2024-23829](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8qpw-xqxj-h4r2 "CVE-2024-23829")](<https://togithub.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-8qpw-xqxj-h4r2>)

### Summary
Security-sensitive parts of the *Python HTTP parser* retained minor
differences in allowable character sets, that must trigger error
handling to robustly match frame boundaries of proxies in order to
protect against injection of additional requests. Additionally,
validation could trigger exceptions that were not handled consistently
with processing of other malformed input.

### Details
These problems are rooted in pattern matching protocol elements,
previously improved by PR #&#8203;3235 and [GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg "GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg"):

1. The expression `HTTP/(\d).(\d)` lacked another backslash to clarify
that the separator should be a literal dot, not just *any* Unicode code
point (result: `HTTP/(\d)\.(\d)`).

2. The HTTP version was permitting Unicode digits, where only ASCII
digits are standards-compliant.

3. Distinct regular expressions for validating HTTP Method and Header
field names were used - though both should (at least) apply the common
restrictions of rfc9110 `token`.

### PoC
`GET / HTTP/1ö1`
`GET / HTTP/1.𝟙`
`GET/: HTTP/1.1`
`Content-Encoding?: chunked`

### Impact
Primarily concerns running an aiohttp server without llhttp:
1. **behind a proxy**: Being more lenient than internet standards
require could, depending on deployment environment, assist in request
smuggling.
2. **directly accessible** or exposed behind proxies relaying malformed
input: the unhandled exception could cause excessive resource
consumption on the application server and/or its logging facilities.

[[CVE-2024-23334](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5h86-8mv2-jq9f "CVE-2024-23334")](<https://togithub.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-5h86-8mv2-jq9f>)

### Summary
Improperly configuring static resource resolution in aiohttp when used
as a web server can result in the unauthorized reading of arbitrary
files on the system.

### Details
When using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static routes, it is
necessary to specify the root path for static files. Additionally, the
option 'follow_symlinks' can be used to determine whether to follow
symbolic links outside the static root directory. When 'follow_symlinks'
is set to True, there is no validation to check if a given file path is
within the root directory.This can lead to directory traversal
vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access to arbitrary files on
the system, even when symlinks are not present.

i.e. An application is only vulnerable with setup code like:
```
app.router.add_routes([
    web.static("/static", "static/", follow_symlinks=True),  # Remove follow_symlinks to avoid the vulnerability
])
```

### Impact
This is a directory traversal vulnerability with CWE ID 22. When using
aiohttp as a web server and enabling static resource resolution with
`follow_symlinks` set to True, it can lead to this vulnerability. This
vulnerability has been present since the introduction of the
`follow_symlinks` parameter.

### Workaround
Even if upgrading to a patched version of aiohttp, we recommend
following these steps regardless.

If using `follow_symlinks=True` outside of a restricted local
development environment, disable the option immediately. This option is
NOT needed to follow symlinks which point to a location _within_ the
static root directory, it is _only_ intended to allow a symlink to break
out of the static directory. Even with this CVE fixed, there is still a
substantial risk of misconfiguration when using this option on a server
that accepts requests from remote users.

Additionally, aiohttp has always recommended using a reverse proxy
server (such as nginx) to handle static resources and _not_ to use these
static resources in aiohttp for production environments. Doing so also
protects against this vulnerability, and is why we expect the number of
affected users to be very low.

# HTTP parser (the python one, not llhttp) still overly lenient about separators

Low

[Dreamsorcerer](/Dreamsorcerer)
published
GHSA-8qpw-xqxj-h4r2
Jan 29, 2024

## Package

pip

aiohttp
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 3.9.1

## Patched versions

3.9.2

## Description

### Summary

Security-sensitive parts of the *Python HTTP parser* retained minor differences in allowable character sets, that must trigger error handling to robustly match frame boundaries of proxies in order to protect against injection of additional requests. Additionally, validation could trigger exceptions that were not handled consistently with processing of other malformed input.

### Details

These problems are rooted in pattern matching protocol elements, previously improved by PR [#3235](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3235) and [GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg "GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg"):

1. The expression `HTTP/(\d).(\d)` lacked another backslash to clarify that the separator should be a literal dot, not just *any* Unicode code point (result: `HTTP/(\d)\.(\d)`).
2. The HTTP version was permitting Unicode digits, where only ASCII digits are standards-compliant.
3. Distinct regular expressions for validating HTTP Method and Header field names were used - though both should (at least) apply the common restrictions of rfc9110 `token`.

### PoC

`GET / HTTP/1ö1`

`GET / HTTP/1.𝟙`

`GET/: HTTP/1.1`

`Content-Encoding?: chunked`

### Impact

Primarily concerns running an aiohttp server without llhttp:

1. **behind a proxy**: Being more lenient than internet standards require could, depending on deployment environment, assist in request smuggling.
2. **directly accessible** or exposed behind proxies relaying malformed input: the unhandled exception could cause excessive resource consumption on the application server and/or its logging facilities.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
