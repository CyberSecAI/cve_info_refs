The provided content is related to CVE-2024-23828.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a bypass of previous fixes (GHSA-pxmr-q2x3-9x9m and GHSA-8r25-68wm-jw35), allowing an attacker to inject data directly into the `app.ini` configuration file via CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) injection. This injection enables modification of the `test_config_cmd` and `start_cmd` values within the configuration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CRLF injection vulnerability allowing modification of critical application configuration values.
- Insufficient input validation or sanitization when processing the values that end up in the `app.ini` file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows for Authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the host system where the affected application is running.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through CRLF injection when setting configuration values.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the nginx-ui application.
- The attacker must be able to inject CRLF characters to manipulate values written to `app.ini`.
