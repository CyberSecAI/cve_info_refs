Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-23387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in FusionPBX.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the application's database or storage, and then executed when a user interacts with the affected data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the web browser of a user logged into FusionPBX. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Defacement of the web interface
    - Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious script into the system, likely via a user input field or other data entry point. The injected script is stored by the application.
- When a user interacts with the stored malicious script, their browser executes the script. This can be when an admin views data that contains the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into a data field that is not properly sanitized.
- According to the JVN analysis, the attacker needs to have a high privilege to inject the script, the victim needs to have user interaction, the scope is changed.
- CVSS v2 lists the required authentication as single user session

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in FusionPBX version 5.1.0, released in July 2023.
- The vulnerability was reported to IPA by Satoshi Horikoshi, and coordinated with the vendor under Information Security Early Warning Partnership.
