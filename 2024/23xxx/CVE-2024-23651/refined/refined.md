Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-23651

**Root Cause:** A race condition exists when accessing subpaths from shared cache mounts. This occurs because the parent mount might not be immutable while the submount is being created.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Race condition
- Inconsistent immutability of parent and sub-mounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Files from the host system become accessible to build containers.
- Malicious actors can potentially gain unauthorized access to host system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Two malicious build steps running in parallel.
- Build steps sharing the same cache mounts with subpaths.
- Exploitation requires the use of the `--mount=type=cache,source=...` option in a Dockerfile.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create or modify Dockerfiles.
- Ability to run two or more build steps in parallel, sharing cache mounts with subpaths.
- Access to an environment that uses a vulnerable version of BuildKit.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is addressed in BuildKit v0.12.5.
- The vulnerability was reported by rmcnamara-snyk.
- The vulnerability was assigned GHSA-m3r6-h7wv-7xxv.
- The fix includes additional validation of submount sources.
- A workaround is provided, advising to avoid using BuildKit frontends from untrusted sources or building untrusted Dockerfiles that use cache mounts.
