# XSS in @apollo/experimental-nextjs-app-support

High

Jan 30, 2024

## Package

npm

@apollo/experimental-nextjs-app-support
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 0.6.0

## Patched versions

0.7.0

## Description

### Impact

The @apollo/experimental-apollo-client-nextjs NPM package is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This vulnerability arises from improper handling of untrusted input when @apollo/experimental-apollo-client-nextjs performs server-side rendering of HTML pages. To fix this vulnerability, we implemented appropriate escaping to prevent javascript injection into rendered pages.

### Patches

To fix this issue, please update to version 0.7.0 or later.

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds for this issue. Please update to version 0.7.0

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2024-23841
