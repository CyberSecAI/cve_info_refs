Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of untrusted input during server-side rendering of HTML pages by the `@apollo/experimental-nextjs-app-support` NPM package. Specifically, the JSON data being injected into the HTML was not properly escaped, allowing for potential JavaScript injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core issue is an XSS vulnerability, where malicious JavaScript can be injected into the rendered HTML page.
- Improper Input Handling: The package failed to sanitize or escape the JSON data before embedding it into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, including stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, modifying the content of the page, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit this remotely.
- Server-Side Rendering: The vulnerability is triggered during server-side rendering when the application processes and embeds JSON data into the HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No specific privileges are required for exploitation.
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to control or manipulate the data that is being rendered by the vulnerable component.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerable versions are `<= 0.6.0` of the `@apollo/experimental-nextjs-app-support` package.
- The fix involves updating to version `0.7.0` or later.
- The fix implemented proper escaping of HTML characters in the JSON string before injecting it into the stream. The commit message describes this with "escape html characters in JSON string before injecting it into stream".
- A new utility `htmlescape.ts` was introduced to handle HTML escaping which was copied from next.js.
- The `transportDataToJS` function in `dataTransport.ts` was modified to use the `htmlEscapeJsonString` function to sanitize the JSON data.
- The severity is rated as High with a CVSS score of 8.2.
