# MailCow-Pixel-Flood-Attack

#### Description:

The application is vulnerable to pixel flood attack, once the payload has been successfully uploaded in the logo the application begans to slow and the admin page doesn't respond.

#### Affected Version: 2023-12a

#### Steps to reproduce:

1. Set up an mailcow-docerized SMTP server.
2. Login to the admin page and navigate to the "customize" functionality.
3. Now change the logo to "lottapixel.jpg" and wait until it gets fully uploaded. Note: It will take some minutes to upload the lottapixel.jpg

[![](/0xbunniee/MailCow-Pixel-Flood-Attack/raw/main/POC-1.png)](/0xbunniee/MailCow-Pixel-Flood-Attack/blob/main/POC-1.png)

[![](/0xbunniee/MailCow-Pixel-Flood-Attack/raw/main/POC-2.png)](/0xbunniee/MailCow-Pixel-Flood-Attack/blob/main/POC-2.png)

[![](/0xbunniee/MailCow-Pixel-Flood-Attack/raw/main/POC-3.png)](/0xbunniee/MailCow-Pixel-Flood-Attack/blob/main/POC-3.png)

4. After the successful upload it can be observed that the mail server will not respond properly and if the server spec is low it will also make the server go down and collapse.
#### PoC:

The admin page becomes unresponsive after the payload is uploaded.

MailCow\_DOS.mp4

#### Impact:

The admin will not be able do anything as the admin page is completely become unresponsive which causes a pandemonium as no one has control over the mail server and can't do anything. As the MailCow is running the services in containers only the admin page is affected and others services like mail(SoGo), etc operates good.

# Pixel flood attack leads to Denial of Service in admin page

Moderate

[DerLinkman](/DerLinkman)
published
GHSA-45rv-3c5p-w4h7
Feb 2, 2024

## Package

mailcow: dockerized

## Affected versions

<= 2023-12b

## Patched versions

>= 2024-01

## Description

The application is vulnerable to pixel flood attack, once the payload has been successfully uploaded in the logo the application goes slow and doesn't respond in the admin page. It is tested on the versions 2023-12a and prior.

**The admin page is the only thing that went unresponsive.**

If the logo is not changed successfully then upload any image and then upload the lottapixel.

### Impact

The admin will not have access to the admin page, where the admin could not do anything which like complete DOS. This can affect the business of the organisation which is using MailCow where the organisation will be facing unavailability and face some internal issues.

### Patches

Patched in Versions >= 2024-01

### Workarounds

Securing your Admin Accounts, Not Uploading unknown Images as your mailcow UI Logo

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
