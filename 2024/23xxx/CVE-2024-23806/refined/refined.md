- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authorization in HID iCLASS SE and OMNIKEY Secure Elements reader configuration cards.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive data, including credential and device administrator keys, can be extracted from the configuration cards due to improper authorization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read the credential and device administration keys from a configuration card. These keys can then be used to create malicious configuration cards or credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the configuration cards is required. An attacker needs to be physically close to or in possession of the cards to communicate with them and extract the sensitive information.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have physical access to the configuration cards and be able to communicate with them using a reader.
