Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-23646:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `downloadAsZipAddFilesAction` method of the `AssetController` within the pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle. This method did not properly sanitize the `selectedIds` parameter, which is used in a SQL query, making it susceptible to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The `selectedIds` parameter, which is expected to contain comma-separated IDs, is directly injected into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL Execution: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `selectedIds` parameter and execute it on the database.
- Data Alteration: The attacker could alter any data within the database.
- Privilege Escalation: An attacker could escalate their privileges to at least admin level.
- Potential for complete compromise: If the database user has sufficient permissions, the attacker could potentially gain full control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attack is performed via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `/admin/asset/download-as-zip-add-files` endpoint.
- Malicious `selectedIds` parameter: The `selectedIds` parameter in the GET request is used to inject the SQL payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Backend Access: The attacker must have at least basic backend user permissions to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- Knowledge of the application: The attacker needs to understand how to send a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- Ability to get CSRF Token: The attacker needs to obtain a valid `X-pimcore-csrf-token` header and the `PHPSESSID` cookie.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions prior to 1.3.2 of the `pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle`.
- The patch was introduced in version 1.3.2, which addresses the issue by quoting the values provided in the `selectedIds` parameter before using them in the SQL query.
- The vulnerability is rated as High Severity.
- The provided PoC demonstrates the SQL Injection by using a `sleep(6)` function, resulting in a delayed response.
