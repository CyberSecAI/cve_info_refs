Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2024-23862:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient encoding of user-controlled inputs, specifically within the `/cupseasylive/grndisplay.php` page with the `grnno` parameter. This lack of proper encoding allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to send a specially crafted URL to an authenticated user. If the user clicks the malicious link, the attacker can steal their session cookie credentials. This could lead to further malicious activities, including gaining unauthorized access to the application or performing actions on behalf of the compromised user.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    * The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the `grnno` parameter on the `/cupseasylive/grndisplay.php` page.
    * An attacker would need to send this crafted URL to a logged-in user.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with XSS payload.
    *   The attacker needs to induce a logged-in user to click the malicious URL.
