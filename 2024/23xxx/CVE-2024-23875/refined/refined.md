The provided content is related to CVE-2024-23875.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is insufficient encoding of user-controlled inputs within the Cups Easy application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically a reflected XSS, as the malicious script is injected through the URL and reflected back in the application's response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to send a specially crafted URL to an authenticated user. If the user clicks the crafted link, the attacker could steal their session cookie credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL that contains malicious JavaScript code. The vulnerable parameter is `issuanceno` in the `/cupseasylive/stockissuancedisplay.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload, and then convince an authenticated user of the Cups Easy application to click on the crafted URL. The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs an existing authenticated user to trigger the vulnerability.
