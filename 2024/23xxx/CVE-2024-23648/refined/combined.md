# Host header injection in the password reset

High

[wisconaut](/wisconaut)
published
GHSA-mrqg-mwh7-q94j
Jan 24, 2024

## Package

admin-ui-classic-bundle
(Pimcore)

## Affected versions

< 1.2.3

## Patched versions

1.2.3

## Description

### Summary

The password reset functionality sends to the the user requesting a password change an email containing an URL to reset its password.

The URL sent contains a unique token, valid during 24 hours, allowing the user to reset its password.

This token is highly sensitive ; as an attacker able to retrieve it would be able to resets the user's password.

It was identified during the audit that the reset-password URL is crafted using the "Host" HTTP header of the request sent to request a password reset.

This way, an external attacker could send password requests for users, but specify a "Host" header of a website that they control.

If the user receiving the mail clicks on the link, the attacker would retrieve the reset token of the victim and perform account takeover.

### Details

This attack required the server to serve Pimcore on arbitrary "Host". This configuration would be plausible if the attacker is already behind the reverse proxy.

During the assessment of my client, their instance was accepting any Host header, and they did not received security recommendations that they should restrict this while installing Pimcore.

From what I understood of Pimcore, the vulnerability is in the "admin-ui-classic-bundle", in the file src/Controller/Admin/UserController.php.

The following screenshots provide evidences of the vulnerability. The environment of the test is : dockerized Pimcore v11.1.1 on default configuration (<https://pimcore.com/docs/platform/Pimcore/Getting_Started/Installation/Docker_Based_Installation/>).

### PoC

### Remediation

Create a variable that sets the server host.

Don't enable password reset functionality while this variable is not set ; or make sure that the administrator knows what they are doing.

I believe that just documenting that the server should not serve on any Host would not be enough to enforce a remediation to this vulnerability.

The Snipe-IT project managed this same issue by creating a "APP\_ALLOW\_INSECURE\_HOSTS" variable, and retrieving the app absolute URL from a config file :<https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/commit/0c4768fd2a11ac26a61814cef23a71061bfd8bcc>

Could lead to a 1-click account takeover

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
