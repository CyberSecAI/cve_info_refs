- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Command injection in the `gena.cgi` module when handling UPnP SUBSCRIBE messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attacker can gain command execution on the device as root.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malicious UPnP SUBSCRIBE message to the vulnerable `gena.cgi` module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable D-Link DAP-1650 device. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
