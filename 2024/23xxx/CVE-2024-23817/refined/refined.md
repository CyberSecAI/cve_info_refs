The provided content is related to CVE-2024-23817.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The Dolibarr application's home page is vulnerable to HTML injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input in an arbitrary parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: HTML injection vulnerability (CWE-80).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML tags into the application's response, which can lead to various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). In the provided example, the attacker was able to comment out parts of the HTML code, which could be used to manipulate the page content and potentially carry out other attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, using a crafted HTTP POST request. The vulnerability is triggered through an arbitrary parameter in the POST body, which is then reflected in the home page's HTML.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the Dolibarr application. No specific privileges are required but user interaction is needed to trigger the exploit, as the user must be logged in.
