# HTML injection vulnerability in Dolibarr Application Home Page

Moderate

[eldy](/eldy)
published
GHSA-7947-48q7-cp5m
Jan 25, 2024

## Package

dolibarr

## Affected versions

18.0.4

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

Observed a HTML Injection vulnerbaility in the Home page of Dolibarr Application. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML tags and manipulate the rendered content in the application's response. Specifically, I was able to successfully inject a new HTML tag into the returned document and, as a result, was able to comment out some part of the Dolibarr App Home page HTML code. This behavior can be exploited to perform various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

### Details

1. Navigate to the login page of Dolibarr application.
2. Submit a login request with the following payload in an arbitrarily supplied body parameter: "**u70ea%22%3e%3c!--HTML\_Injection\_By\_Sai"=1**

**HTTP Post Request:**

POST /dolibarr/index.php?mainmenu=home HTTP/1.1

Host: 192.168.37.129

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:121.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/121.0

Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br

3. Upon successful injection of the payload, some part of Home page HTML code was commented out.

**POC**

Kindly go through the below video for detailed steps:

Dolibarr\_HTML\_Injection.mp4

**Remediation Suggestion**

Kindly validate and sanitize all user-supplied input, especially within HTML attributes, to prevent HTML injection attacks.

Implement proper output encoding when rendering user-provided data to ensure it is treated as plain text rather than executable HTML.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
