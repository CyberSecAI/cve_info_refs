9.0.6

## Description

### Summary

The value of `nvdApiKey` configuration parameter is logged in clear text in debug mode.

### Details

The NVD API key is a kind of secret and should be treated like other secrets when logging in debug mode.

Expecting the same behavior as for several password configurations: just print `******`

Note that while the NVD API Key is an access token for the NVD API - they are not that sensitive. The only thing an NVD API Token grants is a higher rate limit when making calls to publicly available data. The data available from the NVD API is the same whether you have an API Key or not.

### Regarding Maven Configuration

Per standard maven debug logging (e.g. `mvn package -X`) the configuration options are displayed - including credentials, API keys, etc. Per Maven's documentation, the server ID configuration options should be used to store sensitive data: <https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html>

### PoC

The nvdApiKey is configured to use an environment variable; when running `mvn -X dependency-check:check` the clear value is logged twice.

### Impact

The NVD API key is a kind of secret and should not be exposed. If stolen, an attacker can use this key to obtain already public information.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
