Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `nvdApiKey` configuration parameter is logged in clear text when debug mode is enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insertion of sensitive information (NVD API key) into log files.
-  CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains access to the debug logs could potentially steal the NVD API key.
- Although the NVD API key does not grant access to sensitive data (as the data is publicly available), it does grant a higher rate limit when making calls to the NVD API, which may be abused.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the system where the application is running and debug logs are generated.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the machine or the log files generated by the vulnerable application.
- Low privileges are required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `org.owasp:dependency-check-maven`, `org.owasp:dependency-check-cli`, and `org.owasp:dependency-check-ant` versions ranging from 9.0.0 up to 9.0.5 (9.0.6 for maven).
- The vulnerability is triggered when the application is run in debug mode.
- The PoC involves configuring `nvdApiKey` using an environment variable. When running `mvn -X dependency-check:check`, the clear value is logged twice.
- The issue is that the API key should be masked in logs (like password fields), rather than printing it in clear text.
- It should be noted that Maven by default logs the configuration parameters in clear text (including credentials, api keys, etc) when debug logging is enabled.
