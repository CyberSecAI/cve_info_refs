The provided content describes a vulnerability in the MetaGPT project, specifically related to the `QaEngineer` role.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `QaEngineer` role uses a `RunCode` action to test code generated by the `Engineer`.
- The `RunCode.run_script()` method uses `subprocess.Popen` without any input sanitization or security checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:**  The lack of input validation on the code to be executed allows for arbitrary code execution.
- **Unrestricted command execution:** The `subprocess.Popen` call allows for execution of shell commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote command execution:** Attackers can manipulate prompts to execute arbitrary shell commands.
- **System compromise:** Attackers can perform sensitive operations such as file deletion and opening backdoors on the system where MetaGPT is running.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Prompt injection:** Attackers manipulate user prompts to inject malicious commands into the code that is then executed by the `QaEngineer` role.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the prompts provided to the MetaGPT system.
- No specific system access or privileges are needed beyond interaction with the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The reporter provides proof-of-concept code demonstrating the vulnerability.
- They suggest using Docker for sandboxing or implementing command whitelists or blacklists to mitigate the risk, referencing similar approaches used by AutoGPT, AutoGen, LlamaIndex and Pandas-ai
- Project maintainers acknowledge the issue and are considering the suggestions.
