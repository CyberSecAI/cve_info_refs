Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-23747:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the Moderna Sistemas ModernaNet Hospital Management System 2024.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The system directly uses user-supplied IDs to access medical records without proper authorization checks. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `/Modernanet/LAUDO/LAU0000100/Laudo?id=NUMBER` URL is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized access to sensitive medical information:** An attacker can access medical records by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL. This could lead to breaches of privacy and confidentiality of patient data.
*   **Potential access to user accounts:** Weak credentials were also accessible due to the IDOR vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct URL manipulation:** The attacker directly modifies the `id` parameter within the URL: `http://IP/Modernanet/LAUDO/LAU0000100/Laudo?id=NUMBER`
*   By incrementing/decrementing the `id` parameter the attacker can access different user data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable URL structure:** The attacker needs to know or guess the URL pattern used to access medical records.
*   **No authentication needed to view the results**

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability allows access to sensitive medical information without requiring login credentials.
*   The report mentions that weak user account credentials can be obtained via the IDOR, suggesting the IDOR vulnerability can lead to additional security issues beyond medical records.
*   The PoC provided shows how an attacker can access medical information by manipulating the 'id' parameter in the URL.
