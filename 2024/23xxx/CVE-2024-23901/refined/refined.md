The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins and its plugins. Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2024-23901:

**CVE-2024-23901**

*   **Root Cause:** The GitLab Branch Source Plugin unconditionally discovers projects that are shared with the configured owner group. This occurs because the plugin does not check the origin of the project and automatically adds it.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Unconditional discovery of shared projects.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can configure and share a malicious project with the configured owner group, which will then be built by Jenkins after the next scan of the group's projects. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins server via a crafted pipeline definition.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs to have access to GitLab and be able to create projects and share them with the configured owner group used in the GitLab Branch Source plugin configuration in Jenkins. Once the project is shared, Jenkins will automatically add it for a build.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a project in Gitlab and share it with a group that is configured as a project owner in the Jenkins GitLab Branch Source plugin. User interaction is needed as the build is triggered by the next scan of the group's projects.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is present in GitLab Branch Source Plugin versions 684.vea\_fa\_7c1e2fe3 and earlier.
*   The fix is included in version 688.v5fa\_356ee8520, where the default behavior is changed to not discover shared projects. A new trait "Discover shared projects" has been introduced to allow discovering shared projects.
*   After updating, any shared project that has already been discovered will be removed unless the new trait is added to the organization folder configuration before running a scan.
