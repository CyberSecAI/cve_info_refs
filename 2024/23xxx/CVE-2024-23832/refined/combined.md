# Remote user impersonation and takeover

Critical

[Gargron](/Gargron)
published
GHSA-3fjr-858r-92rw
Feb 1, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

all

## Patched versions

3.5.17, 4.0.13, 4.1.13, 4.2.5

## Description

### Summary

Due to a gap in validation of federated content in the affected Mastodon versions, attackers can craft payloads that impersonate remote ActivityPub actors (federated accounts) as-seen-from the affected server.

Every Mastodon version prior to 3.5.17 is vulnerable, as well as 4.0.x versions prior to 4.0.13, 4.1.x version prior to 4.1.13, and 4.2.x versions prior to 4.2.5.

### Details

In some code paths, vulnerable versions of Mastodon would not correctly check the `id` property of remote ActivityPub objects such as posts and accounts.

Indeed, while Mastodon normally ensures that the `id` property of every fetched object correctly reflects the URL of the object, code paths involving `FetchRemoteResource` passed down the `id` property of the fetched object instead of the queried URL:

[mastodon/app/services/fetch\_resource\_service.rb](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/8c183a98310fa74d89573d3920931d9f88cb7e6e/app/services/fetch_resource_service.rb#L48-L51)

Lines 48 to 51
in
[8c183a9](/mastodon/mastodon/commit/8c183a98310fa74d89573d3920931d9f88cb7e6e)

|  | body = response.body\_with\_limit |
| --- | --- |
|  | json = body\_to\_json(body) |
|  |  |
|  | [json['id'], { prefetched\_body: body, id: true }] if supported\_context?(json) && (equals\_or\_includes\_any?(json['type'], ActivityPub::FetchRemoteActorService::SUPPORTED\_TYPES) || expected\_type?(json)) |

This resulted in an incorrect comparison when ingesting the remote object, always trusting the fetched object's self-reported `id` property regardless of where the object was actually located.

### Impact

This vulnerability allowed attackers to impersonate any remote ActivityPub actor as observed from a vulnerable Mastodon server, even if the remote server did not use Mastodon. This vulnerability could also be used to overwrite existing objects, including protocol details, allowing attackers to intercept further trafic between a vulnerable Mastodon server and an impersonated remote ActivityPub actor.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Subject: CVE-2024-23832: Mastodon: Remote user impersonation and takeover

The Mastodon project [1] has published a Github advisory for a
high-severity issue which allows user impersonation and account
takeover with the identifier CVE-2024-23832. The team's Fediverse
postings indicate that everyone should urgently update their
instances. CVSS 3.1 is given as 9.4/10.

The advisory at
<<https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/security/advisories/GHSA-3fjr-858r-92rw>>
states:

  Due to insufficient origin validation in all Mastodon, attackers can
  impersonate and take over any remote account.

  Every Mastodon version prior to 3.5.17 is vulnerable, as well as 4.0.x
  versions prior to 4.0.13, 4.1.x version prior to 4.1.13, and 4.2.x
  versions prior to 4.2.5.

Details are not currently posted, but an update on Feb 15 is
promised. Commit
<<https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/commit/a6641f828b9e6f5806be01754318279c2532ae82>>
appears to be the fix.
