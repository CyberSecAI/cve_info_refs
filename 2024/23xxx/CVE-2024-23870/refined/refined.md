The provided content is related to CVE-2024-23870.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is insufficient encoding of user-controlled inputs in the Cups Easy (Purchase & Inventory) software, version 1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability present is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability exists due to the software not properly sanitizing user-supplied input before displaying it on the webpage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability allows a remote attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application through various parameters. By sending a crafted URL to an authenticated user, an attacker could steal their session cookie credentials and potentially gain unauthorized access to the application and perform malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted URL containing malicious script in the `delete` parameter of the `/cupseasylive/stockissuancelist.php` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick an authenticated user into clicking it. The attacker does not require any prior access to the system, but needs to convince a user to visit the malicious link.
