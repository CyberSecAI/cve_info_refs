- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An arbitrary firmware upload vulnerability exists in the Motorola MR2600.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The device allows arbitrary firmware uploads.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to code execution on the device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A) meaning an attacker needs to be on the same local network as the target device, and the attack complexity is low (AC:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the device and, although authentication is required, it can be bypassed.
