**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Shortcuts application. Specifically, a shortcut could use sensitive data with certain actions without prompting the user for consent. This indicates a flaw in permission checks for specific actions within the Shortcuts app.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient permissions checks. The application doesn't properly validate if the shortcut is allowed to access and use sensitive data before performing certain actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious shortcut could access and utilize sensitive user data without user awareness or consent, violating user privacy and potentially leading to further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious actor would create a shortcut that leverages the vulnerability by using specific actions with sensitive data. The attacker would need to trick the user into running the malicious shortcut.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious shortcut.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to install and run the malicious shortcut.
- The attacker does not require any special position (e.g., being on the same network as the victim) or elevated privileges, assuming that the user has the ability to install and run shortcuts.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in macOS Sonoma 14.3, macOS Ventura 13.6.5, iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3.
- The vulnerability was addressed by implementing additional permissions checks.
- The issue was reported by an anonymous researcher.
