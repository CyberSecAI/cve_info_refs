- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected products use a hard-coded secret value for the computation of a Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can gain full administrative access to the application.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the affected application. No authentication is needed.
