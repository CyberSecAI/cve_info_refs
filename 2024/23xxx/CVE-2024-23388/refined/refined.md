- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "Mercari" App for Android does not properly restrict access to its custom URL scheme function, allowing it to access arbitrary websites.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounded Context ([CWE-939](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/939.html)). Specifically, the app doesn't properly validate/restrict URLs accessed through its custom URL scheme.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can trick a user into accessing an arbitrary website through the vulnerable app. This can lead to phishing attacks where the user might unknowingly disclose sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker leverages the vulnerable application by crafting a malicious URL using the app's custom URL scheme and tricking a user into accessing it, potentially through methods like social engineering or malicious links.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a user to click on the link that will then be processed by the vulnerable app. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target device.
