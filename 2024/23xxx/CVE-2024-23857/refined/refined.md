- **Root cause of vulnerability**: User-controlled inputs are not sufficiently encoded in the `/cupseasylive/grnlinecreate.php` page, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could send a specially crafted URL to an authenticated user, potentially leading to the theft of their session cookie credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and entice an authenticated user to click on it.
