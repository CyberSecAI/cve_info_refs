### Commits on Dec 6, 2022

1. [Custom headers with the CLI option](/emikulic/darkhttpd/commit/defc1e8ce923e5e1463c35f8a260eea94507f4e6) `[--header](/emikulic/darkhttpd/commit/defc1e8ce923e5e1463c35f8a260eea94507f4e6)` [(](/emikulic/darkhttpd/commit/defc1e8ce923e5e1463c35f8a260eea94507f4e6)[#28](https://github.com/emikulic/darkhttpd/pull/28)[)](/emikulic/darkhttpd/commit/defc1e8ce923e5e1463c35f8a260eea94507f4e6)
    …

   ```
   These changes add a command-line option --header, e.g. --header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'.

   Basic tests are included for this option.

   When accepting the argument, a very simple sanitization is made, the string is required to contain ": ", and can’t contain a '\n' character. These checks are far from what is required to truly validate a HTTP header, but will at least detect simple mistakes and forbid the abuse of having arguments that include more than one header, or, worse, that include a body for the response (after "\r\n\r\n").

   This should also close the Issue [#16](https://github.com/emikulic/darkhttpd/issues/16) and PR [#27](https://github.com/emikulic/darkhttpd/pull/27), I think, since CORS functionality can be obtained by specifying a custom header.

Arrived here from [an advisory on oss-sec](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/23/2). You might want to consider wiping the relevant `argv` string on startup to prevent it being visible in `ps`. There’s an inherent race condition in this, so it’s not a perfect defence, but some software like [MySQL believe it is worthwhile](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/blob/824e2b4064053f7daf17d7f3f84b7a3ed92e5fb4/client/mysql_secure_installation.cc#L146-L153).

Sorry, something went wrong.

That's kinda neat. That specific approach appears to leak the length...

Doesn’t it only leak a 1-bit signal of whether your password was 0-length or not? The last line of the selected section terminates the overwritten string early. And if your password is the empty string, I think you have bigger problems than it being visible in `ps`.
