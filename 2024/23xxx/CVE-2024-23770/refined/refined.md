Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-23770:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that when the `--auth` option is used to enable basic authentication in `darkhttpd`, the provided username and password are passed as command-line arguments. These arguments are visible in the process list (e.g., via `ps` command) to other users on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Exposure of sensitive information (username and password)
- Lack of secure handling of authentication credentials

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with local access to the system can view the process list and potentially obtain the username and password used for basic authentication, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the system where darkhttpd is running.
- Viewing the process list using tools like `ps`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to view the process list of running processes.
- The darkhttpd server must be running with the `--auth` option.

**Additional Details:**
- The commit `2b339828b2a42a5fda105ea84934957a7d23e35d` documents that the `--auth` option is not secure and explains that passwords are sent unencrypted over HTTP, and are visible in `ps(1)`.
- A comment on the commit suggests that the `argv` string should be wiped on startup to mitigate the issue, but there are concerns about the length of the password still being leaked. This was later clarified that only a 1-bit signal is leaked, regarding 0 length or not.
