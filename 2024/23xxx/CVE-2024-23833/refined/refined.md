Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the way OpenRefine constructs the JDBC URL for MySQL connections. Specifically, it directly concatenates the user-provided host information without proper sanitization, allowing injection of malicious parameters within the host string. This bypasses a previous fix for `CVE-2023-41887`.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `DatabaseConfiguration#setDatabaseHost` method does not properly validate the input for the database host, allowing the injection of additional parameters into the connection string.
    *   **Direct String Concatenation:** The application directly concatenates user-provided host information into the JDBC URL without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **File Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive files on the target server. While the original remote code execution via deserialization is not achievable due to a newer MySQL driver, the attacker can still read local files by manipulating the JDBC URL.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is network-based, specifically through the JDBC connection functionality of OpenRefine. An attacker can provide a malicious host string through the user interface when configuring a database connection.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to configure a database connection within OpenRefine. This implies that the attacker has some form of access to an OpenRefine instance.
    *   The attacker needs to control a malicious MySQL server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through the `com.google.refine.extension.database.mysql.MySQLConnectionManager#getConnection` method.
*   The `toURI` method call is used to construct the JDBC URL. However the Host part is concatenated directly without validation.
*   The attacker bypasses previous sanitization attempts by using MySQL specific syntax to include parameters directly in the host field.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability, using a specially crafted host string such as `127.0.0.1:3306,(host=127.0.0.1,port=3306,autoDeserialize=true,allowLoadLocalInfile=true,allowUrlInLocalInfile=true,allowLoadLocalInfileInPath=true),127.0.0.1`

**Patch Information**

*   The vulnerability is patched in version 3.7.8.
*   The patch introduces checks in `DatabaseConfiguration#setDatabaseHost` to prevent setting settings inside the host parameter by throwing an exception if parenthesis or equal signs are present in the host string.
*   A unit test was created (`DatabaseConfigurationTest.java`) to ensure this check is working.

**CVSS Score:**

*   The provided CVSS score is 7.3 (High) with the following vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that while the original RCE is no longer achievable, sensitive file reading is still possible due to MySQL's `allowLoadLocalInfile` capability.
*  The vulnerability is a bypass of a previous fix for CVE-2023-41887.
