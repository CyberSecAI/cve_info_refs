# OpenRefine JDBC Attack Vulnerability

High

[wetneb](/wetneb)
published
GHSA-6p92-qfqf-qwx4
Feb 11, 2024

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<=3.7.7

## Patched versions

3.7.8

## Description

### Summary

A jdbc attack vulnerability exists in OpenRefine(version<=3.7.7)

### Details

#### Vulnerability Recurrence

Start by constructing a malicious MySQL Server (using the open source project MySQL\_Fake\_Server here).

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31120718/296241211-96c6a647-8572-4859-837d-dac3d3f52ab0.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31120718/296241211-96c6a647-8572-4859-837d-dac3d3f52ab0.png)

Then go to the Jdbc connection trigger vulnerability

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31120718/296241309-af2c404d-0651-4d4b-86d6-8111cef0295b.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31120718/296241309-af2c404d-0651-4d4b-86d6-8111cef0295b.png)

#### Vulnerability Analysis

This vulnerability is the bypass of `CVE-2023-41887` vulnerability repair, the main vulnerability principle is actually the use of official syntax features, as shown in the following figure, when the connection we can perform parameter configuration in the Host part

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31120718/296241439-db45840c-e3bd-4047-b1ac-499f7aeb4848.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31120718/296241439-db45840c-e3bd-4047-b1ac-499f7aeb4848.png)

In `com.google.refine.extension.database.mysql.MySQLConnectionManager#getConnection` method in the final JdbcUrl structure

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31120718/296241473-fc63b0a9-6ecf-47a0-ac7d-d68d833c7c27.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31120718/296241473-fc63b0a9-6ecf-47a0-ac7d-d68d833c7c27.png)

That is, in the  `toURI` method call here, you can see that the Host part is directly concatenated for any verification, which can be bypassed using the address feature of mysql

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31120718/296241511-e27ba08c-500a-4ed5-b662-96e5e4a8af5f.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31120718/296241511-e27ba08c-500a-4ed5-b662-96e5e4a8af5f.png)

### PoC

*Complete instructions, including specific configuration details, to reproduce the vulnerability.*

```
Type: MySQL
Host: 127.0.0.1:3306,(host=127.0.0.1,port=3306,autoDeserialize=true,allowLoadLocalInfile=true,allowUrlInLocalInfile=true,allowLoadLocalInfileInPath=true),127.0.0.1
Port: 3306
User: win_hosts
Database: test

```
### Impact

Due to the newer MySQL driver library in the latest version of OpenRefine (8.0.30), there is no associated deserialization utilization point, so original code execution cannot be achieved, but attackers can use this vulnerability to read sensitive files on the target server.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
