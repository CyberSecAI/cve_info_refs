# Can't handle "double dots" in URL

Moderate

[yusukebe](/yusukebe)
published
GHSA-rjq5-w47x-x359
Jan 21, 2024

## Package

npm

@hono/node-server
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=1.3.0 <1.4.1

## Patched versions

1.4.1

## Description

### Impact

Since v1.3.0, we use our own Request object. This is great, but the `url` behavior is unexpected.

In the standard API, if the URL contains `..`, here called "double dots", the URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path.

```
const req = new Request('http://localhost/static/../foo.txt') // Web-standards
console.log(req.url) // http://localhost/foo.txt
```

However, the `url` in our Request does not resolve double dots, so `http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt` is returned.

```
const req = new Request('http://localhost/static/../foo.txt')
console.log(req.url) // http://localhost/static/../foo.txt
```

It will pass unresolved paths to the web application. This causes vulnerabilities like [#123](https://github.com/honojs/node-server/issues/123) when using `serveStatic`.

Note: Modern web browsers and a latest `curl` command resolve double dots on the client side, so it does not affect you if the user uses them. However, problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them.

### Patches

"v1.4.1" includes the change to fix this issue.

### Workarounds

Don't use `serveStatic`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
