# ParseXLSX security vulnerbilities

> TL;DR: memory utilization go brrrr

## DoS via out-of-memory bugs

### Analysis

ParseXLSX also handles with merged cells, but the memoize implementation allows attacker to allocate an arbitrary memory size.

```
# ParseXLSX.pm
sub _parse_sheet {
    my $sheet_xml = $self->_new_twig(
        twig_roots => {
            #...
            's:mergeCells/s:mergeCell' => sub {
                my ( $twig, $merge_area ) = @_;

                if (my $ref = $merge_area->att('ref')) {
                    my ($topleft, $bottomright) = $ref =~ /([^:]+):([^:]+)/;

                    # Parse cell coordinates to numeric
                    my ($toprow, $leftcol)     = $self->_cell_to_row_col($topleft);
                    my ($bottomrow, $rightcol) = $self->_cell_to_row_col($bottomright);

                    push @{ $sheet->{MergedArea} }, [
                        $toprow, $leftcol,
                        $bottomrow, $rightcol,
                    ];

                    # Saves merged state for each cell in the merged cell
                    for my $row ($toprow .. $bottomrow) {
                        for my $col ($leftcol .. $rightcol) {
                            $merged_cells{"$row;$col"} = 1;
                        }
                    }
                }

                $twig->purge;
            },
        }
    )
}

sub _cell_to_row_col {
    my $self = shift;
    my ($cell) = @_;

    my ($col, $row) = $cell =~ /([A-Z]+)([0-9]+)/;

    my $ncol = 0;
    for my $char (split //, $col) {
        $ncol *= 26;
        $ncol += ord($char) - ord('A') + 1;
    }
    $ncol = $ncol - 1;

    my $nrow = $row - 1;

    return ($nrow, $ncol);
}
```

Because the size of a merged cell doesn't have any constraints, this can make the program allocates huge amount of memory, exhausts swap memory and crashes the server.

### Final POC

In `xl/worksheets/sheet1.xml`, add

```
  <mergeCells count="1">
    <mergeCell ref="A1:ZZZZ9999"/>
  </mergeCells>
```

inside `<worksheet>` tag, or modify `ref` attribute of any existing `<mergeCell>` tag.

This would make the program allocates at least $26^3 . 10^4 \approx 4.5 . 10^9$ bytes just for handling merged cells.

### Mitigation

I think that this vulnerability can be fixed in either 2 ways:

* Set a limit in range inside `_cell_to_row_col` subroutine
* Use a different method to handle merged cells, instead of preemptively marking like the current solution.

# Vulnerable Spreadsheet Parsing modules

Feb 10, 2024
• Timothy Legge

Between Dec 2023 and Jan 2024, vulnerabilities in Spreadsheet::ParseExcel and Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX were reported to the CPAN Security Group (CPANSec).
This document describes the timeline and analysis of events.

### CVE-2023-7101: Spreadsheet::ParseExcel arbitrary code execution vulnerability

Đình Hải Lê discovered an arbitrary code execution (ACE) vulnerability in the Perl module Spreadsheet::ParseExcel, version 0.65 and earlier.
An attacker, exploiting this vulnerability, would craft an Excel file containing malicious code encoded as a number format string, which is executed when the file is parsed by Spreadsheet::ParseExcel.
Basically, untrusted data is passed to the Perl `eval` function enabling arbitrary code execution.

A detailed write up of the vulnerability and Proof of Concept (PoC) is available at <https://github.com/haile01/perl_spreadsheet_excel_rce_poc>

It was allegedly used by UNC4841, a China-backed threat actor, to compromise Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances, and is considered a root cause for CVE-2023-7102.
(<https://www.barracuda.com/company/legal/esg-vulnerability>)

### CVE-2024-22368: Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX denial of service vulnerability

Đình Hải Lê discovered a DoS vulnerability in Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX, version 0.27 and earlier, enabling denial of service attacks via out-of-memory bugs when parsing a crafted XLSX file.

Basically, an attacker could create a spreadsheet file and set a merged cell to include all possible cells in the spreadsheet.
Because of the way vulnerable versions of Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX parsed the file, it would allocate huge amounts of ram to track the merged cell.
Simply uploading a simple spreadsheet to a web application using the vulnerable module would cause a denial of service as all memory on the server was used.

A detailed write up of the vulnerability and PoC is available at <https://github.com/haile01/perl_spreadsheet_excel_rce_poc/blob/main/parse_xlsx_bomb.md>.

It is not known whether this vulnerability was used to cause a denial of service on a production server.

### CVE-2024-23525: Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX XML external entity attack vulnerability

An Pham discovered a XML external entity injection (XXE) vulnerability in Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX version 0.29 and earlier, enabling an attacker to interact with the system

This is a classic XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerability, in which the attacker can cause the vulnerable code to include data (or a file) that should not be available, by simply instructing the XML parser to load external data.
The PoC also includes an example that would cause a DoS.

Configuring an XML parser to allow loading external entities is dangerous and should never be the default.

A detailed write up of the vulnerability and PoC is available at [https://gist.github.com/phvietan/d1c95a88ab6e17047b0248d6bf9eac4a](https://github.com/haile01/perl_spreadsheet_excel_rce_poc/blob/main/parse_xlsx_bomb.md).

## Timeline

### October 2022 to November 2023

On October 23rd, Đình Hải Lê (<https://github.com/haile01>) started to investigate the Spreadsheet::ParseExcel module after noticing that `eval` was called in the source code.

On October 26th, Đình Hải Lê was able to successfully create a PoC for both the Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) vulnerability in Spreadsheet::ParseExcel (CVE-2023-7101) and the out-of-memory Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX (CVE-2024-22368).

On November 17th, Đình Hải Lê attempted to contact the last maintainer to release a version of Spreadsheet::ParseExcel regarding the ACE vulnerability and attempted to contact the author of Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX regarding the out-of-memory DoS vulnerability.

Unfortunately neither contact attempt succeeded.

On March 15th, the Initial PoC was published on Github by Đình Hải Lê.

On June 20th, Đình Hải Lê submitted both bugs to huntr.com.
huntr.com supports an open source vulnerability disclosure program, where any member of the public can report vulnerabilities found in repositories on GitHub.com.
huntr follows a responsible disclosure program as documented at <https://huntr.com/guidelines/>.

On June 21st, the PoC published by Đình Hải Lê was referenced by a huntr.com representative in an issue logged in two Github repositories (Spreadsheet::ParseExcel and Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX) as:

* <https://github.com/doy/spreadsheet-parsexlsx/issues/103>
* <https://github.com/jmcnamara/spreadsheet-parseexcel/issues/7>

Unfortunately, there is no indication that the owners of either the Spreadsheet::ParseExcel git repository or the Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX git repository saw either of the issues.

In addition, there were no issues logged at <https://github.com/runrig/spreadsheet-parseexcel>, which was the GitHub repository referenced in version 0.65 of the Spreadsheet::ParseExcel module on MetaCPAN, nor were any issues logged on Request Tracker, the traditional issue tracker for Perl modules, <https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=Spreadsheet-ParseExcel> or <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Spreadsheet-ParseXLSX>.

### December 2023

> At some point between the time CVE-2023-7101 was discovered, and the time it was fixed, malicious threat actors used the vulnerability to compromise an undisclosed number of Barracuda Email Security Gateways.
> At this time no one has provided the exact timing of the compromise.

On December 21st, Barracuda pushed patches to all Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) appliances to fix CVE-2023-7102.

On December 22nd, Barracuda pushed patches to previously compromised ESGs (<https://www.barracuda.com/company/legal/esg-vulnerability>).

On December 24th, Mandiant (a Google owned Incident Response company) issued CVE-2023-7101 and published a related disclosure, MNDT-2023-0019 (<https://github.com/mandiant/Vulnerability-Disclosures/blame/master/2023/MNDT-2023-0019.md>).

On December 27th, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) emailed all prior maintainers of the Spreadsheet::ParseExcel module.

On December 28th, the CISA forwarded the email to the CPAN Security Group mailing list.
CPANSec then took the following steps during the next 24 hours:

* CPANSec reached out to a former maintainer, John McNamara, who still had primary permissions (FIRSTCOME) which would allow him to release an updated version.
* McNamara released version Spreadsheet::ParseExcel 0.66 which included a patch provided by Daniel Ruoso (<https://github.com/ruoso>) that resolved the issue.
* CPANSec notified the `oss-security` mailing list, and downstream distributions like Alpine Linux, Arch Linux, NixOS and Debian.
  Note that Debian already had a patch on the way when we reached out.

### January 2024

On January 2nd, Michael Daum released version Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX version 0.28 with fixes for the DoS vulnerability CVE-2024-22368.
The CPANSec requests a CVE identifier from MITRE.

On January 9th, MITRE publishes their analysis of CVE-2024-22368

On January 10th, CPANSec notifies the oss-security mailing list

On January 17th, Michael Daum released another update to Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX version 0.30 with fixes for a XXE attack vulnerability.
CPANSec requests a CVE identifier.
CVE-2024-23525 was issued on January 17th, 2024 for the XXE vulnerability.

On January 18th, CPANSec notifies oss-security mailing list and Michael Daum released Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX version 0.31 which referenced CVE-2024-23525 which had been fixed in version 0.30.

## Responsible Disclosure

Based on the information provided by Đình Hải Lê, and publicly available information, it appears that Đình Hải Lê and/or other parties followed a responsible disclosure process.
Attempts to contact the previous maintainers were followed by a reasonable waiting period before the PoC was published.
After the PoC was published huntr.com also attempted to contact the previous maintainers.

## Resolution

After CVE-2023-7101 was issued, a patch to fix the vulnerability was written by Daniel Ruoso (<https://github.com/ruoso>) and submitted as a pull request to the GitHub repository.
Often, in the case of modules with absent or unresponsive maintainers (Appendix A), a patch could languish requiring a user to apply the patch manually.
However, in this case the CPANSec asked the module’s FIRSTCOME (appendix A) author John McNamara (JMCNAMARA) to release a patched version.
JMCNAMARA had been copied on the notification by CISA and was engaged in the conversation making the resolution faster than in might have otherwise been.

The DoS vulnerability in Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX (CVE-2024-22368) was patched by Michael Daum (NUDDLEGG).
Daum was made the new owner after contacting the previous module owner (DOY) and volunteering to maintain the module.
Daum released version 0.28 on January 2nd, 2024 to resolve the issue.

The XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerability in Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX (CVE-2024-23525) was patched by Michael Daum and version 0.30 was released on January 17th, 2024 to resolve the issue and a final version 0.31 to reference the CVE number on January 18th, 2024.

## Appendix A

### CPAN

The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) is the world’s oldest Open Source language ecosystem and publishing platform.
Having existed since 1995, it has seen and been part of the massive success of the Internet.
It is used today by developers and businesses globally, with more than 14000 developers publishing their Open Source components on CPAN.

### CPAN Security Group

The CPAN Security Group (CPANSec) is a newly formed group stemming from the Perl Toolchain community.
One of its goals is to attempt to facilitate the resolution of security issues with CPAN modules.
Depending on whether the maintainer is active or not, this can be a simple matter of reaching out to a maintainer.
In other cases, it may take considerable time to either contact the maintainer or work with Pause to grant COMAINT to another maintainer.

Regardless, the goal is to have vulnerabilities resolved quickly.
To that end, the CPANSec is attempting to increase its profile so that reporters of security vulnerabilities are able to reach someone who can help, even if the maintainer is not responsive.

CPANSec can be found at <https://security.metacpan.org/>.

### CPAN Module Maintainers

#### FIRSTCOME

Perl follows a “first-come” process for assigning ownership of a module.
The first person to upload the named module is granted FIRSTCOME permissions.
That person is able to release new versions or transfer permissions to another CPAN author or grant co-maintenance permissions (COMAINT) to one or more CPAN authors.
Only the FIRSTCOME permission allows an author to transfer ownership or grant permissions to a new co-maintainer, though the PAUSE admins can also grant COMAINT if it is deemed appropriate.

#### COMAINT

The COMAINT permission allows a CPAN author to issue a release of the module.

### Absent/Unresponsive Maintainers

As with many Open Source projects, maintainers can come and go over time.
Just because a new version of the module has not been released in some time it does not mean the maintainer is absent.
Some modules are “functionally complete” and unless something changes there may be no need for a new version to be released.

Absent maintainers however can sometimes be determined by looking at the release history of modules that they have released.
If the maintainer has not released any new or updated modules in several years, they may be absent.

CPAN signals absent maintainers by using the special users NEEDHELP, HANDOFF and ADOPTME, as documented in the PAUSE Operating Model, <https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_operating_model>.

In the case of both Spreadsheet::ParseExcel and Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX the maintainers who released the last version appear to have been absent and had not signaled that they needed help or that the modules were up for adoption.

#### NEEDHELP

Assigning COMAINT permissions to the special CPAN user NEEDHELP says that the owner is happy to give co-maint to anyone interested in helping with the module, but plans to retain ownership.

#### HANDOFF

Assigning COMAINT to the special CPAN user HANDOFF is a way for the current owner of a module to flag that they’re happy for someone else to take over ownership of the module.
One still needs to ask the owner to adopt the module.

#### ADOPTME

Assigning COMAINT permission to the ADOPTME user flags that a module is open to takeover.
If the owner is ADOPTME, it can also indicate a deceased author.
ADOPTME as co-maintiner can indicate a non-responsive author, or an author who has explicitly added ADOPTME.

XXE in default configuration of Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX in doy/spreadsheet-parsexlsx

 [Raw](/phvietan/d1c95a88ab6e17047b0248d6bf9eac4a/raw/b7c2c9fed1efac73865fbf1658fe21402e1f83d6/spreadsheet-parsexlsx-report.md)

[**spreadsheet-parsexlsx-report.md**](#file-spreadsheet-parsexlsx-report-md)

# Description

In default configuration of Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX, whenever we call `Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX->new()->parse('user_input_file.xlsx')`, we'd be vulnerable for XXE vulnerability if the XLSX file that we are parsing is from user input.

# Proof of Concept

Download the following files:

* PoC for loading `/etc/passwd`: <https://poc.drstra.in/parsexlsx-0c7977b1d40b/read.xlsx>
* PoC for triggering Denial of Service: <https://poc.drstra.in/parsexlsx-0c7977b1d40b/dos.xlsx>

Run the below code with perl: `perl vulnerable_server.pm` (remember to place the `vulnerable_server.pm` in the same directory with `read.xlsx`).

```
# vulnerable_server.pm
use Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX;

my $parser   = Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX->new();
my $workbook = $parser->parse('read.xlsx');
# my $workbook = $parser->parse('dos.xlsx');

my $worksheet = $workbook->worksheet(0);
my ($row_min, $row_max) = $worksheet->row_range;
my ($col_min, $col_max) = $worksheet->col_range;

my $data = [];

for my $r ($row_min ... $row_max) {
    my $cell = $worksheet->get_cell($r, $col_min);
    my $length = length $cell;
    if ($length != 0) {
        push @$data, $cell->value;
    }
}

foreach (@$data) {
  print "$_\n";
}
```

After running the code, you should see that it loads to `/etc/passwd` into our `$data` variable. This behavior is troublesome for servers that load xlsx file from users, and then the server tries to store those data into their database. This would cause the `/etc/passwd` to be stored into the database and potentially be read by the user if there is some kind of feature to read database.

# Bug details

1: calling `$parser->parse('read.xlsx')`; trigger the following code: <https://github.com/doy/spreadsheet-parsexlsx/blob/master/lib/Spreadsheet/ParseXLSX.pm#L66>

2: eventually, it will hit the function `$self->_parse_workbook` at: <https://github.com/doy/spreadsheet-parsexlsx/blob/master/lib/Spreadsheet/ParseXLSX.pm#L107>

3: within `$self->_parse_workbook`, it will eventually leads to `$self->_parse_sheet` function: <https://github.com/doy/spreadsheet-parsexlsx/blob/master/lib/Spreadsheet/ParseXLSX.pm#L188>

4: `$self->_parse_sheet` eventually leads to `$self->_new_twig`: <https://github.com/doy/spreadsheet-parsexlsx/blob/master/lib/Spreadsheet/ParseXLSX.pm#L229>

5: `$self->_new_twig` will call an outer library `XML::Twig->new`: <https://github.com/doy/spreadsheet-parsexlsx/blob/master/lib/Spreadsheet/ParseXLSX.pm#L1126>

We can read the documentation of XML::Twig at: [https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::Twig#no\_xxe](https://metacpan.org/pod/XML%3A%3ATwig#no_xxe) , you should see that it supports an option called no\_xxe that should eliminate the XXE vulnerability if we toggle this option. However, by default the Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX library forgot to use this option, which causes it to have XXE vulnerability in default configuration.

# Potential fix

* We could completely disable the XXE feature of XML::Twig by always set `no_xxe` to true
* Or we could create an option to allow users to enable XXE or not, in security perspective the default must be `no_xxe = true`, whoever try to toggle the XXE option is responsible for their behavior if there are any security incident.

Subject: CVE-2024-23525: Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX for Perl is vulnerable to XXE attacks

Hi,

An Pham discovered that the Perl module Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX 0.29 (and earlier) is vulnerable to XML external entity injection attacks when parsing a crafted XLSX file.

Users should upgrade to version 0.30 or later.

Fixed Version:
<https://metacpan.org/release/NUDDLEGG/Spreadsheet-ParseXLSX-0.30>

References:

Best,
Stig.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

      - Updated Dist::Zilla configuration fixing deprecation warnings

0.27  2016-08-16
      - Fix issues parsing sheets whose cell elements do not have location
        attributes (dgiordano, #61)

0.26  2016-08-16
      - Add explicit dependency on perl 5.10 (we apparently broke 5.8 support

      - Support reading files where the case is specified incorrectly (this is
        likely actually a bug in the program generating these files, but I
        don't think this fix is likely to break any real files) (Tux, #57)
      - Ensure we coerce hidden state for rows and columns to booleans
        (Jeffery Hammock)
