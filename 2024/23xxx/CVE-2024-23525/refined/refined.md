{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX Perl module, prior to version 0.30, is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection because it does not enable the `no_xxe` option in the underlying XML::Twig library. This default behavior allows the parser to load external entities specified in a crafted XLSX file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF), potentially accessing sensitive local files, or triggering a denial-of-service (DoS) by making the parser load a large file or an infinite resource.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a specially crafted XLSX file that includes a reference to an external XML entity. The application using Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX parses the file, leading to the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to upload or provide a malicious XLSX file to an application or service that uses the vulnerable version of the Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX module. No special privileges or user interaction are required, although user interaction is required to initiate the parsing process."
