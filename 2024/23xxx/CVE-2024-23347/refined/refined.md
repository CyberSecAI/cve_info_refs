- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Meta Spark Studio prior to v176 would execute scripts defined in a `package.json` file when opening a new project.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsanitized execution of scripts from a `package.json` file within project files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on the system with the privileges of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** Opening a maliciously crafted project file in Meta Spark Studio.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to create a malicious project file and trick a user into opening it in Meta Spark Studio.
