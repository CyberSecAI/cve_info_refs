The provided content is related to CVE-2024-23860.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient encoding of user-controlled inputs within the Cups Easy application, specifically in the `/cupseasylive/currencylist.php` page when handling the `description` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can allow a remote attacker to send a crafted URL to an authenticated user. If the user clicks the malicious URL, the attacker can steal their session cookie credentials. This could allow the attacker to impersonate the user and potentially gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
A remote attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a payload in the `description` parameter of `/cupseasylive/currencylist.php`. The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking this crafted URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and must convince an authenticated user of the Cups Easy application to click on the malicious link.
