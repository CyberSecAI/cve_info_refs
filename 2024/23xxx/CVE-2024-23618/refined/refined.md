- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unspecified vulnerability in Arris SURFboard SBG6950AC2 devices allows for arbitrary command execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows for arbitrary command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute code as root.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is accessible to unauthenticated attackers. The network access vector is adjacent (AV:A), requiring the attacker to be on the same local network segment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device to exploit the vulnerability. No authentication is required.
