Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-23775

**Root Cause:** An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the `mbedtls_x509_set_extension()` function within the Mbed TLS library. This occurs due to a lack of input validation when writing X.509 extensions. An attacker can pass specially crafted lengths, causing an integer overflow which results in a zero-length buffer allocation. When the extension data is copied into this undersized buffer, a heap buffer overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - Integer Overflow: A flaw in how input lengths are handled leads to an integer overflow.
  - Heap Buffer Overflow:  Due to the undersized buffer allocation, writing extension data causes a heap buffer overflow.
  - Lack of Input Validation: The `mbedtls_x509_set_extension()` function doesn't validate the provided input lengths which allows for the overflow to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - Potential Denial of Service (DoS): The heap buffer overflow can lead to a segmentation fault, potentially resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - Passing a crafted length to `mbedtls_x509_set_extension()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - An attacker needs to control or influence the input data length passed to the `mbedtls_x509_set_extension()` function. This would likely involve crafting malicious X.509 certificates or related data.

**Additional Notes:**
  - The vulnerability affects all versions of Mbed TLS up to and including 2.28.6 and 3.5.1.
  - The fix involves upgrading to Mbed TLS 3.5.2 or 2.28.7.
  - A workaround is to ensure that a length of SIZE_MAX cannot be passed into `mbedtls_x509_set_extension()`.
