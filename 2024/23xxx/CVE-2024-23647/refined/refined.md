Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-23647:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly references CVE-2024-23647 and provides detailed information about the vulnerability. Therefore, it is **RELEVANT**.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the implementation of PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) within the `authentik` software. Specifically, the authorization server fails to properly enforce the presence of the `code_challenge` parameter during the authorization request phase.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **PKCE Downgrade Attack:** The core vulnerability is a PKCE downgrade attack. The authorization server does not ensure that if a token request contains a `code_verifier`, a `code_challenge` must also have been present in the authorization request.
*  **Missing code_challenge validation**: authentik will not do the PKCE check if the `code_challenge` parameter is removed from the authorization request.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Circumvention of PKCE protection**: An attacker can bypass the security protections offered by PKCE by removing the `code_challenge` parameter from the authorization request, allowing a request to pass without the proper checks.
*   **Code injection attack**:  This downgrade attack allows for code injection, even if the OAuth client was configured to use PKCE.  The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a code injection attack, even if the OAuth client is using PKCE (which is supposed to protect against code injection attacks).

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Authorization Link**: An attacker can craft a malicious authorization link that omits the `code_challenge` parameter.
*   **Phishing**: The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link or initiating the authorization process without a `code_challenge` parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access**: The attacker needs network access to communicate with the authorization server.
*   **User Interaction**: The attacker needs to trick a user into initiating an authorization process via a crafted link, requiring user interaction.

**Technical Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability exists in `authentik` versions `<= 2023.10.6` and `<= 2023.8.6`.
*   Patched versions are `2023.10.7` and `2023.8.7`.
*   The attack involves removing the `code_challenge` parameter from the authorization request.
*   The OAuth BCP (<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics>) is referenced, specifically section 2.1.1, which states: *"Authorization servers MUST mitigate PKCE Downgrade Attacks by ensuring that a token request containing a code_verifier parameter is accepted only if a code_challenge parameter was present in the authorization request, see Section 4.8.2 for details.‚Äù*
*   The CVSS v3.1 base score is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N`
*   The CVSS v4 base score is `CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N`
*  The Github Advisory Database entry for the vulnerability is `GHSA-mrx3-gxjx-hjqj`
*  The reporter of the vulnerability was identified as pieterphilippaerts.
*  The vulnerability is also referred to as a PKCE downgrade attack.

**Additional Information:**

*   The content also provides links to the fix commit ([goauthentik/authentik@38e04ae](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/38e04ae12720e5d81b4f7ac77997eb8d1275d31a)) and the Github Advisory Database entry ([GHSA-mrx3-gxjx-hjqj](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-mrx3-gxjx-hjqj)) for the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2024-23647 is a moderate severity vulnerability in the `authentik` software that allows an attacker to circumvent PKCE by exploiting a missing check for the `code_challenge` parameter during authorization requests. This enables code injection attacks, making it essential to update to the patched versions.
