- Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses a JWT to carry parameters for image upload functionality. The application fails to properly sanitize the values from the JWT before reflecting them back into the HTML page within input elements, resulting in multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities. Specifically, the 'info' parameter, which contains the JWT, is vulnerable to XSS when the values of 'num', 'input', 'path', 'func', and 'is_water' within the decoded JWT are not sanitized. Additionally, the application's URL encoding/decoding logic seems to be flawed, leading it to accept "+" but not "-" which makes it easier to inject malicious payload.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - Improper input sanitization
    - Flawed URL encoding/decoding logic.
    
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - Cookie theft
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting user to malicious sites

- Attack vectors:
    - The attack vector is through a crafted URL that contains a JWT with malicious values in the 'num', 'input', 'path', 'func' or 'is_water' parameters within the JWT header. These malicious values are then reflected back into the page without being sanitized when the page loads.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL that includes a JWT with the vulnerable parameter to achieve XSS.
    - The attacker needs to convince an authenticated user (e.g. admin) to visit that malicious URL for the XSS to be executed and to potentially steal cookies.
