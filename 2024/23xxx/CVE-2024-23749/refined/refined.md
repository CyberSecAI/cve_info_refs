  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and validation within the `GetOneFile` function in `kitty.c`. Specifically, the `filename` variable, which is part of an ANSI escape sequence used for file transfers, is not properly sanitized before being concatenated into a command executed by `system()`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input sanitization and validation",
        "Failure to escape special characters",
        "Insecure use of system calls",
        "Lack of proper bounds checking for input"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user running the KiTTY application. This allows an attacker to execute malicious commands on the user's system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker can embed the malicious exploit within the `.bashrc` file of a remote server.",
        "The exploit can also be placed within the SSH warning/message of the day (MOTD) banner of a server.",
        "When a KiTTY user connects to the compromised server, the exploit is triggered via the malicious escape sequence.",
	"A malicious server can send the escape sequence directly"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or compromise a server that a KiTTY user connects to. This can be achieved through various means, such as compromising a server, or having the ability to modify files on the server, like `.bashrc` or MOTD banners."
