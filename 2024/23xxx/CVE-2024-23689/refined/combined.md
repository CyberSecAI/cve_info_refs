## Description

### Summary

As initially reported in issue [#1331](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/1331), when client certificate authentication is enabled with password protection, the password (referred to as the client option `sslkey`) may be exposed in client exceptions (e.g., ClickHouseException or SQLException). This vulnerability can potentially lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and violations of user privacy.

### Details

During the handling of ClickHouseException, the client certificate password may be inadvertently exposed when sslkey is specified. This issue can arise when an exception is thrown during the execution of a query or a database operation. The client certificate password is then included in the exception message, which could be logged or exposed to unauthorized parties.

### Impact

This vulnerability enables an attacker with access to client exception error messages or logs to obtain client certificate passwords, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information, data manipulation, and denial of service attacks. The extent of the risk depends on the specific implementation and usage of the affected systems. However, any exposure of client certificate passwords should be treated as a high-priority security concern.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Describe the bug

The following exception or similar exceptions have ClickHouseNode information converted to string and inserted into Exception message. This also is done for SSL key - exposing it, which is giant vulnerability.

org.springframework.jdbc.CannotGetJdbcConnectionException: Failed to obtain JDBC Connection; nested exception is java.sql.SQLException: No client available, server ClickHouseNode [uri=, options={sslmode=strict,use\_server\_time\_zone=true,sslkey=**herecomesthekey**,sslcert=certpath}]@724546415

### Expected behaviour

I think that either SSL key must be removed from toString conversion or at least replaced with \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

## Description

### Summary

As initially reported in issue #1331, when client certificate authentication is enabled with password protection, the password (referred to as the client option `sslkey`) may be exposed in client exceptions (e.g., ClickHouseException or SQLException). This vulnerability can potentially lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and violations of user privacy.

### Details

During the handling of ClickHouseException, the client certificate password may be inadvertently exposed when sslkey is specified. This issue can arise when an exception is thrown during the execution of a query or a database operation. The client certificate password is then included in the exception message, which could be logged or exposed to unauthorized parties.

### Impact

This vulnerability enables an attacker with access to client exception error messages or logs to obtain client certificate passwords, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information, data manipulation, and denial of service attacks. The extent of the risk depends on the specific implementation and usage of the affected systems. However, any exposure of client certificate passwords should be treated as a high-priority security concern.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
