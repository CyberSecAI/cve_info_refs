  "CVE-2024-23638": {
    "description": "Squid is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against Cache Manager error responses due to an expired pointer reference bug.",
    "root_cause": "Expired pointer reference bug",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-825"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) against Cache Manager error responses",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A trusted client with low privileges can generate error pages for Client Manager reports",
        "details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a client generating error pages for Client Manager reports, exploiting an expired pointer reference bug that causes an assertion failure in the `handleReply` function. The issue occurs when the `clientReplyContext::pushStreamData` function passes NULL data, leading to a crash. An earlier fix to remove excessive calls actually addresses the core memory corruption issue, and the current fix is to prevent the crash by checking for invalid data before performing operations.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Squid versions 5.0 through 5.9 and 6.0 prior to 6.6",
        "NetApp BlueXP"
    ],
   "remediation": "Upgrade to Squid version 6.6 or apply the provided patches for Squid 5 and Squid 6. NetApp BlueXP implemented a workaround within squid.conf."
