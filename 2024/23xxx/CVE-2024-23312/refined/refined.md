- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled search path in the IntelÂ® Binary Configuration Tool software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly control the search path, potentially allowing an attacker to influence the execution of the tool by placing malicious files in locations where the tool might search for libraries or other executables.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated user could potentially escalate their privileges via local access.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access. The attacker must be an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system. The attacker needs to be able to place malicious files in the search path the vulnerable software uses.
