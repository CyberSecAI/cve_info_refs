- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Command injection in the `Callback` parameter when handling UPnP SUBSCRIBE messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated command injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device as root.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered through sending crafted UPnP SUBSCRIBE messages to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device to send the crafted UPnP messages.
