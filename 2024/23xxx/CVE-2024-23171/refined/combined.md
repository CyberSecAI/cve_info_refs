# Description

In Special:EventDetails, there are a bunch of i18n-based XSSs reproducible via the x-xss language. To reproduce,

To reproduce:

1. First, you need to choose the right wiki. The easiest way is to do this locally, enabling the x-xss language setting in your LS.php. Else you can use the beta cluster, but you will have to add HTML to the messages mentioned below for the XSS to show.
2. Then, you will first need to create an event:
   1. Make sure you're logged-in
   2. Create a page in the Event: namespace
   3. In the popup that appears post-save, click "Enable registration"
   4. Fill out the form (just the dates are required), submit.
   5. Click the link to go back to the event page
   6. Now you need to register for the event as a participant. Ideally, you need to do this with at least 3 different accounts. When you open the event page as a non-organizer, you will find a "Register for event" button to do that.
3. Once you have an event with at least 3 participants, click the "manage event" button in the event page (or go to Special:EventDetails/X where X is the ID of your event, if you know it)
4. Switch to the "Participants" tab

Once you're there, there are a bunch of XSSs you can reproduce in different ways.

1. Click the checkbox in the table header. You will see an alert from the campaignevents-email-participants-all message.
2. Then, individually unselect 2 of the participants. You will see another alert from the campaignevents-email-participants-except-count message.
3. Then, deselect everyone and individually select 2 participants. You'll get another alert from the campaignevents-email-participants-count message.

The root cause of these is the same: the [code in question](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/g/mediawiki/extensions/CampaignEvents/%2B/162b47cf3a469eed66fbb0d40ee43227b6a19ffa/resources/ext.campaignEvents.specialeventdetails/EmailManager.js#91) uses .append() instead of .text().

Note that this code is relatively recent ([r936290](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/extensions/CampaignEvents/%2B/936290), [r944928](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/extensions/CampaignEvents/%2B/944928)), only included in wmf.41 branches, and only enabled in a few wikis (see wmgUseCampaignEvents).

Yep, that's always the safest bet, even if we sometimes handle these message issues publicly. We can likely get this deployed during [next Monday's (2023-10-09) security deployment window](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deployments#deploycal-item-20231009T2100). CR+2 to the patch, by the way.

Is this the process to apply in this case, given that the vulnerable code is in master only? And also in REL1\_41, but that's still beta, and not a release yet.

Since ext:CampaignEvents isn't bundled with the core release, this issue could theoretically be disclosed and backported at any time, now that a fix is in Wikimedia production. The supplemental security release, released at the end of each quarter by the [Security-Team](/tag/security-team/), is more of a catch-all, as it will disclose anything that hasn't been disclosed or re-announce an issue if it has already been disclosed.

Yeah, I guess my point was: the vulnerable code was introduced recently, and no MW release is affected. Only 1.41 will be affected, if the fix is not pushed and backported before the release date (which I believe will be in November). But then again, given that 1.41 has not been released yet, I thought in this case we could make the fix in master and backport it to REL1\_41, so that it would be included in 1.41.0.

As you said, this maybe doesn't make much sense given that the extension isn't in the tarball. But OTOH, REL1\_41 of the extension should only work with MW 1.41, and because that's still not a thing, nobody should be using REL1\_41 just yet.

At any rate, it doesn't really make much difference, except for the (small?) overhead of tracking an additional security patch applied in production. I just thought this could've gone through a simpler process.

Sure. It's completely fine to make this task public now if that's what you and/or other CampaignEvents developers would like to do. And then send a change set up to gerrit for master and any other relevant branches.

I think it should be fairly safe to do so, but would like to hear from [@cmelo](/p/cmelo/) [@MHorsey-WMF](/p/MHorsey-WMF/) [@VPuffetMichel](/p/VPuffetMichel/).

I've just made this task public (folks with certain [acl\*security](/tag/acl_security/) access can do so). So now it should be possible for folks to push up any relevant backports through gerrit and have the bot comment here. Once the patch has been merged to master, it should then be removed from WMF production as a security patch, typically during the following week's train deploys. And we'll still plan to re-announce this at the end of the quarter with the supplemental security release ([T347659](/T347659)).

scap should throw an error when the patch no longer applies, when releng attempt to stage the train. But I can keep watching this task, and when the change set for master gets merged, I'll remove the patch from T276237 and any future release dirs within /srv/patches on deployment.
