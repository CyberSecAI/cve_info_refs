Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the default enabled state of two Electron fuses: `runAsNode` and `enableNodeCliInspectArguments`. These fuses, when enabled, allow an attacker with local access to the machine to run an Electron application as a Node.js process with the application's existing permissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **`runAsNode` fuse:** This fuse, when enabled, allows the `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` environment variable to be respected, which can be exploited to run the Electron app as a Node.js process.
*   **`enableNodeCliInspectArguments` fuse:** This fuse allows for command-line inspection arguments, which can be manipulated to execute arbitrary code.
*   The combination of these enabled features allows for a "living off the land" attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker with local access can execute arbitrary code by using the Electron application as a Node.js process.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Limited):** The attacker inherits the permissions granted to the Electron application. For instance, if the application has access to the address book, the attacker's code will also have that access.
*   **"Living off the Land" Attack:** The attacker leverages the existing application and its permissions, instead of introducing new tools or executables.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector requires the attacker to have existing local access to the machine where the vulnerable Electron application is installed. This could be achieved through physical access or by gaining remote code execution through other vulnerabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to execute commands on the target machine. This implies either physical access or remote code execution through another exploit.
*   The attacker needs to target an Electron app that has not disabled the `runAsNode` and `enableNodeCliInspectArguments` fuses.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The Electron team considers the severity of the CVE to be overstated, as it requires prior local access, not remote access.
*   They recommend disabling the `runAsNode` fuse to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The content also mentions a tool called `electroniz3r` that can be used to identify vulnerable Electron applications.

In summary, CVE-2024-23739 describes a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Electron applications due to the default enabled state of `runAsNode` and `enableNodeCliInspectArguments` fuses. This allows a local attacker to run an Electron app as a Node.js process with the same permissions as the app, which they can then leverage for arbitrary code execution. The Electron team considers this a less critical vulnerability because it requires prior local access to the targeted machine.

**Note:** The content from github.com includes a demonstration of how to use the exploit, including screenshots of a tool called `electroniz3r` being used to identify vulnerable apps and achieve a shell after exploiting the vulnerability.
