- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Path traversal vulnerability
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Bypass of folder-level role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can access folders, files, and datasets even if they don't have the necessary privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Path traversal attack
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the source and at least one folder within the source.
