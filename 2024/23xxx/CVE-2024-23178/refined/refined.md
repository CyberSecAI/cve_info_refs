{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the PhonosButton.js script appending an unescaped message text (specifically, the 'phonos-purge-needed-error' message) to the page content using jQuery's `append()` method. This method interprets the message content as HTML. The `phonos-purge-needed-error` message is user-controlled through i18n, making it possible for an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Input Handling",
      "Use of `append()` with user-controlled content"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session by crafting a malicious `phonos-purge-needed-error` message. This could lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.",
    "attack_vectors": "The primary attack vector is through the modification of the `phonos-purge-needed-error` message in the i18n configuration. Once this is set to a malicious payload, triggering the handleMissingFile() function will execute the payload by appending the message into the HTML.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to modify the i18n message configuration for `phonos-purge-needed-error`. This could be an administrator of the MediaWiki instance or an attacker who gains control over the i18n message data."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "fix_details": "The vulnerability was fixed by changing the method of injection from `append()` to `text()` method in the javascript. This change prevents the message from being interpreted as HTML, thereby mitigating the XSS risk. A follow up patch was required to ensure a link was still rendered correctly.",
     "discovery": "The vulnerability was discovered by a user by chance. They encountered the error message and realized the code was vulnerable after encountering similar XSS vulnerabilities.",
      "risk_rating": "Low"
