| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=7975#c0)  Shiloong   admin  2024-01-19 10:49:57 UTC  ``` on behalf of Gui-Dong Han <2045gemini@gmail.com>:  In raid5_cache_count():     if (conf->max_nr_stripes < conf->min_nr_stripes)         return 0;     return conf->max_nr_stripes - conf->min_nr_stripes; The current check is ineffective, as the values could change immediately after being checked.  In raid5_set_cache_size():     ...     conf->min_nr_stripes = size;     ...     while (size > conf->max_nr_stripes)         conf->min_nr_stripes = conf->max_nr_stripes;     ...  Due to intermediate value updates in raid5_set_cache_size(), concurrent execution of raid5_cache_count() and raid5_set_cache_size() may lead to inconsistent reads of conf->max_nr_stripes and conf->min_nr_stripes. The current checks are ineffective as values could change immediately after being checked, raising the risk of conf->min_nr_stripes exceeding conf->max_nr_stripes and potentially causing an integer overflow.  This possible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tool developed by our team. This tool analyzes the locking APIs to extract function pairs that can be concurrently executed, and then analyzes the instructions in the paired functions to identify possible concurrency bugs including data races and atomicity violations. The above possible bug is reported when our tool analyzes the source code of Linux 6.2.  To resolve this issue, it is suggested to introduce local variables 'min_stripes' and 'max_stripes' in raid5_cache_count() to ensure the values remain stable throughout the check. Adding locks in raid5_cache_count() fails to resolve atomicity violations, as raid5_set_cache_size() may hold intermediate values of conf->min_nr_stripes while unlocked. With this patch applied, our tool no longer reports the bug, with the kernel configuration allyesconfig for x86_64. Due to the lack of associated hardware, we cannot test the patch in runtime testing, and just verify it according to the code logic.
