Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-23945:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `CookieSigner` class in Apache Hive and Spark, when verifying signed cookies, exposed the correct signature in the exception message if the signature was invalid. This was a debugging message that leaked sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is that the valid, expected signature of a cookie is revealed in the exception message when signature verification fails. This exposes sensitive data that could be used by an attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker can potentially use the leaked valid signature to forge valid cookies. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Unauthorized access to resources and data
  - Privilege escalation
  - Data modification
  - Other malicious activities, depending on the application logic that relies on these cookies

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker would need to send a request with an invalid cookie to the server. The server's response would then include the exception message containing the valid signature, assuming the attacker can trigger the code path in the CookieSigner that performs verification and throws the exception.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable server and send HTTP requests.
- No specific position within the network is required; this can be done remotely.
- The attacker needs to have some knowledge of how the cookie signing is used to send a malformed or modified cookie.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in Apache Hive via issue HIVE-9710 and in Apache Spark via SPARK-14987.
- The fix involved removing the original and current signatures from the exception message, providing a generic "Invalid sign" exception instead.
- The affected components are `org.apache.hive:hive-service`, `org.apache.spark:spark-hive-thriftserver_2.11`, and `org.apache.spark:spark-hive-thriftserver_2.12`.
- The vulnerability affects a range of Apache Hive (1.2.0 before 4.0.0) and Apache Spark versions (2.0.0 before 3.0.0, 3.0.0 before 3.3.4, 3.4.0 before 3.4.2, 3.5.0).
