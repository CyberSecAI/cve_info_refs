The Apache Hive (TM) data warehouse software facilitates reading,
writing, and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage
using SQL. Built on top of Apache Hadoop (TM), it provides:

* Tools to enable easy access to data via SQL, thus enabling data
  warehousing tasks such as extract/transform/load (ETL), reporting,
  and data analysis
* A mechanism to impose structure on a variety of data formats
* Access to files stored either directly in Apache HDFS (TM) or in other
  data storage systems such as Apache HBase (TM)
* Query execution using Apache Hadoop MapReduce or Apache Tez frameworks.

Hive provides standard SQL functionality, including many of the later
2003 and 2011 features for analytics. These include OLAP functions,
subqueries, common table expressions, and more. Hive's SQL can also be
extended with user code via user defined functions (UDFs), user defined
aggregates (UDAFs), and user defined table functions (UDTFs).

Hive users can choose between Apache Hadoop MapReduce or Apache Tez
frameworks as their execution backend. Note that MapReduce framework
has been deprecated since Hive 2, and Apache Tez is recommended. MapReduce
is a mature framework that is proven at large scales. However, MapReduce
is a purely batch framework, and queries using it may experience
higher latencies (tens of seconds), even over small datasets. Apache
Tez is designed for interactive query, and has substantially reduced
overheads versus MapReduce.

Users are free to switch back and forth between these frameworks
at any time. In each case, Hive is best suited for use cases
where the amount of data processed is large enough to require a
distributed system.

Hive is not designed for online transaction processing. It is best used
for traditional data warehousing tasks. Hive is designed to maximize
scalability (scale out with more machines added dynamically to the Hadoop
cluster), performance, extensibility, fault-tolerance, and
loose-coupling with its input formats.

# Requirements

## Java

| Hive Version | Java Version |
| --- | --- |
| Hive 1.0 | Java 6 |
| Hive 1.1 | Java 6 |
| Hive 1.2 | Java 7 |
| Hive 2.x | Java 7 |
| Hive 3.x | Java 8 |

# Upgrading from older versions of Hive

* Hive includes changes to the MetaStore schema. If
  you are upgrading from an earlier version of Hive it is imperative
  that you upgrade the MetaStore schema by running the appropriate
  schema upgrade scripts located in the scripts/metastore/upgrade
  directory.
* We have provided upgrade scripts for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle,
  Microsoft SQL Server, and Derby databases. If you are using a
  different database for your MetaStore you will need to provide
  your own upgrade script.

# Apache Spark

Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
pandas API on Spark for pandas workloads, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Structured Streaming for stream processing.

## Online Documentation

You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the [project web page](https://spark.apache.org/documentation.html).
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.

## Building Spark

Spark is built using [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
To build Spark and its example programs, run:

```
./build/mvn -DskipTests clean package
```

(You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.)

More detailed documentation is available from the project site, at
["Building Spark"](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html).

For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see ["Useful Developer Tools"](https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html).

## Interactive Scala Shell

The easiest way to start using Spark is through the Scala shell:

```
./bin/spark-shell
```

Try the following command, which should return 1,000,000,000:

```
scala> spark.range(1000 * 1000 * 1000).count()
```

## Interactive Python Shell

Alternatively, if you prefer Python, you can use the Python shell:

```
./bin/pyspark
```

And run the following command, which should also return 1,000,000,000:

```
>>> spark.range(1000 * 1000 * 1000).count()
```

## Example Programs

Spark also comes with several sample programs in the `examples` directory.
To run one of them, use `./bin/run-example <class> [params]`. For example:

```
./bin/run-example SparkPi
```

will run the Pi example locally.

You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. This can be spark:// URL,
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local[N]" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance:

```
MASTER=spark://host:7077 ./bin/run-example SparkPi
```

Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.

## Running Tests

Testing first requires [building Spark](#building-spark). Once Spark is built, tests
can be run using:

```
./dev/run-tests
```

Please see the guidance on how to
[run tests for a module, or individual tests](https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#individual-tests).

There is also a Kubernetes integration test, see resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/README.md

## A Note About Hadoop Versions

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Please refer to the build documentation at
["Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN"](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html#specifying-the-hadoop-version-and-enabling-yarn)
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

## Configuration

Please refer to the [Configuration Guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html)
in the online documentation for an overview on how to configure Spark.

## Contributing

Please review the [Contribution to Spark guide](https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html)
for information on how to get started contributing to the project.

Subject: CVE-2024-23945: Apache Hive and Spark: CookieSigner exposes the
 correct signature when message verification fails

Severity: important

Affected versions:

- Apache Hive 1.2.0 before 4.0.0
- Apache Spark 2.0.0 before 3.0.0
- Apache Spark 3.0.0 before 3.3.4
- Apache Spark 3.4.0 before 3.4.2
- Apache Spark 3.5.0

Description:

Signing cookies is an application security feature that adds a digital
signature to cookie data to verify its authenticity and integrity. The
signature helps prevent malicious actors from modifying the cookie
value, which can lead to security vulnerabilities and exploitation.
Apache Hive’s service component accidentally exposes the signed cookie
to the end user when there is a mismatch in signature between the
current and expected cookie. Exposing the correct cookie signature can
lead to further exploitation.

The vulnerable CookieSigner logic was introduced in Apache Hive by
HIVE-9710 (1.2.0) and in Apache Spark by SPARK-14987 (2.0.0). The
affected components are the following:
* org.apache.hive:hive-service
* org.apache.spark:spark-hive-thriftserver_2.11
* org.apache.spark:spark-hive-thriftserver_2.12
