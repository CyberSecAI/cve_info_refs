Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SSA-017796: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Tecnomatix Plant Simulation

| Publication Date: | 2024-02-13 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2024-02-13 |
| Current Version: | V1.0 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.8 |
| CVSS v4.0 Base Score: | 7.3 |

SUMMARY

Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation contains multiple file parsing vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application reads files in WRL, PSOBJ or SPP file formats. If a user is tricked to open a malicious file with any of the affected products, this could lead the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.

WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Do not open untrusted WRL, PSOBJ, or SPP files from using Tecnomatix Plant Simulation

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>
