- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A user with a contributor or higher privilege can execute an arbitrary script on the web browser of the user who accesses the website using the product.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker (with contributor or higher privileges) injects malicious JavaScript code which is then executed when another user accesses the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least contributor privileges in the affected system. User interaction is required as the malicious script is executed in the browser of the victim user who accesses the website.
