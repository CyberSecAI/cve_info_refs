Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing `checkLink(String)` override in the `SecurityManager` of the `artemis-java-test-sandbox` library. This omission allows students (or any user with the ability to execute code within the sandbox) to load arbitrary libraries using `System.load(String)` or `System.loadLibrary(String)`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is the lack of proper restrictions on loading libraries within the sandbox environment. The `SecurityManager` does not prevent the loading of arbitrary libraries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By loading malicious native libraries, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the vulnerable application/sandbox environment. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system or environment where the code is running.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability Impact:** The CVSS metrics highlight a high impact across all these categories (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability) due to the potential to read, modify, or disrupt resources in the application's scope.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable sandbox environment is running. This is indicated by the CVSS `AV:L` (Attack Vector: Local).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges Required:** An attacker with low privileges is enough to exploit the vulnerability. This is indicated by CVSS `PR:L` (Privileges Required: Low).
- **User Interaction Required:** The user must be involved in some action (although low) to trigger the vulnerability - for instance, to load and execute code.  This is indicated by CVSS `UI:R` (User Interaction: Required).
- **Ability to Load Arbitrary Libraries:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a path to load malicious native libraries, which are loaded through vulnerable `System.load(String)` or `System.loadLibraryâ€‹(String)` calls.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `de.tum.in.ase:artemis-java-test-sandbox` versions less than `1.11.2`.
- The fix involves adding a `checkExec` method override to the security manager that throws a `SecurityException` when attempting to load libraries.
- The vulnerability is assigned GHSA-98hq-4wmw-98w9, but as of the information provided, lacks a CVE ID. Vulncheck.com assigns it the id CVE-2024-23681.
- The CVSS score is 8.3 with the vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.
