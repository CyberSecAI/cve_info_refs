# Loading system libraries is possible

published
GHSA-98hq-4wmw-98w9
Feb 10, 2023

## Package

maven

de.tum.in.ase.artemis-java-test-sandbox
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<= 1.11.1

## Patched versions

1.11.2

## Description

### Summary

Because of the missing `checkLink(String)` override in the SecurityManager, students can load libraries and execute arbitrary code.

### Details

Using `System.load(String)` or `System.loadLibrary​(String)` students can load and execute arbitrary code.

```
private static native void start(List<String> args);

public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.load(new File("path_to_lib.so").getAbsolutePath());
  start(List.of(args));
}
```

Adding this to the security manager (and a translation) should fix the issue:

```
@Override
public void checkExec(String cmd) {
  try {
    if (enterPublicInterface())
      return;
    throw new SecurityException(localized("security.error_link")); //$NON-NLS-1$
  } finally {
    exitPublicInterface();
  }
}
```
### PoC

### Impact

Arbitrary code execution.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
