The provided content is related to CVE-2024-23348.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper input validation (CWE-20) leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, a specially crafted SVG file can be uploaded and used to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code by uploading a specially crafted SVG file. This could lead to various malicious actions, including but not limited to, session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely (AV:N).
*   The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
*   A user with low privileges can exploit the vulnerability (PR:L)
*   User interaction is required (UI:R).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a low privileged account on the affected system to upload a malicious SVG file. They also need to trick another user to trigger the XSS payload.
