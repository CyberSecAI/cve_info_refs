{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `lib-auth` login method in Enonic XP does not invalidate the old session before creating a new one, leading to a session fixation vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Session Fixation (CWE-384)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially hijack a user's session by setting the session ID before the user logs in. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could set a session ID on a user's browser and then, after the user logs in, gain access to their account by using the same session ID.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the user's session ID, which is typically done through network manipulation or other means of injecting a cookie value before the user authenticates."

  "ghsa_id": "GHSA-4m5p-5w5w-3jcf",
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability is related to the way the login handler manages sessions. The fix involves invalidating the existing session and replicating its attributes to a new one after a successful login. The vulnerability affects all id-providers using the `lib-auth` login method. The provided commit links show the code changes that address the session fixation issue."
