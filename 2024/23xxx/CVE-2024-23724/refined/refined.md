Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed in the provided content, which relates to CVE-2024-23724:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in SVG Uploads

**Root Cause:**
- The Ghost CMS platform did not properly sanitize SVG files uploaded by users, specifically in staff profile pictures. This allowed malicious users to embed JavaScript code within SVG files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of SVG Sanitization:** The primary vulnerability was the absence of proper sanitization of SVG files during the upload process. This allowed arbitrary JavaScript code embedded within the SVG to be executed in the context of the user's browser.
- **Trust of Staff Users:** Initially, the Ghost team declined to fix this issue based on the idea that staff users are trusted users. However, this neglects the possibility of staff accounts being compromised or misused.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS Attacks:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of other users (or staff), potentially leading to:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Modifying content of the website.
    - Other malicious actions within the applicationâ€™s context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The vulnerability was exploitable by uploading a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript.
- **Staff Profile Picture:** The specific vulnerability was identified in the staff profile picture upload functionality, but could potentially affect other file upload points that do not properly sanitize SVG files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needed an account with the ability to upload an SVG file. Initially, the vulnerability existed with staff accounts, but it could impact other user roles with file upload capabilities.
- **Crafted SVG:** The attacker needs the capability to embed malicious JavaScript within a valid SVG file format.

**Mitigation:**
- **DOMPurify Integration:** The vulnerability was addressed by integrating the `DOMPurify` library to sanitize SVG content during the upload process. This ensures that all potentially harmful code is removed from the SVG files before they are stored or served by the application.
- **Server-Side DOM Emulation:**  The `jsdom` library was used to emulate a DOM environment, which `DOMPurify` requires to operate in a server-side context, as the server processes the uploaded files.
- **Configuration of DOMPurify:** Specifically, the configuration `USE_PROFILES: {svg: true}` was suggested to ensure the sanitization operates within the SVG namespace, mitigating potential mXSS vulnerabilities.
- **Replication of Tests:** `dompurify` modifies the base content so a flag to verify if changes were made were not provided. This caused issues when trying to test the changes and led to a new solution using another library.

**Additional Notes:**
- The initial patch was replaced by a different solution due to issues with testing.
