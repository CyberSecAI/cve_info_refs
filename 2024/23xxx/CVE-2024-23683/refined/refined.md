Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2024-23683:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an incomplete blacklist in the test failure processing within the Artemis Java Test Sandbox. Specifically, the `ReflectionUtils.getUnderlyingCause` method in JUnit was not included in the blacklist. This allowed a malicious subclass of `InvocationTargetException` to bypass the security manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incomplete Blacklist:** The primary weakness is the incomplete blacklist of methods that can be called in a trusted context. The `ReflectionUtils.getUnderlyingCause` method was overlooked, allowing for a bypass of the intended security measures.
*   **Trust Boundary Violation:**  The vulnerability allows student code to execute within a trusted context due to how JUnit handles exceptions. JUnit extracts the cause of an `InvocationTargetException` using `getUnderlyingCause` before the exception reaches Ares, thereby bypassing Ares' security checks.
*   **Abuse of Generics:** The exploit uses Java generics to throw checked exceptions without a `throws` clause, enabling the creation of a malicious `InvocationTargetException` subclass.
*   **Overriding `getTargetException()`:**  The `getTargetException` method of `InvocationTargetException` can be overridden by subclasses, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary code within a whitelisted stack frame.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows arbitrary student-written code to execute in a privileged, trusted context.
*   **Security Manager Bypass:** The attacker can uninstall the `ArtemisSecurityManager`, completely disabling the sandbox.
*   **Full System Control:** With the security manager disabled, the attacker can perform any action expressible in Java, including file system access, network connections, and shell command execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Test Code:** The primary attack vector involves students crafting malicious test cases that utilize the vulnerable code path.
*   **Subclassed `InvocationTargetException`:** The attack involves creating a custom subclass of `InvocationTargetException` (e.g., `EvilInvocationTargetException`).
*   **Whitelisted Packages:** The attacker places this malicious subclass in a whitelisted package, allowing it to be called from within a seemingly trusted context.
* **Generics:** Exploiting generics to throw exceptions without a throws clause

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Submission:** The attacker needs the ability to submit Java code that will be executed within the Artemis test environment, such as a student submitting code for an exercise.
*   **Basic Java Knowledge:** A moderate understanding of Java and reflection is needed to craft the malicious exception and exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Placement in a Whitelisted Package:** The attacker needs to be able to place the malicious class in a trusted package.
*   **Triggering the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to cause a test to throw an `InvocationTargetException` that will trigger the vulnerable code path in JUnit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by blacklisting `ReflectionUtils.getUnderlyingCause` in `ArtemisSecurityManager`.
*   The fix also allows the security manager to check method names in the stack.
*   A security test was added to prevent similar exploits.
* The vulnerability was assigned GHSA-883x-6fch-6wjx, and a patch was released in version 1.7.6.
