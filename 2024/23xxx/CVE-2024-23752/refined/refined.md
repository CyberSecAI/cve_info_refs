The provided content is related to CVE-2024-23752.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `SDFCodeExecutor` in the `pandas-ai` library, which executes Python code generated by an LLM without proper checks. This allows for prompt injection when a dataframe with malicious content is provided to the `GenerateSDFPipeline`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Prompt Injection:** Maliciously crafted dataframe content can inject code into the prompt given to the LLM.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The `SDFCodeExecutor` executes the generated python code without sanitization, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution on the system running the vulnerable code. This can lead to data loss, system compromise, or other malicious activities, as demonstrated by the provided proof of concept where a file was deleted.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a maliciously crafted dataframe to the `GenerateSDFPipeline`, the attacker injects code into the prompt for the LLM.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the content of the dataframe fed into the `GenerateSDFPipeline`.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.0+ by removing the synthetic pipeline generation.
