- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Splunk RapidDiag utility discloses server responses to an external application upload request in a log file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Information Disclosure (CWE-532)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Disclosure of potentially sensitive information contained in server responses.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor could potentially access the log files containing server responses if they have access to the system where the logs are stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least low privileged access to the Splunk Enterprise instance where the log files are stored.
