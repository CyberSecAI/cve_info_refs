{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `minute` parameter within the `setScheduleCfg` request is vulnerable to OS command injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "OS Command Injection due to insufficient input sanitization of the `minute` parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the target device.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint with a malicious `minute` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target device's web interface, which might require being on the same network or having access through a port forwarding configuration."
