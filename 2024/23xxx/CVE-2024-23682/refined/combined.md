# Class Loading Vulnerability

High

[MaisiKoleni](/MaisiKoleni)
published
GHSA-227w-wv4j-67h4
Feb 9, 2022

## Package

maven

de.tum.in.ase.artemis-java-test-sandbox
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 1.8.0

## Patched versions

1.8.0

## Description

### Impact

This affects all Artemis users who test Java assignments. **Ares is not required.**

Students code that gets automatically tested can run arbitrary code in the container,

or arbitrary code on the machine of an assessor in case of manual correction.

### Patches

The problem cannot be resolved easily in Ares itself. Use the Maven Enforcer Plugin as follows:

```
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-enforcer-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>enforce-no-student-code-in-trusted-packages</id>
            <phase>process-classes</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>enforce</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <rules>
            <requireFilesDontExist>
                <files>
                    <!-- ADD HERE THE RULES ARES TELLS YOU ARE MISSING -->
                </files>
            </requireFilesDontExist>
        </rules>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

This fails the build if student classes reside in such packages that Ares trusts. Trusted packages added in Ares using `@AddTrustedPackage` should be added as well.

### For more information

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

[`30da718`](/ls1intum/Ares/commit/30da71893a42c2bd69fea885934f96d4a1792c49)

## Security

* See [GHSA-227w-wv4j-67h4](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares/security/advisories/GHSA-227w-wv4j-67h4) (CVSS Score 8.2 High) for details (credits to [@juliuskreutz](https://github.com/juliuskreutz))

  There is also more information regarding migration and mitigation in the [README](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares#what-you-need-to-do-outside-ares). This also resolved [#15](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares/issues/15).

## User-Side Changes

* Completed more parts of the `README`:
  + [Testing Console Interaction](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares#testing-console-interaction)
  + [Networking](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares#networking)
  + [Locale](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares#locale)
* Update from Jqwik version `1.6.0` to version `1.6.3`. See [their release notes](https://jqwik.net/release-notes.html) for details.
* Update to AssertJ version `3.22.0`. See [their `3.22.0` release notes](https://assertj.github.io/doc/#assertj-core-3-22-0-release-notes) for details.
* All major Ares annotations are now inherited. See [#124](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares/issues/124) and [792afcb](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares/commit/792afcb6c5a3a90876c3fab8e3ff13845b132513) for details.

  In short, this means that Ares annotations can be applied to superclasses of the test classes.
* Promoted large parts of the API to be stable/maintained. See [5dce034](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares/commit/5dce03422768cfe4f5541dde3fee04fb584bda65) for details.
* Removed the experimental (and useless) method display name obfuscation feature (`@ObfuscateMethodNamesBeforeDeadline`).

## Developer-Side Changes

* `README.md` is now `README.adoc`, as [AsciiDoc](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/) allows for a more expressive documentation. ([JUnit 5 User Guide](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) is for example AsciiDoc)
* A few more tests, e.g. for the new security feature and reflection usage.
* Multiple minor dependency updates:
  + `spotless-maven-plugin`
  + `maven-jar-plugin`
  + `maven-compiler-plugin`
  + `maven-deploy-plugin`

| Improve security by disallowing students to create classes in the whitelisted packages in the SecurityManager by configuring a custom Proxy for the ClassLoader which will throw `SecurityException`s in such cases.  Securing the testing process will be much simpler because we can trust classes in these packages blindly at runtime. However, this will not replace the Throwable-sanitization. |

| As a workaround, this can also be archived by telling the Maven compiler plugin to compile only classes in certain packages, like the main package of the exercise set in Artemis for example. |

| A short overview what is possible and what not:   1. `maven-compiler-plugin` you can use include and exclude here, but the plugin will auto-include transitive sources that are not directly included themselves which defeats the security 2. One could delete unwanted sources with e.g. the `maven-clean-plugin`. While that does ensure the security, students that use other packages will get even stranger build errors reporting that classes could not be found. 3. Create a class loader that does not load classes of trusted packages from certain locations, e.g. outside of jar archives. However, enforcing the use of such a class loader dynamically only for student classes is very hard and error prone, possibly even more so than the path access and thread management. This is further complicated by the other test tool that create new class loaders on-the-fly. 4. Write an `ares-maven-plugin` that checks which classes have been compiled and fails the build with an intelligible error message if one violates the package restrictions. 5. Make Ares scan the class path at runtime for violations. This requires that Ares knows what classes are test classes and what are student classes.   Since 1 does not secure the build, it is not an option. 2 could be used, but would only work for maven builds, in an IDE that would have no effect. The same problem arises for 4. 3 would similar to the package restrictions of [#13](https://github.com/ls1intum/Ares/issues/13) only work during/before class loading and is hard to realize. For 5, I am unsure how well that could work.  In my eyes, a combination of 3 and 4 would be preferred.  Are there other options left? What would you prefer? I would be happy to hear more ideas. |

| To some degree a workaround with `ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader().resources(trustedPackage.replace('.','/'))` could help to find file locations that add, hide or override trusted packages. This is however difficult with all possible and different IDE and exercise testing setups. |
