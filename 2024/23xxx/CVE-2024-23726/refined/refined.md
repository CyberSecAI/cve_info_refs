{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Predictable default WPA2 PSKs on Ubee DDW365 devices.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use of default credentials (CWE-1392). The Wi-Fi PSK is generated using a predictable algorithm based on the SSID and BSSID, making it easy to derive.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthorized remote access, potential denial of service, escalation of privileges, and information disclosure.",
  "Attack vectors": "By observing beacon frames, an attacker can obtain the SSID and BSSID. Using the predictable algorithm (first 6 characters of SSID + last 6 of BSSID, decrementing the last digit), the attacker can then derive the default WPA2-PSK.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in proximity to the Wi-Fi network to observe beacon frames."
