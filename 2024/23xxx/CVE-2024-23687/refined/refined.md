Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `mod-data-export-spring` module uses a hard-coded username and password for a system user, which is used for internal module-to-module operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798):** The primary vulnerability is the presence of hard-coded credentials within the source code. This makes it easy for an attacker to obtain these credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to authenticate as the system user.
*   **Configuration Modification:** The attacker can view and modify configurations, including single sign-on (SSO) settings.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can read, add, and modify user data.
*   **Financial Impact:** The attacker can read and transfer fees/fines in a patron's account.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains access to APIs that are intended for internal module use, leading to a significant privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over a network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attack does not require any interaction from a user.
*  **Access to the application:** The attacker needs access to the application's network to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects `org.folio:mod-data-export-spring` versions less than 1.5.4 and versions starting from 2.0.0 up to 2.0.2.
*   The fix involves upgrading the module to version 1.5.4 or later for the 1.x branch, or to version 2.0.2 or later for the 2.x branch.
*   The fix involves retrieving the password from the environment variable `SYSTEM_USER_PASSWORD` and not hardcoding it.
*   The module uses a system user to perform internal module-to-module operations.
*   The system user is created in the post tenant API controller.
*   The password for the system user is set by the `SYSTEM_USER_PASSWORD` environment variable.
*   The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS score of 10.0.
*   The scope is changed due to the impact on resources beyond the component's security scope.
*   The impact on confidentiality and integrity is high.
*   There is no impact on availability.
