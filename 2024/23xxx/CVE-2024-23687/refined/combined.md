# Hard-coded System User Credentials

Critical

[julianladisch](/julianladisch)
published
GHSA-vf78-3q9f-92g3
Jul 24, 2023

## Package

maven

org.folio:mod-data-export-spring
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>=2.0.0, <2.0.2
<1.5.4

## Patched versions

>=2.0.2
>=1.5.4, <1.6.0

## Description

### Impact

The module creates a system user that is used to perform internal module-to-module operations. Credentials for this user are hard-coded in the source code. This makes it trivial to authenticate as this user, resulting in unauthorized access to potentially dangerous APIs, allowing to view and modify configuration including single-sign-on configuration, to read, add and modify user data, and to read and transfer fees/fines in a patron's account.

### Patches

Upgrade mod-data-export-spring to >=2.0.2, or a 1.5.x version >=1.5.4.

### Workarounds

No known workarounds.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

## Hard-coded System User Credentials in Folio Data Export Spring module

Critical severity

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-vf78-3q9f-92g3)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-vf78-3q9f-92g3/dependabot)

## Package

maven

org.folio:mod-data-export-spring
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 2.0.0, < 2.0.2
< 1.5.4

## Patched versions

2.0.2
1.5.4

## Description

### Impact

The module creates a system user that is used to perform internal module-to-module operations. Credentials for this user are hard-coded in the source code. This makes it trivial to authenticate as this user, resulting in unauthorized access to potentially dangerous APIs, allowing to view and modify configuration including single-sign-on configuration, to read, add and modify user data, and to read and transfer fees/fines in a patron's account.

### Patches

Upgrade mod-data-export-spring to >=2.0.2, or a 1.5.x version >=1.5.4.

### Workarounds

No known workarounds.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
