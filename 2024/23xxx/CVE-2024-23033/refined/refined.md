The provided content describes a vulnerability in EyouCMS-V1.6.5, specifically multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application uses the `info` parameter, extracted from the JWT encrypted HEADER of JSON data, to set parameters in the upload form. The application fails to properly sanitize these parameters before using them, allowing for the injection of malicious code. It appears the application replaces "-" with "+" during URL decoding, and doesn't handle standard URL encoding rules properly, which allows an attacker to inject malicious payloads into the JWT and have them reflected in the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the `num`, `input`, `path`, `func`, and `is_water` parameters.
- Improper URL encoding/decoding that allows modification of JWT parameters before being processed.
- Inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- Could lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, and other malicious activities if an administrator views a malicious URL.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is via crafted URLs that contain a malicious payload within the JWT's header, specifically in the `num`, `input`, `path`, `func`, and `is_water` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The victim must access the crafted malicious URL.
- The victim needs to be logged in for the attack to be fully impactful as it allows for cookie theft.
