Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-23771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of `strcmp` to compare passwords in the `darkhttpd` web server. The `strcmp` function will return early if the strings differ, and this timing difference can leak information about the length and content of the password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Timing Side-Channel:** Using `strcmp` for password comparison creates a timing side-channel vulnerability. The time it takes to execute `strcmp` depends on how many characters of the input match the secret. An attacker can exploit this by sending multiple requests with different passwords to learn the password character by character by measuring timing differences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credentials Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially reveal the correct password used for Basic HTTP authentication, allowing them to bypass the authentication mechanism of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Timing Attack:** The attack is performed remotely by sending HTTP requests with different authorization credentials to the server and measuring the time it takes for the server to respond.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the `darkhttpd` server.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the capability to send HTTP requests with different authorization headers to the server and the ability to measure the time it takes for the server to respond.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability replaces `strcmp` with a custom function `password_equal()`, which is designed to have a more constant execution time regardless of the input string. The function iterates through both the user input and secret, performing bitwise XOR operations and checks even after input ends to avoid timing leaks based on input string length.
*   The vulnerability was identified by the SUSE Security Team and a fix was implemented by the project maintainer.
*   The commit fixing this issue is: `f477619d49f3c4de9ad59bd194265a48ddc03f04`
*   The fix is part of version 1.15 of `darkhttpd`.
