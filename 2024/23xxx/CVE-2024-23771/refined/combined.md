1. [Custom headers with the CLI option](/emikulic/darkhttpd/commit/defc1e8ce923e5e1463c35f8a260eea94507f4e6) `[--header](/emikulic/darkhttpd/commit/defc1e8ce923e5e1463c35f8a260eea94507f4e6)` [(](/emikulic/darkhttpd/commit/defc1e8ce923e5e1463c35f8a260eea94507f4e6)[#28](https://github.com/emikulic/darkhttpd/pull/28)[)](/emikulic/darkhttpd/commit/defc1e8ce923e5e1463c35f8a260eea94507f4e6)
    …

   ```
   These changes add a command-line option --header, e.g. --header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'.

   Basic tests are included for this option.

   When accepting the argument, a very simple sanitization is made, the string is required to contain ": ", and can’t contain a '\n' character. These checks are far from what is required to truly validate a HTTP header, but will at least detect simple mistakes and forbid the abuse of having arguments that include more than one header, or, worse, that include a body for the response (after "\r\n\r\n").

   This should also close the Issue [#16](https://github.com/emikulic/darkhttpd/issues/16) and PR [#27](https://github.com/emikulic/darkhttpd/pull/27), I think, since CORS functionality can be obtained by specifying a custom header.
