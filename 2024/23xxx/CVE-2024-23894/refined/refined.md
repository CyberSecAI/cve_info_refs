The provided content is related to CVE-2024-23894.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient encoding of user-controlled inputs within the Cups Easy (Purchase & Inventory) application. This lack of proper encoding allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied data before including it in the HTML output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit these XSS vulnerabilities by crafting malicious URLs. If a legitimate, authenticated user clicks on such a URL, the attacker could steal their session cookie credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access to the application and further malicious activity.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially crafted URL sent to an authenticated user. The vulnerable parameter is `issuancedate` within the `/cupseasylive/stockissuancecreate.php` path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL containing a payload that will be executed in the context of a logged-in user's session. The attacker needs to entice a logged in user to click on this crafted URL.
