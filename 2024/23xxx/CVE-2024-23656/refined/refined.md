  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided content details a vulnerability in Dex v2.37.0 where the TLS configuration is not correctly applied, leading to the exposure of insecure TLS versions and ciphers. This matches the description for CVE-2024-23656.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is that the TLS configuration logic was broken by the introduction of a TLS certificate reloader in pull request #2964. The reloader overwrites the TLS configuration set previously, effectively ignoring the intended minimum TLS version and cipher suites set in the configuration.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The primary weakness is the improper handling of the TLS configuration, specifically the failure to apply the specified minimum TLS version and cipher suites.",
        "The vulnerability exposes the service to deprecated TLS 1.0 and 1.1 protocols as well as weak cipher suites."
      ],
      "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker can potentially intercept and decrypt traffic to the Dex service, compromising the confidentiality of the data being transmitted. Exploitation is possible due to the service serving traffic over insecure TLS versions and weak cipher suites.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can intercept the network traffic between a client and the Dex server.",
         "By using a tool like `sslyze`, it is possible to identify that TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are enabled and vulnerable cipher suites can be used."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic to exploit this vulnerability. They do not need any credentials or prior access to the system.",
       "additional_details": "The advisory provides a detailed PoC using `sslyze` to demonstrate the vulnerability. It also shows the difference in behavior between vulnerable Dex v2.37.0 and the previous v2.36.0."
