Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute higher-privileged actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is a broken access control issue, stemming from insufficient checks on user privileges before allowing access to certain functionalities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unprivileged user (specifically mentioned as a "Subscriber" role in WordPress) could potentially execute actions that should be limited to higher-privileged users. The specific impact is case-by-case.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector would likely involve a subscriber user attempting to execute a function or action that requires higher privileges. This is achieved by bypassing the expected authorization/authentication/nonce token mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a subscriber level account on the WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as low severity with a CVSS score of 4.3.
*   The vulnerability affects versions of the "Order Tracking" WordPress plugin prior to 3.3.13.
