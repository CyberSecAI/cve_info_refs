## Package

gomod

https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

1.31.1

## Patched versions

1.33.0

## Description

### Impact

Existing lakeFS users who have issued credentials to users who have been deleted.

Creating a new user with the same username, that user will inherit all of the previous user's credentials

lakeFS needs to delete user credentials upon user deletion.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

### Workarounds

A possible workaround will be not to reuse usernames that were previously deleted

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
