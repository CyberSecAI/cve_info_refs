The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe, and it includes information about CVE-2024-43738.

**Vulnerability Details for CVE-2024-43738:**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are later executed in the context of other users' browsers.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can potentially execute malicious code within the user's browser, which could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through a vulnerable input field. When another user accesses the injected content, the script is executed in their browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a user with low privileges who can provide the malicious input and a user has to interact with the injected code for execution.
