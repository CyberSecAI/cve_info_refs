**CVE-2024-43745**

*   **Root cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts into the application's data store.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or further malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. An attacker could inject malicious scripts via a vulnerable input field or parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  A low privileged attacker is required to inject the malicious script and a user must be tricked to visit the infected page.
