- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the Envira Photo Gallery plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control. Specifically, a lack of proper authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user could execute actions that require higher privileges. The specific impact varies based on the affected function but generally could allow modification or deletion of content.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is within the WordPress plugin, so a network attacker could trigger the vulnerable function by making a request to the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site. The minimum required privilege is "Contributor".
