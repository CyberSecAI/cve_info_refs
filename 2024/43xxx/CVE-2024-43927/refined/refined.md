- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Email Address Encoder plugin, versions 1.0.23 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions on the WordPress site, using their current authentication. The specific impact varies depending on the context and actions the plugin facilitates.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a CSRF attack, where a malicious actor tricks a logged-in user into performing actions on the WordPress site without their knowledge or consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in user into triggering it. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated on the target WordPress site, but the victim does.
