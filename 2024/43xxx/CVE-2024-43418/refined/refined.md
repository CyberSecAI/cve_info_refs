- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unspecified reflected XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can execute malicious scripts in a GLPI technician's browser by crafting a malicious link. This can lead to unauthorized access or actions performed under the technician's session.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious link provided by the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL. The attacker does not require authentication. User interaction (clicking the crafted link) is required by a logged-in GLPI technician.
