Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the Memberpress WordPress plugin. This lack of proper access control allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is a failure to enforce proper authorization, allowing unauthorized access to privileged functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The specific impact is not detailed, but the general description suggests that unprivileged users can execute higher-privileged actions. This could lead to various issues depending on the function that's vulnerable, including data modification, access to sensitive information, or even complete site takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is likely exploited via the vulnerable function, which lacks proper access controls. The exact method would depend on the specific code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, according to the "Required privilege" field which is set to "Unauthenticated".
*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable function or endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.5 and is considered a "low" priority by Patchstack, it is unlikely to be exploited.
*   The vulnerability affects Memberpress plugin versions 1.11.34 and earlier.
*   The fix is available in version 1.11.35.
