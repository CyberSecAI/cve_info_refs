Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the improper use of an interpolated variable in a raw SQL statement within the `admin_role_actions` method of `papertrail/version-model(app/models/decidim/decidim_awesome/paper_trail_version.rb)`. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The core issue is that user-supplied input (`params[:admin_role_type]`) is directly embedded into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Escalation of Privileges:** The vulnerability allows an attacker with admin permissions to potentially elevate their privileges.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could read sensitive data from the database.
- **File System Access:** Attackers could read and write files on the file system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack can be carried out remotely.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted request to the `/admin/decidim_awesome/admin_accountability` endpoint. The `admin_role_type` parameter within the request is used to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within the Decidim application.
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the application.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in the `admin_role_actions` method within `app/models/decidim/decidim_awesome/paper_trail_version.rb`.
- The vulnerable code uses the `object_changes LIKE` clause with user-provided input, which is directly interpolated into a raw SQL statement.
- The proof of concept provided shows how a crafted `admin_role_type` parameter value can trigger an SQL error, indicating the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists in versions including v0.11.1 of the `decidim-decidim_awesome` module.
- Patched versions are >= 0.10.3 and >= 0.11.2.

The provided patch includes:
- Sanitization of user input by utilizing `PaperTrailVersion.safe_admin_role_type` to ensure that the `admin_role_type` is a valid user role before being used in the SQL query.
- Using parameterized queries with `?` placeholder to prevent SQL injection by using `base.where("object_changes LIKE ?", "%\nroles:\n- []\n- - #{filter}\n%")` instead of string interpolation.
- Modifications in `filterable_helper.rb` and `admin_accountability_controller.rb` to use the `safe_admin_role_type` method.
- Adding a test case to `paper_trail_version_spec.rb` to ignore invalid filters.
