The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe, which includes details for CVE-2024-43740.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could result in arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The attack requires a low privilege user (PR:L) to initiate the attack via a user interaction (UI:R). The scope is changed (S:C), which suggests that the injected script can affect other users of the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have low privileges and needs to trick a user into interacting with the injected malicious content to execute the stored XSS attack.
