This document provides details on multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2024-43751.

**CVE-2024-43751**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored and later executed when other users access the affected page.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors:** Network access, where the attacker injects malicious script through a vulnerable input field in the application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker with low privileges (PR:L) can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts that are stored on the server, which are then executed when a user visits the page. User interaction is required (UI:R) for the XSS to be triggered.
