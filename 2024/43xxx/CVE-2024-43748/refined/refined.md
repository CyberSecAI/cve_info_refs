The provided document is an Adobe security bulletin that includes information about CVE-2024-43748.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS). This occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided input before storing it, allowing malicious scripts to be stored and executed when other users access the data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability can result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), with a low attack complexity (AC:L), requiring a low privilege user (PR:L), and user interaction (UI:R). The scope is changed (S:C) meaning an attacker may be able to affect other components of the system
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low-privileged attacker is required to inject malicious scripts via the vulnerable application, which are then stored on the server. The attack requires user interaction to trigger the execution of the stored malicious script, which could be done by an administrator or other user within the AEM system.
