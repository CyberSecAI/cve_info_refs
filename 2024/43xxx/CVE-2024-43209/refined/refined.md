Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The WordPress Bitly Plugin (versions <= 2.7.2) suffers from a broken access control vulnerability due to a missing authorization, authentication or nonce token check in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that should be restricted to higher privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks, enabling unauthorized access to functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An unauthenticated attacker can potentially execute higher-privileged actions. The specific impact will depend on the vulnerable function that can be accessed and manipulated.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges or authentication. They can be an unauthenticated user of the WordPress site.
