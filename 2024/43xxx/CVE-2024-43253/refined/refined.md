- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute privileged actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken Access Control, specifically a lack of proper checks to prevent unauthorized access to functions within the plugin.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The impact is described as low severity and unlikely to be exploited. However, the general impact of broken access control is that an attacker can perform actions they shouldn't be authorized to perform.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, meaning an attacker doesn't need to have an account on the WordPress site to exploit it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable functions of the plugin.
