Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a **Broken Access Control** issue, specifically a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function. This allows unprivileged users to execute actions that require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper access control mechanisms, such as authorization checks or nonce verification. This means that the system doesn't correctly verify if a user has the necessary permissions to perform a certain action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user can execute actions that they should not have access to, leading to potential unauthorized modification of data, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities.
- The specific impact is case-dependent but this is generally considered highly dangerous and likely to be mass exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, meaning they do not need any login or credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no prior privileges or authentication.
- They simply need to be able to access the vulnerable functionality in the WpTravelly plugin.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the WpTravelly plugin up to and including 1.7.7.
- A fix is available in version 1.7.8.
- Patchstack has issued a virtual patch to mitigate the issue while users update.
- The vulnerability is classified as a "High" severity issue with a CVSS score of 7.5.
- This issue is considered part of the OWASP Top 10 A1 category (Broken Access Control).
