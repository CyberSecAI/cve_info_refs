- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin has a broken access control issue, meaning it lacks proper authorization, authentication, or nonce token checks in a function. This allows an unprivileged user to execute a higher privileged action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unprivileged user can execute actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges. The specific impact will vary depending on the function that's vulnerable.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to exploit the missing authorization, authentication or nonce token check in a function of the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user of the WordPress site, with the role of "subscriber" or lower.
