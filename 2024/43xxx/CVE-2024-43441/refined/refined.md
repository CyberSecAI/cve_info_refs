- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an "Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data" issue. This implies that the application incorrectly assumed certain data, likely the JWT secret key, to be immutable, which led to a way to bypass authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the incorrect assumption of immutability of the JWT secret, leading to an authentication bypass vulnerability. This means that attackers might be able to generate valid JWT tokens without knowing the intended secret.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the application and its data, which could result in data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities depending on the application's functionalities and the privileges associated with the bypassed authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is likely through the manipulation or exposure of the JWT signing secret.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to exploit the weakness to generate valid JWT tokens. This might involve obtaining or deriving the secret or leveraging a weakness in the way it's handled.
