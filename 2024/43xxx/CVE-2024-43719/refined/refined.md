The provided content is related to CVE-2024-43719.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) issue in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).
*   **Weaknesses:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
*  **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring low privileges (PR:L) and user interaction (UI:R). The scope of the vulnerability is changed (S:C), meaning an attacker can inject malicious content that will execute in the context of another user.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need to have low privileges within the AEM application and be able to inject malicious code, which a victim would then need to interact with by triggering the XSS.

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**Affected Product:**
* Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)
  * AEM Cloud Service (CS)
  * 6.5.21 and earlier versions

**Solution:**
