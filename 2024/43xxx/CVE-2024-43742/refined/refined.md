The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), including CVE-2024-43742.

**CVE-2024-43742**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS)
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper handling of user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored and executed when other users access the affected content.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. When a user interacts with the stored malicious script, it executes within their browser context. This could allow an attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, perform actions on behalf of the user, or potentially gain further access to the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A remote attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application that will be stored. When a user interacts with the affected area in the application, the injected script is executed in the user's browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to store malicious scripts in the application. In most cases, this requires a low-privileged user account. User interaction (clicking, viewing) is also required.
