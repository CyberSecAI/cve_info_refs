Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.5.21 and earlier are affected by a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser session. By manipulating the DOM environment in the victim's browser, an attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed by the victim's browser. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction, typically in the form of following a malicious link.
