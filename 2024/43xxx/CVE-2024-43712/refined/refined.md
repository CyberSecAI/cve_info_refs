The provided content is related to CVE-2024-43712.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability occurs when user-supplied input is stored and later displayed without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser. This could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user or steal sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring low privileges (PR:L) and user interaction (UI:R). The attacker needs to store malicious scripts within the application. When a user views the stored content containing this malicious script, the code is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires low privileges to store malicious content and needs to trick the user into viewing the stored content. The attacker doesn't need to be in a privileged position.
