- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization which leads to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to inject malicious scripts into the application which are then stored and executed when another user interacts with the injected content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low-privileged access (PR:L) and the victim has to interact with the malicious content (UI:R). The attack is performed over the network (AV:N), with low complexity (AC:L) and the scope is changed (S:C).
