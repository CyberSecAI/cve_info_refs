- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the Microsoft Excel application for macOS having the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement set to true. This disables the Hardened Runtime's library validation, allowing the loading of unsigned dynamic libraries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature (CWE-347).
    -  Library injection due to disabled library validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject a malicious library into Microsoft Excel and leverage Excel's extensive entitlements to:
    - Send emails via Microsoft Outlook.
    - Access the user's Pictures folder.
    - Exfiltrate sensitive data.
    - Potentially perform other actions authorized by Excel's entitlements.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker needs to copy the Microsoft Excel application to a controllable location.
    - The attacker then injects a malicious dynamic library into the application.
    -  Executing the modified application triggers the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
    - The attacker needs to be able to copy and modify the Microsoft Excel application.
    - The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious library.
