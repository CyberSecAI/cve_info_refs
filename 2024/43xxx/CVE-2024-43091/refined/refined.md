   "details": "The vulnerability lies in Skia component. The original fix landed after SkMaskBuilder was introduced. This cherry-pick had to be tweaked to avoid conflicts and thus requires RESTRICT AUTOMERGE to prevent the modified version from flowing through API boundaries into VULKAN ICD.  It requires manual cherry-picking to each API level."
