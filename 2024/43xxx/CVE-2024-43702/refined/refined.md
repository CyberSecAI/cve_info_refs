{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to writable MLIST/PM render state buffers, which allows arbitrary writes to kernel memory pages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper GPU system calls",
      "Unprivileged access to arbitrary physical memory pages"
    ],
    "impact": "A non-privileged user can gain access to arbitrary physical memory pages by exploiting the improperly writable buffers.",
    "attack_vectors": "Improper GPU system calls",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a non-privileged user with the ability to execute GPU system calls."
