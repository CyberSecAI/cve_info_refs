The provided content is related to CVE-2024-43723.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Vulnerability Category:** Cross-site Scripting (Stored XSS) [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Severity:** Important
*   **CVSS base score:** 5.4
*   **CVSS vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
*   **Affected Product:** Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)
    *   AEM Cloud Service (CS)
    *   6.5.21 and earlier versions

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which arises from the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input that is later displayed on a web page.

**Weaknesses:**
The primary weakness is the failure to properly validate or sanitize user input before storing it and subsequently rendering it in the application's interface. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the system, which can then be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they interact with the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of a user's browser session. This could enable attackers to perform actions such as:

*   Session hijacking.
*   Stealing sensitive information, including credentials, cookies, or tokens.
*   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
*   Modifying the content of the web page.
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a field, that is later displayed on a page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) to inject the malicious code.
*   The attacker needs a user to interact with the injected content (UI:R).
*   The scope is changed (S:C) meaning that the attack is executed in the context of a different user.
*   The attacker does not require high attack complexity (AC:L).
