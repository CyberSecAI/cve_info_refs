{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The webdriver for the Browser object does not allocate memory for the data pointer when downloading data from an HTTP server. Memory is only allocated in the curl_write_cb callback when data is received.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Data pointer is initialized to NULL and only allocated upon receiving data from the HTTP server.",
      "Lack of proper handling of empty HTTP server responses."
    ],
    "impact": "Crash due to NULL pointer dereference when an empty response is received from the HTTP server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can cause a crash by sending an empty HTTP server response when the Zabbix browser object is trying to download data."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to control the HTTP server that the Zabbix browser object is connecting to.",
       "Ability to send a malicious (empty) HTTP response."
    ]
  },
  "additional_notes": "This vulnerability occurs within the context of Zabbix browser object interacting with an HTTP server and can be triggered by a trivial, yet malicious, empty HTTP response."
