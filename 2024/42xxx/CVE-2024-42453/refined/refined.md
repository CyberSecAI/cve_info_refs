Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-42453:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls within the Veeam Backup & Replication software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authenticated users with specific roles (assigned via "Users and Roles settings") on the backup server are able to modify the configuration of connected virtual infrastructure hosts. This indicates an improper authorization mechanism that allows users with limited roles to perform actions that should require higher privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with the necessary role can control and modify the configuration of the connected virtual infrastructure hosts. This could include changes to critical settings that could disrupt operations, introduce vulnerabilities, or allow further unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based and requires a user to be authenticated to the Veeam Backup & Replication server with specific permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with a role assigned in the "Users and Roles settings" on the Veeam Backup & Replication server, which grants the necessary level of access to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is classified as "High" severity with a CVSS v3.1 score of 8.8 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
- The vulnerability affects Veeam Backup & Replication version 12.2.0.334 and all earlier builds of version 12.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal testing.
- Mitigation involves removing untrusted or unnecessary users from the "Users and Roles settings" until the server is upgraded to version 12.3.
