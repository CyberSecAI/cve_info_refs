A vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication allows a low-privileged user to connect to remoting services and exploit insecure deserialization by sending a serialized temporary file collection. This exploit allows the attacker to delete any file on the system with service account privileges. The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient blacklist during the deserialization process.
