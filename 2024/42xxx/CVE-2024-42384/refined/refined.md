- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer Overflow or Wraparound.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An integer overflow or wraparound vulnerability exists in the Cesanta Mongoose Web Server library, version 7.14.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can send a specially crafted TLS packet, triggering the vulnerability, and causing a segmentation fault, leading to a denial of service on the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker sends a crafted TLS packet to the vulnerable server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server; no specific capabilities or authentication is required.
