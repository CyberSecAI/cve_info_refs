- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use of an out-of-range pointer offset.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending an unexpected TLS packet to the Mongoose Web Server, causing the application to read unintended heap memory space due to an out-of-range pointer offset.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can force the application to read unintended heap memory.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending an unexpected TLS packet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic (specifically crafted TLS packets) to the vulnerable service. No prior authentication or special privileges are required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Mongoose Web Server v7.14
- CVSS score is 5.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
