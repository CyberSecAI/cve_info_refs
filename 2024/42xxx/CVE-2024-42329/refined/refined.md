{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The webdriver for the Browser object does not properly handle cases where the webdriver_session_query function fails without an error description, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "NULL pointer dereference. The webdriver's code attempts to read from `wd->error` without ensuring it's not NULL after a failed `webdriver_session_query` call.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Crash of the Zabbix server process.",
  "Attack vectors": "Triggering a scenario where the webdriver_session_query fails without an error description which causes the webdriver to access a NULL pointer.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to cause the webdriver to fail without an error description (e.g. by providing invalid parameters or sending malicious http request). Specific information on how to achieve this is not given."
