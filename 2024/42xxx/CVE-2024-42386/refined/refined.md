- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset in the Mongoose Web Server library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-range pointer offset.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can send an unexpected TLS packet, leading to a segmentation fault on the application, causing denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending an unexpected TLS packet to the vulnerable server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server.
