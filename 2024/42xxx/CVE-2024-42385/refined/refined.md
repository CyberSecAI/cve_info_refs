Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization of delimiters in the Mongoose Web Server library when processing PEM certificates. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when a PEM certificate contains unexpected characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds memory write due to the improper handling of delimiters in PEM certificate parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An out-of-bounds memory write can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or other undefined behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a crafted PEM certificate with unexpected characters to the Mongoose Web Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PEM certificate to the vulnerable Mongoose Web Server.
- The CVSS score indicates the attacker needs high privileges on the local machine, and user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Mongoose Web Server v7.14
- The provided content includes a CVSS score of 4.0 with the vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
- The suggested solution is to not expose the vulnerable component inside an untrusted network.
