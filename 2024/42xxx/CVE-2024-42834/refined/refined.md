- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the customerManager API and ManageAccount_retrieve modules of the Incognito Service Activation Center User Interface (SAC UI). Specifically, the 'lastName' parameter is not sanitized properly.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML, which will be stored on the web server and triggered on users' browsers when they view the affected page, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious JavaScript or HTML via the `lastName` parameter through the customerManager API. This malicious code is then stored on the server. The XSS is triggered when a user views the affected account on the `ManageAccount_retrieve` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be remotely authenticated to the SAC UI to be able to exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code via the `lastName` parameter.
