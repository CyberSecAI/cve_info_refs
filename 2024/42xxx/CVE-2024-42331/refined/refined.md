- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A use-after-free vulnerability occurs due to a heap pointer being freed by garbage collection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free vulnerability. The `wd->browser` heap pointer is freed by garbage collection, and a stale pointer is used later, leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact is not explicitly stated, but use-after-free vulnerabilities can potentially lead to crashes, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability occurs within the Zabbix server's embedded JavaScript engine (Duktape). An attacker would likely need to influence or control the JavaScript code executed by the Zabbix server to trigger the garbage collection in a way that causes the use-after-free.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to influence the JavaScript code executed by the Zabbix server and trigger the garbage collection mechanism that leads to this vulnerability.
