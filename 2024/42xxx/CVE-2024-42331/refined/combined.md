### Description

In the src/libs/zbxembed/browser.c file, the es\_browser\_ctor method retrieves a heap pointer from the Duktape JavaScript engine. This heap pointer is subsequently utilized by the browser\_push\_error method in the src/libs/zbxembed/browser\_error.c file. A use-after-free bug can occur at this stage if the wd->browser heap pointer is freed by garbage collection.
