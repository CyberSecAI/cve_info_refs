- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to send an unexpected TLS packet, which causes the application to read unintended heap memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can force the application to read unintended heap memory.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending unexpected TLS packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server. No specific level of access is mentioned, meaning a remote attacker on the network can trigger the vulnerability. The UI is listed as "R", meaning that user interaction is required, but it is unclear in what form.
