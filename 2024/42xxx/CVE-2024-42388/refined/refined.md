- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use of out-of-range pointer offset.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to the use of an out-of-range pointer offset within the Mongoose Web Server library. This allows an attacker to send a crafted TLS packet and force the application to read heap memory that it should not have access to.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can send an unexpected TLS packet that forces the application to read unintended heap memory space. This results in information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted TLS packet to the affected Mongoose Web Server application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.
