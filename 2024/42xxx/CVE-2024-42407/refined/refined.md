Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insertion of sensitive information into log files within the Gallagher Command Centre Alarm Transmitter feature. Specifically, the issue arises when using the CSV protocol.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File**: The system is logging sensitive data that should not be exposed in the log files. This includes data that an authenticated operator would not normally have access to.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated operator could potentially view sensitive security information that they are not authorized to access. This could lead to a compromise of security within the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Alarm Transmitter feature specifically when using the CSV protocol. An attacker would need to be an authenticated operator on the system to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have valid operator credentials within the Gallagher Command Centre.
- The attacker must be able to utilize the Alarm Transmitter feature with the CSV protocol.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the log files where the sensitive information is recorded.

**Affected components and versions:**
- Command Centre Server
  - 9.10 prior to 9.10.2149 (MR4)
  - 9.00 prior to 9.00.2374 (MR5)
  - 8.90 prior to 8.90.2356 (MR6)
  - All versions of 8.80 and prior

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Only sites using the Alarm Transmitter feature with the CSV protocol are susceptible to this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity.
- There is no known active exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of the advisory publication.
- Maintenance releases are available to address the issue.
