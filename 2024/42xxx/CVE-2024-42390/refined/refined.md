- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use of an out-of-range pointer offset when processing TLS packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An out-of-bounds read due to an incorrect pointer offset when processing a specific TLS packet.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can send a crafted TLS packet which forces the application to read unintended heap memory space. This could lead to information disclosure, and potentially other attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted TLS packet to the vulnerable Mongoose Web Server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the server. No authentication is mentioned, implying the vulnerability could be exploited remotely without prior access.
