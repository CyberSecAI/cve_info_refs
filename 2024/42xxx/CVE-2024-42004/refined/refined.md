- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlement being set to true in Microsoft Teams for macOS, which disables the application's defense against dynamic library hijacking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper verification of cryptographic signature (CWE-347) by disabling library validation.
    - Dynamic library injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious application can inject a crafted library into Microsoft Teams, which would then run with the same permissions as Teams. This could allow the attacker to:
    - Bypass security permissions.
    - Take pictures, record audio, exfiltrate data.
    - Leverage existing permissions granted to Teams.
    - Potentially trick users into granting new permissions.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A malicious application needs to be present on the same system as the vulnerable Microsoft Teams application.
    - The attacker copies the Microsoft Teams application to a location where they have control.
    - The attacker injects a malicious library into the application.
    - The attacker starts the program to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to place files on the target macOS system.
    - Ability to copy the Microsoft Teams application to a controlled location.
    - Ability to create a malicious dynamic library.
    - Ability to execute the modified Microsoft Teams application.
