PowerLogic PM5300 Series

12 November 2024

Overview

Schneider Electric is aware of a vulnerability in its PowerLogic PM5300 series with ethernet functionality.

PowerLogic  PM5300  series  offers  a  compact,  versatile  power  meter  for  energy  cost  and  basic  network
management applications.

Failure to apply the remediation below may risk loss of communication to the device leading to a denial of
service.

Note – PM5310 and PM5330 are not impacted because they use serial communication infrastructure and do
not have an Ethernet stack.

Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2024-9409

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 7.5 | High | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
CVSS v4.0 Base Score 8.7 | High | CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

CWE-400: An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability exists that could cause the device to become
unresponsive resulting in communication loss when a large amount of IGMP packets is present in the network.

The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the CVSS Base metrics for 4.0 (CVSS v4.0). CVSS v3.1
will be still evaluated until the adoption of CVSS v4.0 by the industry. The severity was calculated without
incorporating the Temporal and Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric recommends that customers score
the CVSS Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user organizations, and consider factors such as
the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental metrics may refine the relative severity posed
by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a customer’s environment.

Customers should use appropriate patching methodologies when applying these patches to their systems. We
strongly recommend the use of back-ups and evaluating the impact of these patches in a Test and
Development environment or on an offline infrastructure. Contact Schneider Electric’s Customer Care Center if
you need assistance removing a patch.

If customers choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately apply the following
steps to reduce the risk of exploit:

1.  Enable IGMP Snooping:

o  Ensure that IGMP Snooping is enabled on the switch. This feature allows the switch to

intelligently forward multicast traffic only to the necessary ports where interested hosts reside. It
prevents unnecessary flooding of multicast traffic across all ports, thereby enhancing network
efficiency and minimizing unnecessary load on network resources.

2.  Configure VLAN Interface Settings:

o  Set up VLAN interface settings on the switch. It's important to have distinct configurations for

each VLAN to ensure proper IGMP operation.

3.  Multicast Filtering:

o  Use IGMP filtering to control the propagation of IGMP traffic through the network. This involves
configuring filters on a switch virtual interface (SVI), per-port, or per-port per-VLAN basis.
Multicast filtering helps manage IGMP snooping and controls multicast traffic forwarding
effectively.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from

•

the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety
systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.
•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc.

before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.

•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to

connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.

•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not

accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version
available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.

For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document.
