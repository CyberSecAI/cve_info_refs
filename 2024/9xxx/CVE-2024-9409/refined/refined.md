- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability exists in the PowerLogic PM5300 series devices when a large number of IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) packets are present on the network.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can cause the device to become unresponsive, leading to a loss of communication, which constitutes a denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network traffic by sending a large number of IGMP packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network or have the ability to send network traffic (IGMP) to the vulnerable device. No authentication or privileges are required.
