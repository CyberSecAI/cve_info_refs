### Description

The LSX Tour Operator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.

great plugin which has most functionalities that a tour operator wants..including reviews!
We’ve subsequently moved to a 3rd party review platform but still make use for now of ‘reviews’ within the Tour Operator theme.

Tour operators and travel personnel will find the tour operator plugin a perfect fit. Easy to use and very versatile with good back up and support when required. There has been a lot research gone into the plugin which makes it functional and relative especially to the travel industry.

### [Excellent Plugin for Tour Operator & Travel Industry players](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-plugin-for-tour-operator-travel-industry-players/)

July 12, 2018

The Plugin is well-thought-out with all elements (accommodation, itineraries, destination etc..) we needed to advertise our business; with that comes a great responsive theme with addition of rich media (video, large banners etc..) where relevant.
The Tour Operator plugin is also constantly maintained which is great!
It’s super fast, no php issues either.

Pros:
It seems to have a lot of different applications and uses.
Cons:
I would love to use this but with no documentation on using it in different applications makes it very difficult to use.
An example is please post in the description that it requires PHP 7.0 or better or it will crash the site. I uploaded and deleted it several times before finding a post that mentions the requirment of 7.0 or better.

Had to uninstall it right away, because it did not work with my theme. This plugin REQUIRES you to use the theme that they mention in the description. Although they only say it “Works well with” – After installation it give you message saying you must use their theme. Further, when I installed it, they gave separate warnings that said “If you get header errors, disable this plugin.” Doesn’t really have any business on the plugin repository if it doesn’t even work.

This plugin helped me to build a great tour operator site. It does exactly what needs to be done, and works perfectly with the free LSX theme. Great job!
