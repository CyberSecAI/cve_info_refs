  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of PDF files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation when parsing PDF files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to disclose sensitive information. In conjunction with other vulnerabilities it could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to lure the target into opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious page. No special privileges are required."
