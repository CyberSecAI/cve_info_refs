### CVE-2024-9386

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling SVG file uploads within the "Exclusive Divi – Divi Preloader, Modules for Divi & Extra Theme" WordPress plugin. The plugin allows for SVG uploads if the 'svg-upload' option is enabled in the plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This occurs because the plugin doesn't properly sanitize SVG files, allowing malicious scripts to be embedded within them. When a user accesses a page containing a compromised SVG, the malicious script executes in their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary web scripts within the context of the user's browser.
*   **Website Compromise:** This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Stealing sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens)
    *   Modifying the content of the website
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the context and the script injected, it could potentially allow an attacker to gain higher privileges on the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** The attack vector is through the upload of a malicious SVG file.
*   **Plugin Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the "Exclusive Divi – Divi Preloader, Modules for Divi & Extra Theme" plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with at least author-level access (or higher) to the WordPress site. This is because the SVG upload functionality is available to users with these roles.
*   **Access to Upload Functionality:** The attacker must have the ability to upload files through the WordPress media library.
*   **'svg-upload' Enabled:** The 'svg-upload' option needs to be enabled in the plugin settings for the malicious SVG file to be uploaded.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The plugin has been closed and is not available for download on WordPress.org due to the security issue.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the plugin up to and including 1.4.
*   No patch is available. The recommended mitigation is to uninstall the plugin.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `public/script-handler.php` file, specifically the `edm_svgs_upload_check` function starting on line 62 which checks the file type, and the  `edm_enable_mime_types` function on line 82, which adds SVG mime types.
