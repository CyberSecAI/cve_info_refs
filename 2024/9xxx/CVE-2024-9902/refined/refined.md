{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The ansible-core `user` module allows an unprivileged user to create or replace files and take ownership of them when a privileged user executes the module targeting the unprivileged user's home directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
        "Insufficient file permissions checks"
     ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged user can silently create or replace any file on the system and take ownership of it, potentially leading to privilege escalation or arbitrary code execution if the file is a configuration or executable used by a privileged process.",
    "attack_vectors": "A privileged user executes the `user` module with the `generate_ssh_key` option targeting an unprivileged user's home directory. The unprivileged user must have traversal permissions on the directory containing the targeted file.",
    "required_capabilities": "An unprivileged user with traversal permissions within their home directory, and a privileged user who executes the ansible user module with `generate_ssh_key` targeting the unprivileged user."
