{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin uses the `add_query_arg` function without proper sanitization or escaping when constructing URLs. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script via URL parameters.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could be used to steal cookies, session data, perform actions on behalf of the victim, redirect to malicious sites, or deface the website.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with a JavaScript payload as a parameter, and then tricking a victim into visiting that URL.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not require any privileges on the target system and needs to convince a user to click the malicious link."
