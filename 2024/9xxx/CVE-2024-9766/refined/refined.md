{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists in the WTabletServicePro process, where a symbolic link can be created by an attacker to abuse the service and create a file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of symbolic links within the WTabletServicePro process.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system is required to create a symbolic link. The attacker needs to be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must first have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system."
