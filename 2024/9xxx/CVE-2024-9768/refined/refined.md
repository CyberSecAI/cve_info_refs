Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9768

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user input within the "CSS Layout Classes" parameter of the Formidable Forms WordPress plugin. This allows an attacker to inject and store malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means the malicious script is saved on the server and executed when a user (admin or visitor) interacts with the affected element, such as previewing a form.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the failure of the plugin to sanitize or escape user input in the `CSS Layout Classes` field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Backdoor Creation:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript payloads to create backdoors, potentially compromising site security, and gaining administrative control.
*   **Data Exposure:**  Sensitive user data can be exposed.
*   **Cookie Theft:** An attacker can potentially steal cookies, hijacking user sessions.
*   **Website Defacement:** The website can be defaced with malicious content
*   **Administrative Control:** Attackers can gain administrative control over affected websites

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker exploits the vulnerable `CSS Layout Classes` setting.
*   The malicious payload is stored in the form's settings within the WordPress database.
*   The XSS payload is triggered when the form is previewed, executing the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs administrative access to the WordPress site to access the Formidable Forms plugin settings.
*   They require the ability to create or edit forms within the Formidable Forms plugin.

**Technical Details**
1.  The attacker navigates to the Formidable Forms plugin settings.
2.  They create a new form or edit an existing one.
3.  In the form editor, they locate the `CSS Layout Classes` field.
4.  They insert a malicious JavaScript payload, e.g., `123123"onmouseover='alert(1)'`.
5.  The form is saved, storing the malicious code in the database.
6.  When a user previews the form using a URL like `http://host.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=frm_forms_preview&form={name_forms}`, the injected JavaScript executes.

**Additional Information**
* The vulnerability is present in Formidable Forms versions prior to 6.14.1.
* The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 3.5 (low).
* The vulnerability was discovered by Artyom Krugov.
*  The vulnerability was publicly published on September 16, 2024.
