- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PSD files, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious PSD file that the target user must open or visit a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PSD file to the target user or lure them to a malicious page. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
