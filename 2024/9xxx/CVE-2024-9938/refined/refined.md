- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'page' parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that will execute in a user's browser if the user clicks a malicious link. This could lead to the attacker performing actions on behalf of the user or stealing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious link that contains the attacker's payload in the 'page' parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker is unauthenticated and must trick a user into clicking on the crafted malicious link.
