- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper initialization of memory prior to accessing it during the parsing of SKP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uninitialized variable usage.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious SKP file. The target must open this file, or visit a malicious page to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious SKP file to the victim. User interaction is required in the form of opening the malicious file or visiting a malicious page.
