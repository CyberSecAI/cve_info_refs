- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Jetpack plugin lacks proper authorization checks in one of its REST endpoints.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect authorization leading to broken access control. Specifically, the `/wp/v2/feedback` REST endpoint allows any authenticated user, including subscribers, to read arbitrary feedback data submitted through Jetpack Contact Forms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with subscriber-level access can read sensitive feedback data submitted via Jetpack Contact Forms. This data could include personal information, private communications, or other confidential details.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed via a REST API endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid account on the WordPress site with at least subscriber-level privileges. They also need to be able to use the browser's web console to execute JavaScript code.
