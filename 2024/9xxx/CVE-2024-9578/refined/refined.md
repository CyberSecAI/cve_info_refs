- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization, arbitrary shortcode execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary shortcodes available on the target site. This can potentially lead to various malicious actions depending on the shortcodes available, such as arbitrary code execution, data manipulation, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by submitting a crafted comment containing a malicious shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated attackers can exploit the vulnerability. They require no specific capabilities other than being able to submit a comment to the affected website.
