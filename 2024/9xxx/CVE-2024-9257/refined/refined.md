{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied filename within the delete_gsuite_key_file endpoint before using it in file operations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient input validation leading to arbitrary file deletion.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can delete arbitrary files within sensitive directories on affected installations.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote network access to the vulnerable endpoint after authentication.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires a valid user account with access to the delete_gsuite_key_file endpoint."
