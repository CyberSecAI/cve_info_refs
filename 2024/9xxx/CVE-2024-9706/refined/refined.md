Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `ucsm_activate_lite_template_lite` function in the Ultimate Coming Soon & Maintenance WordPress plugin lacks a capability check, allowing unauthenticated users to call it via AJAX.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the absence of a proper authorization check within the `ucsm_activate_lite_template_lite` function. This function is responsible for activating a specific template for the coming soon/maintenance page.
*   **Insecure AJAX Handling:** The function is hooked to `wp_ajax_activate_template` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_activate_template`, which means it's accessible to both logged-in and non-logged-in users without proper verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Template Modification:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to change the template used for the coming soon or maintenance page. This allows them to alter the site's appearance when it is in maintenance mode or showing a coming soon page.
*   **Potential for Phishing/Malicious Content:** While the direct impact is template modification, an attacker could potentially upload or select a template that displays malicious content, redirects users to phishing sites, or performs other harmful actions. The provided information doesn't detail the process of modifying template files, so the full extent of this capability is unclear.
*   **Website Defacement:** By selecting an arbitrary template, an attacker could deface the website during coming soon/maintenance mode.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Attack:** The attack can be launched remotely by any user, even those not logged into the WordPress site. The vulnerability is directly accessible through an AJAX endpoint that doesn't require authentication.
*   **Direct AJAX Call:** The attacker sends a request with the `templateId` parameter to the `wp_ajax_activate_template` action. The request includes the `nonce` parameter, which could be guessed by an attacker or retrieved from public pages of the target website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need a user account to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site's server.
*   **Knowledge of Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the AJAX endpoint `wp_ajax_activate_template`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was patched in version 1.1.0 of the plugin.
*   The provided code snippets show the vulnerable function and the AJAX action hooks that expose it to unauthenticated users.
*   The `check_ajax_referer` call within the `ucsm_activate_lite_template_lite` function is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized template activation, as the nonce is designed for preventing CSRF attacks and not for proper authorization.

In summary, this is a medium severity vulnerability that allows unauthorized users to modify a WordPress site's coming soon/maintenance page due to a missing authorization check in the template activation function.
