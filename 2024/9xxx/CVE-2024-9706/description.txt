The Ultimate Coming Soon & Maintenance plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ucsm_activate_lite_template_lite function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.9. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the template used for the coming soon / maintenance page.
