{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a stack-based buffer during the parsing of SID files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to lack of proper validation of input data length.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted malicious SID file or visiting a malicious web page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious SID file. The user needs to interact with the file by opening it or be tricked into visiting a malicious page.",
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability was fixed in a test version, which can be found at http://www.irfanview.info/test/iview64_test.zip"
