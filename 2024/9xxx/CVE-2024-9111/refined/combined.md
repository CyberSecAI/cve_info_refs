This is a great idea, but, sadly, I was never able to discover how to configure this plugin. The documentation is very brief and unclear.

The designer works great, but it does not help to have this feature when the customer design does not add to the order received. So how are you supposed to deliver what they have designed?

Allow me to start by saying the plug-in is good. I like it. However, it is still buggy. For example, when switching typefaces I have to make them bold for the changed typeface can be seen. I have a list of imprímenos or features that could be added. Hopefully the devs were thinking about this.
Allow us to have the edit button on specific tees. I have not seen any option where I can tell the plug-in where I want the button to customized my tees.
Allow the images, clip arts, shapes, and so on be downloaded as they were design on the tee. Also, allow us to download each image used separately (This is being implemented)
Allow us to tell the users that they can upload images unlimited for their designs. Meaning, let us give the client a limit of uploading images for their design or make this uploaded images be deleted after a few days. (I don’t know if it can be implemented. Hopefully the devs will figure something out)
Allow us to place a canvas on the tee where the design should be on while also letting us let the clients run wild with their designs.
These are the implementations and improvements I hope to see. Let’s make this plugging the best out there.

This plugin is so good. I am using it and truth be told, I am enjoying it. I recommend it to whoever needs a product designer. Kudos to the developers.
Also when I could not set it up very well, the support I got from the developer was fantastic. I highly recommend the plugin.

### Description

The Product Designer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.36 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the SVG file.
