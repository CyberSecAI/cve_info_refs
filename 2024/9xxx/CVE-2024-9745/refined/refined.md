- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of TIF files within Tungsten Automation Power PDF. Specifically, the software fails to properly validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a fixed-length, stack-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to complete control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the software processes a specially crafted TIF file. The target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious TIF file to be exploited.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious TIF file. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability, such as the user opening the malicious file or visiting a malicious webpage.
