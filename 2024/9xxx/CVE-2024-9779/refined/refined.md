  "CVE-2024-9779": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in Open Cluster Management (OCM) when a user has access to the worker nodes which contain the cluster-manager or klusterlet deployments. The cluster-manager deployment uses a service account with the same name \"cluster-manager\" which is bound to a ClusterRole also named \"cluster-manager\", which includes the permission to create Pod resources. If this deployment runs a pod on an attacker-controlled node, the attacker can obtain the cluster-manager's token and steal any service account token by creating and mounting the target service account to control the whole cluster.",
    "root_cause": "The cluster-manager and klusterlet deployments use service accounts with excessive permissions, allowing them to create pods. This enables an attacker with control over a worker node to escalate privileges.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Excessive permissions granted to the cluster-manager and klusterlet service accounts.",
      "Insecure configuration allows pod creation with the service account's token."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with control over a worker node can obtain the cluster-manager or klusterlet service account's token. They can then use this token to steal tokens of other service accounts, potentially leading to full cluster control.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Compromise of a worker node hosting the cluster-manager or klusterlet deployment",
        "Creating a pod on the compromised node using the cluster-manager or klusterlet service account"
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Access to a worker node hosting the vulnerable cluster-manager or klusterlet pod.",
        "Ability to create pods on the compromised node using the cluster-manager or klusterlet service account."
    ],
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because the cluster-manager and klusterlet service accounts have the permission to create Pod resources, which can be exploited to mount other service account tokens from within a pod running on an attacker-controlled node. The fix involves reducing the permissions of cluster-manager and klusterlet."
