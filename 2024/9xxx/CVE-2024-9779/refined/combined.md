| The Deployment named "cluster-manager" uses a ServiceAccount with the same name ("cluster-manager"). This ServiceAccount is bound to a ClusterRole also named "cluster-manager," which includes the permission to create Pod resources.  Therefore, if this Deployment runs a pod on an attacker-controlled node, the attacker can obtain the cluster-manager's token and steal any sa's token by creating and mounting target sa. And even control the whole cluster. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2317916#c0)  OSIDB Bzimport    2024-10-10 20:36:13 UTC  ``` The Deployment named "cluster-manager" uses a ServiceAccount with the same name ("cluster-manager"). This ServiceAccount is bound to a ClusterRole also named "cluster-manager," which includes the permission to create Pod resources.  Therefore, if this Deployment runs a pod on an attacker-controlled node, the attacker can obtain the cluster-manager's token and steal any sa's token by creating and mounting target sa and even control the whole cluster.   ``` |  |
