Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9427

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to unsanitized input in the query string within the Koji web interface. HTML tag characters are not properly escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code injected via a crafted URL can be reflected in the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session when they visit a malicious link. The injected javascript could have access to the Koji user's cookies and potentially other private data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious link with the injected script. They need no other special privileges or access to the Koji system. The victim needs to visit that crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**

- While existing XSS protections in the code prevent direct actions or changes in Koji from this vulnerability, it's still considered a serious issue.
- The fix involves escaping HTML tag characters in the query string.
- Fixed versions of Koji are 1.35.1, 1.34.3, and 1.33.2. Users of older versions are advised to upgrade.
