## What is Alabaster?

Alabaster is a visually (c)lean, responsive, configurable theme for the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) documentation system.
It requires Python 3.10 or newer and Sphinx 6.2 or newer.

It began as a third-party theme, and is still maintained separately, but as of
Sphinx 1.3, Alabaster is an install-time dependency of Sphinx and is selected
as the default theme.

Live examples of this theme can be seen on [this project's own website](https://alabaster.readthedocs.io/), [paramiko.org](https://www.paramiko.org),
[fabfile.org](https://www.fabfile.org) and [pyinvoke.org](https://www.pyinvoke.org).

For more documentation, please see <https://alabaster.readthedocs.io/>.

# CVE-2024-9427[¶](#cve-2024-9427 "Permalink to this heading")

New XSS attack on kojiweb

## Summary[¶](#summary "Permalink to this heading")

An unsanitized input allows for an XSS attack. Javascript code from a malicious
link could be reflected in the resulting web page. At present, we do not
believe that this can be used to submit an action or make a change in Koji due
to existing XSS protections in the code. Even so, this is a serious issue and
we recommend applying this update promptly.

## Bug fix[¶](#bug-fix "Permalink to this heading")

We are releasing updates for affected versions of Koji from within the
past year.
The following releases all contain the fix:

* 1.35.1
* 1.34.3
* 1.33.2

Anyone using a Koji version older than a year should update to a more
current version as soon as possible.

For users who have customized their Koji code, we recommend rebasing your work
onto the appropriate update release. Please see Koji
[issue #4204](https://pagure.io/koji/issue/4204) for the code details.

As with all changes to web code, you must restart httpd for the changes to
take effect.

## Links[¶](#links "Permalink to this heading")

Fixed versions can be found at our releases page:
