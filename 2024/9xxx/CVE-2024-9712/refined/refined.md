{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation of object existence before operations are performed on it during the parsing of SKP files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious SKP file or visiting a malicious page that triggers the vulnerable code path.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to open a malicious SKP file or visit a malicious page. No special privileges are required."
