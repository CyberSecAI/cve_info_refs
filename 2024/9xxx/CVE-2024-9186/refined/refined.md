- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `bwfan-track-id` parameter before using it in a SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated users can perform SQL injection attacks. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data, and potentially gaining control of the database server.
- **Attack vectors:** The `bwfan-track-id` parameter is vulnerable via two methods using a crafted URL.
    -  `$SITE_URL/index.php?rest_route=%2Fautonami-app%2Fv3%2Fcontacts%2F1%2Fengagements&mode=1&offset=0&limit=25&_locale=user&bwfan-track-action=111&bwfan-track-id=[SQL Injection Payload]&bwfan-track-action=open`
    - `$SITE_URL/?bwfan-track-id=[SQL Injection Payload]&bwfan-track-action=click`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can perform the attack via a crafted URL.
