Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Fortra's GoAnywhere MFT application that allows external access to resources located in certain admin root folders.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors due to improper access controls. Specifically, the application fails to restrict external access to resources within certain admin root folders.
- CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker could potentially gain access to files and resources located within the affected admin root folders, potentially exposing sensitive information. The impact is considered "Limited" as, by default, these folders don't typically contain sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability is accessible remotely (AV:N), meaning an attacker can exploit it over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low Privileges Required: The attacker needs low privileges (PR:L) to exploit this vulnerability.
- No User Interaction: No user interaction (UI:N) is needed for the exploit to occur.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in GoAnywhere MFT versions prior to 7.7.0.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N), indicating a medium severity.
- The issue was discovered on 17-Nov-2023.
- The vendor has released a fix by upgrading to version 7.7.0 or higher.
-  It is important to note that while the vulnerability allows access to resources in "certain admin root folders," these folders do not typically store any sensitive data by default.
