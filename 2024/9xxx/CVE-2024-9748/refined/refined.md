- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation of an object's existence before performing operations on it during the parsing of XPS files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-After-Free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through a malicious XPS file or by directing the user to a malicious webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to deliver a malicious XPS file to the target or trick the user into visiting a malicious page. User interaction is required.
