Multiple Vulnerabilities in GENESIS64TM and MC Works64

Release date: November 28, 2024
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation

Overview

Multiple malicious code execution vulnerabilities exist in GENESIS64TM and MC Works64. An attacker may be able to execute a
arbitrary code by storing a specially crafted DLL in a specific folder or tampering with a specially crafted DLL. This could lead to
disclose information in the affected products, tamper with, destroy or delete information in the affected products, or cause a denial of
service (DoS) condition on the preducts. (CVE-2024-8299、CVE-2024-8300、CVE-2024-9852).
For GENESIS64TM and MC Works64 versions prior to 10.97.3, they are unconditionally affected by CVE-2024-8299 and CVE-
2024-9852. For versions 10.97.3 and later, they are affected if the multi-agent notification feature is installed. Additionally, if these
products are installed in an unprotected folder other than the default installation folder, they are affected by CVE-2024-8300.
Affected versions of GENESIS64TM and MC Works64 are listed below. Please apply a security patch and take mitigations.

Description

The following three vulnerabilities exist in GENESIS64TM and MC Works64.

CVE-2024-8299  A malicious code execution vulnerability due to Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-4272) exists in the

Phone agant of the alarm multi-agent notification feature of GENESIS64TM and MC Works64. For
GENESIS64TM and MC Works64 versions prior to 10.97.3, this vulnerability is unconditionally affected. For
version 10.97.3 and later, they are affected if the multi-agent notification feature is installed.
CVE-2024-8300   A malicious code execution vulnerability due to Dead Code(CWE-5613) exists in the FA device communication

driver of GENESIS64TM

CVE-2024-9852   A malicious code execution vulnerability due to Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) exists in the

Phone agant of the alarm multi-agent notification feature on GENESIS64TM and MC Works64. For
GENESIS64TM and MC Works64 versions prior to 10.97.3, this vulnerability is unconditionally affected. For
version 10.97.3 and later, they are affected if the multi-agent notification feature is installed.

Impact

An attacker may be able to execute a malicious  code by storing a specially crafted DLL in a specific folder or tampering with a
specially crafted DLL. This could lead to disclose information in the affected products, tamper with, destroy or delete information in
the affected products, or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the products.

Mitigations / Workarounds

Mitsubishi Electric recommends that customers take the following mitigations to minimize the risk of exploiting these vulnerabilities.

All vulnerabilities

1)  Use PCs with the affected product installed in the LAN and block remote login from untrusted networks, hosts, and users.
2)  Prevent unauthorized access by using a firewall or virtual private network (VPN), etc., and allow remote login only to

trusted users when connecting a PC with the affected product installed to the Internet.

3)  Restrict physical access to the PC on which the affected product is installed and the network to which the PC is connected to

prevent unauthorized physical contact.

4)  Do not click on web links in emails from untrusted sources. Also, do not open attachments in untrusted emails.

CVE-2024-8299 and CVE-2024-9852

If you do not need to use the multi-agent notification function, please uninstall it.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

For CVE-2024-8299 and CVE-2024-9852, ICONICS Product Suite versions 10.97.3 and later have mitigations for these vulnerabilities. If planning to use the AlarmWorX64 MMX, use the 10.97.3 version and follow the guidelines provided in the ICONICS Whitepaper on Security Vulnerabilities, November 2024 edition.

For CVE-2024-8300, security patches corresponding to each version are as follows:

* If you are using GENESIS64TM version 10.97.2, use version 10.97.2 Critical Fixes Rollup 3.
* If you are using GENESIS64TM version 10.97.3 series, use version 10.97.3 Critical Fixes Rollup 1.

ICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric recommend updating the ICONICS Suite with the latest security patches as they become available. [ICONICS Suite security patches may be found here](https://partners.iconics.com/Home.aspx) (login required).

ICONICS and Mitsubishi Electric is releasing security updates as critical fixes/rollup releases. Refer to the ICONICS Whitepaper on security vulnerabilities, the most recent version of which can be [found here](https://iconics.com/About/Security/CERT) and to the [Mitsubishi Electric security advisory](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2024-010_en.pdf) for information on the availability of the security updates. MC Works64 users should take the mitigations described in the [Mitsubishi Electric security advisory](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2024-010_en.pdf), since there are no plans to release a fix version.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for [proactive defense of ICS assets](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity_Best_Practices_for_Industrial_Control_Systems.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/industrial-control-systems) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open attachments in unsolicited email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
