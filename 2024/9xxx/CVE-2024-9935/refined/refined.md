Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9935

**Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Download

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in the `rtw_pgaepb_dwnld_pdf()` function of the "PDF Generator Addon for Elementor Page Builder" plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or validate the file path provided in the `rtw_pdf_file` GET parameter. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path, potentially accessing files outside the intended directory (RTW\_PDF\_DIR).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to read the content of arbitrary files on the server. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, such as configuration files, database credentials, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the WordPress site with a specially crafted `rtw_pdf_file` parameter in the URL.
*   The vulnerable code is located within the `rtw_pgaepb_dwnld_pdf()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated:** No prior authentication or user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be located anywhere with network access to the vulnerable website.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable code is within the function  `rtw_pgaepb_dwnld_pdf()` which uses `$_GET['rtw_pdf_file']` without proper sanitization and validation which leads to path traversal.
*   The code attempts to use `realpath()` to resolve the path and then uses `strpos()` to ensure the path is within the intended directory. However, the check is flawed and can be bypassed by path traversal techniques like `../`
*   The `wp_check_filetype()` check is performed after the path traversal can occur, so it doesn't prevent the exploit.
*   The vulnerable code uses `readfile()` to send the file content.
*  The plugin versions <= 2.0.0 are vulnerable. Version 2.0.1 and above contain the fix.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided code snippet includes a function `rtw_pgaepb_convert_to_pdf`, which is used to generate PDF files. It has a nonce check, and appears to be protected from unauthenticated access. It uses the included mpdf library.
*   The vulnerability is present in the public-facing part of the plugin.
