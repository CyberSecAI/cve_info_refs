- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing PSD files, prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious PSD file or a malicious page that triggers the parsing of a malicious PSD file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to get the user to open a malicious file or visit a malicious page. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.
