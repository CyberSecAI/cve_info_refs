Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9682:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
The provided content directly references "CVE-2024-9682" and describes a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin, aligning with the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** on user-supplied attributes within the plugin's Form Builder widget. This allows malicious code to be injected and stored.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied data used in the Form Builder widget. The injected JavaScript payload is stored in the database and executed when the page is accessed.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages. This code will then execute in the browsers of users who access the compromised pages.
*   **Compromise of User Accounts:**  The impact can range from stealing sensitive data to redirecting users to malicious websites, and potentially to complete account takeover.
*   **Website Defacement:**  Attackers could potentially alter the visual appearance and behavior of pages where the malicious script is embedded.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Form Builder Widget:** The primary attack vector is through the Form Builder widget within the Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin.
*   **User-Supplied Attributes:** Attackers inject malicious scripts by manipulating attributes of form elements within the plugin's widget, likely using a crafted form submission.
*   **Stored XSS**: The injection occurs through the submission of a specifically crafted input that gets stored in the database.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** Attackers need to be authenticated to the WordPress admin panel with at least "contributor" level privileges.
*   **Plugin Access:** The attacker has to have access to modify pages that use the vulnerable "Form Builder" widget.
