- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer during PDF file parsing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to the victim or lure them to a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability. User interaction is required.
