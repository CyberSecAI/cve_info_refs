- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of SKP files within Trimble SketchUp Viewer. Specifically, there is a lack of validation for the existence of an object before performing operations on it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-After-Free vulnerability due to the lack of object existence validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running SketchUp Viewer.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious SKP files or malicious web pages that trigger the parsing of a crafted SKP file. User interaction is required to open the malicious file or visit the malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious SKP file or convince the target to visit a malicious web page.
