Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing JP2 files. This leads to an out-of-bounds read.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability. Improper validation of user-supplied data.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information. It can also be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

Attack vectors: The attacker needs to provide a malicious JP2 file, which the target must open or visit a malicious page that triggers the parsing of the crafted file.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious file or lure the target to a webpage that triggers the parsing. User interaction is required.
