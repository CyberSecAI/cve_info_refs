Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9657:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content, especially from the Wordfence report and the Trac changeset, directly relates to CVE-2024-9657. The Wordfence report specifically mentions the CVE ID and describes a DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Element Pack Elementor Addons plugin, which aligns with the content changes observed in the Trac logs, particularly related to `ep-tooltip.js`, `ep-reading-timer.js`, `ep-logo-grid.js`, and `ep-image-stack.js`.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause of the vulnerability is insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the plugin. This means that user-provided input (specifically, the `tooltip` parameter) is not properly checked and cleaned before being used in the web page generation.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the presence of a DOM-Based Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. This is due to the improper handling of user-controlled data within the plugin, allowing for injection of malicious code that gets stored and then executed in the user's browser.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page. This can lead to a variety of impacts such as:

    *   **Malicious redirects:** Redirecting users to phishing sites or sites hosting malware.
    *   **Data theft:** Stealing sensitive information like session cookies or login credentials.
    *   **Website defacement:** Altering the appearance of the website or injecting malicious content.
    *   **Arbitrary actions:** Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code through the `tooltip` parameter of affected widgets. This injected code is then stored within the database and executed when the page with the affected widget is loaded in a user's browser.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

    *   **Authenticated access:** The attacker requires at least Contributor-level access to the WordPress site.
    *   **Ability to manipulate content:**  The attacker needs to have the ability to modify content that uses the affected widgets to inject the malicious payload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Affected widgets:** The Wordfence report highlights the affected parameters, stating that the vulnerability is within the 'tooltip' parameter. The Trac changeset indicates that `ep-tooltip.js`, `ep-reading-timer.js`, `ep-logo-grid.js`, and `ep-image-stack.js` are affected.
*   **Patch Information:** The vulnerability is patched in version 5.10.3 of the plugin, which includes changes to sanitization and output escaping functions, as noted in the `ep-scripts.js` and `ep-cookie-consent.js` changes.
*  **Affected Parameter**: The Wordfence report specifies that the vulnerability is triggered via the tooltip parameter in the plugin.
*   **Scope Beyond CVE:**  The provided data also show changes to multiple files like `bdt-dual-button.css`, `ep-custom-gallery.css`, `icon-mobile-menu.php`, `ep-helper.css` and various other assets and module files. While these do not directly related to the XSS vulnerability, they may be part of the overall update to version 5.10.3 and potentially relate to other security fixes not mentioned in this specific CVE.

In summary, CVE-2024-9657 identifies a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Element Pack Elementor Addons plugin, caused by insufficient sanitization. This allows attackers with contributor access or higher to inject malicious code via tooltip parameters, leading to various malicious activities. The vulnerability is resolved in plugin version 5.10.3.
