## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# RSS Feed Widget < 3.0.0 - Contributor+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not validate and escape some of its shortcode attributes before outputting them back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. As admin, go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=rfw\_options&t=4 and add any numeric values for the inputs
2. As a contributor, add the shortcode: `[rfw-youtube-videos number="20" height="300px" width="32%" bgcolor="black" fullscreen="false" margin='1px 1px 1px 1px" onmouseover="alert(1);"']`
3. Publish the post and mouseover the YouTube box to see the XSS
