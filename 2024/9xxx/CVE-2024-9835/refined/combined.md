## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# RSS Feed Widget < 3.0.1 - Reflected XSS

### Description

The plugin does not escape the $\_SERVER['REQUEST\_URI'] parameter before outputting it back in an attribute, which could lead to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in old web browsers

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin open the following URL using a web browser which does not encode characters:
`https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=rfw\_options&t=0&cows="><script>alert(999)</script> `
