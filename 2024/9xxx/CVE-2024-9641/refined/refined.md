- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The LuckyWP Table of Contents plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings. Specifically, the "By Text" textarea within the plugin's settings page is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings, which is then executed when other users access the affected settings page. This can lead to arbitrary actions, session hijacking, or other malicious activity within the context of the user's session. The impact is rated as low, likely due to the requirement for high privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the "By Text" textarea within the plugin's settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges on the WordPress site.
