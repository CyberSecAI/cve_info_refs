- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PNG files leads to a read past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure. An attacker can potentially leverage this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** User interaction is required, either by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file containing a crafted PNG.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the user with a malicious file or convince the user to visit a malicious page.
