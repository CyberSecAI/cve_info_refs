{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing TGA files, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a specially crafted TGA file. The target user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page to trigger the exploit.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious TGA file. The target must then open the file using Tungsten Automation Power PDF."
