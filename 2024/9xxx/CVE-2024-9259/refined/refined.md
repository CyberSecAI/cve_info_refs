{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing SID files, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Out-of-bounds write",
    "Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing a crafted SID file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious SID file and lure the victim into opening it (either directly or via a malicious webpage). User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability."
