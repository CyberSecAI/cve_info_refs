### CVE-2024-9503

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin lacks capability checks on several functions that modify plugin settings, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Access Control: Missing capability checks in the functions `wploti_add_whitelisted_roles_option`, `wploti_remove_whitelisted_roles_option`, `wploti_add_whitelisted_users_option`, `wploti_remove_whitelisted_users_option`, and `wploti_uploaded_animation_save_option`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An authenticated attacker with subscriber-level access or higher can modify plugin settings. This could potentially allow them to disable maintenance mode, add users who bypass the maintenance mode, or change the animation displayed.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: By sending a crafted POST request to the vulnerable functions via AJAX.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber-level access.
- The attacker does not require any specific capabilities apart from standard WordPress user privileges.
