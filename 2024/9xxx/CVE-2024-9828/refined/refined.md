- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Taskbuilder plugin does not sanitize user input provided via the `load_orders` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLI).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with administrator privileges can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could lead to data exfiltration, modification or deletion of data, or potential complete compromise of the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `wppm_set_category_order`, and the `load_orders` parameter containing malicious SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
