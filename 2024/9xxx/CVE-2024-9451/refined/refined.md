Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9451:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the 'height' and 'width' parameters within the `Embed PDF Viewer` WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape the 'height' and 'width' attributes when rendering the iframe, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored in the database and executed when a user visits a page containing the embedded PDF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
-   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This can lead to various malicious actions including:
    -   Session hijacking
    -   Defacement of the website
    -   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    -   Data theft
    -   Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Plugin Block Parameters:** The vulnerable parameters ('height' and 'width') are passed as attributes when rendering the PDF embed block.
-   **Stored XSS:** Malicious scripts are injected by modifying the height and width parameters in the block attributes. The injected script is then stored and executed when a user views the affected page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have Contributor-level access or higher to a WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin. This allows them to create or modify posts and pages, where they can inject the malicious code.
-   **Access to Edit Content:** Attackers must have the ability to add or modify content through the WordPress editor where they can add or manipulate the PDF embed block and inject the malicious scripts.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability is present in versions of the `Embed PDF Viewer` plugin up to and including 2.4.4.
-   The vulnerability was patched in version 2.4.5 by implementing proper sanitization using `esc_attr()`.
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in the commit [3164573](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3164573/) where the attributes `height` and `width` were escaped using `esc_attr()` during the iframe creation.
- The function `dynamic_render_callback` located in `embed-pdf-viewer.php` was vulnerable on line 144, before the fix.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `dynamic_render_callback` function specifically when generating the iframe code,  where the height and width attributes were not being properly escaped.
