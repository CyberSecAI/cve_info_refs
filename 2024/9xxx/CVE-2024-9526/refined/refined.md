The provided content is related to CVE-2024-9526. It references a pull request that introduced a fix for a vulnerability related to raw HTML parsing in the markdown-to-jsx component.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The markdown-to-jsx component was parsing raw HTML, which could lead to potential security issues.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability was the lack of sanitization of the rendered HTML, potentially allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if malicious code was included in the markdown.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If the vulnerability was exploited, an attacker could inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the rendered markdown, leading to potential XSS attacks, which could result in the theft of user cookies, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions within the context of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious markdown text containing raw HTML elements with malicious JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to influence or control the markdown input being rendered by the vulnerable component.
