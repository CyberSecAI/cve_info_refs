Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9774

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `python-sql` library performs insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection:  Lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into queries, potentially leading to unauthorized database access or modification.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- SQL injection could allow attackers to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Potentially gain control over the underlying database server in severe cases.

**Attack vectors:**
- User-supplied input that's used to construct SQL queries using the `python-sql` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide input that influences SQL queries constructed by the application using the vulnerable `python-sql` library.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was identified by CÃ©dric Krier.
- The issue has been fixed in version `1.2.1-1+deb11u1` for Debian 11 bullseye.
- The Tryton project is also impacted and has issued a security release.
