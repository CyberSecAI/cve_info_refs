- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically the "Alt Text" field for images in popups.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be stored in the database and executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected pages or admin panel. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to have administrator or a high-privilege account on the WordPress site to access and change the plugin settings. The malicious payload is injected through the "Alt Text" field of an image in a popup.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have admin-level access or another high-privileged user role. The attacker needs to access the plugin settings through the WordPress dashboard.
