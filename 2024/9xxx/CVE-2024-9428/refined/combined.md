## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Popup Builder < 4.3.5 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a new Image PopUp.
2. You should add new image and change "Alt Text" field of new Image to: 123"onload=alert(11251)//
3. Save Settings.

### Affects Plugins
