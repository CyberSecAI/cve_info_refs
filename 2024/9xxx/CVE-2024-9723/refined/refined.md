- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation of an object's existence before performing operations on it during the parsing of SKP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-After-Free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious SKP file or a malicious web page containing the exploit. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability by opening the malicious SKP file or visiting the malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious SKP file or create a malicious webpage that the victim would interact with.
