**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin's Google Maps widget. Specifically, user-provided data for the location title is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary web scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious scripts are stored in the database and executed when a user accesses a page containing the vulnerable Google Maps widget.
- **DOM-Based XSS:** The injected script manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) on the client-side.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to:
- Data theft (cookies, session data)
- Redirecting users to malicious websites
- Defacement of the website
- Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
An authenticated attacker with Contributor-level access or higher can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Location Title" field of the Google Maps widget through the WordPress admin panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a WordPress account with Contributor-level access or higher.
- The attacker must be able to edit pages or posts that use the vulnerable Google Maps widget.
