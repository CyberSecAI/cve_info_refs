- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A null pointer dereference occurs in PAN-OS software when a decryption policy is enabled. This happens when specific traffic is processed through the data plane.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference (CWE-476).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can crash PAN-OS, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Repeated attempts to trigger this will cause PAN-OS to enter maintenance mode.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted network traffic through the data plane.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected firewall. No authentication is required. The attacker does not need any special privileges.
