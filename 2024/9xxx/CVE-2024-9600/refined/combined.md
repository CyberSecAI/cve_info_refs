## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Ditty < 3.1.47 - Author+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as author to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a new post with the following title and publish it: 123" autofocus onfocus=alert(`XSS`)//
2. Create/edit a Ditty, add "WP Posts Feed (Lite)" block and save
3. The XSS will be triggered upon adding the Block, as well as any time a user will edit/access the Ditty (like in page where it's embed)

### Affects Plugins
