A vulnerability exists in NSD570 login panel that does not restrict excessive authentication attempts. If exploited, this could
cause account takeover and unauthorized access to the system
when an attacker conducts brute-force attacks against the
equipment login. Note that the system supports only one concurrent session and implements a delay of more than a second
between failed login attempts making it difficult to automate the
attacks.
