### Summary:
The provided content describes an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Social Share, Social Login and Social Comments Plugin â€“ Super Socializer plugin for WordPress, affecting versions up to and including 7.13.68.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from insufficient verification of user information returned by social login tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Authentication:** The plugin fails to properly validate the user identity during social login, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can log in as any existing user on the WordPress site by exploiting the flawed social login mechanism.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** This vulnerability enables attackers to gain access to user accounts without proper credentials.
*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** While not an inherent aspect of this vulnerability, if administrator accounts have social login explicitly enabled, they are also vulnerable to this attack, potentially leading to complete site compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Social Login:** The vulnerability is exploited through the social login functionality of the plugin.
*   **Network:** The attacker can be remote (i.e. the attack vector is network based).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the WordPress site.
*   **Email Access:** The attacker needs access to the email of the target user, but the user needs to have no existing account using social login with the service used by the attacker.
*   **Social Login:** The attacker must leverage a social login service supported by the plugin.
*   **Network Access:** Attacker requires network access to send requests.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was partially patched in version 7.13.68. A full fix is provided in version 7.14, and subsequent updates.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 8.1 (High), with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   The plugin now checks if Vkontakte account is verified before saving the email and Spotify account email is no longer fetched.
*   The issue has been fixed in versions 7.13.68 and 7.14
