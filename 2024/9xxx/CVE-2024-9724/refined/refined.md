- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists within the parsing of SKP files due to a lack of validation of object existence before performing operations on the object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-After-Free vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires user interaction, either by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious SKP file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious SKP file to the victim. The victim needs to interact with the malicious file or page.
