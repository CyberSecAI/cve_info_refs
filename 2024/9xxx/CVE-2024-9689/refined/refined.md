- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when deleting posts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF checks on the post deletion functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to delete arbitrary posts through a crafted request.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious link containing a `task=delete` and the `postid` parameter, which, when accessed by a logged-in administrator, triggers the post deletion without their direct consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator into clicking the malicious link or visiting a page where the link is embedded.
