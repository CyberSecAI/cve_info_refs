{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of JP2 files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write due to insufficient input validation when parsing JP2 files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious JP2 file or visiting a malicious page that triggers the vulnerable code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the user interact with a malicious JP2 file or visit a malicious page. No special privileges are needed on the target system, but user interaction is required."
