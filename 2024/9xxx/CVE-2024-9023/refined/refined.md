  - Data theft
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- The `wwa_login_form` shortcode is the primary attack vector.
- Malicious scripts are injected via user-supplied attributes within the shortcode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be authenticated users with at least contributor-level access. This means that they can create or modify posts/pages where shortcodes can be embedded.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of the WP-WebAuthn plugin up to and including 1.3.3.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.4.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Peter Thaleikis.
- The Wordfence Intelligence vulnerability database provides more details on this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on September 27, 2024.

In summary, this vulnerability allows authenticated users (Contributor or higher) to inject malicious scripts through the plugin's shortcode, posing a significant security risk to WordPress sites using affected versions of the plugin.
