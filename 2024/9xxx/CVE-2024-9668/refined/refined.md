Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin's Countdown widget. Specifically, user-supplied attributes are not properly handled, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to neutralize user-provided input when rendering the Countdown widget, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of users viewing pages containing the vulnerable Countdown widget. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Website defacement
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Other unauthorized actions

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Plugin's Countdown Widget:** The vulnerability is specifically located within the Countdown widget of the Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin.
*   **User-Supplied Attributes:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts via user-supplied attributes within the Countdown widget settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least contributor-level access to WordPress.
*   **Access to Widget Settings:** The attacker needs the ability to modify and save settings related to the Countdown widget in WordPress.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin up to and including 1.7.1001.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.7.1002.
*   The provided code snippet `wpr-countdown.php` shows the implementation of the countdown widget, but does not directly highlight the vulnerability.
