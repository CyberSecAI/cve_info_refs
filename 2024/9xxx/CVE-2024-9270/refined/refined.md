Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9270

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when handling SVG file uploads within the Lenxel Core plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize SVG file uploads, allowing malicious scripts embedded within the SVG to be stored on the server. These scripts then execute when the SVG file is accessed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that display the uploaded SVG file.
*   This could allow attackers to perform various malicious actions such as:
    *   Stealing session cookies.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through uploading a specially crafted malicious SVG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have at least Author-level access to the WordPress site. This level of access allows the attacker to upload media files, including potentially malicious SVG files.
*   **Upload Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to upload files, specifically SVG files through the WordPress media uploader.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Lenxel Core plugin up to and including 1.2.3.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.5.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Francesco Carlucci.
