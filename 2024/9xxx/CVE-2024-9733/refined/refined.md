- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PDF files, which can lead to a write past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious PDF file. The user must open the malicious PDF file, making user interaction required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to deliver a crafted PDF to the victim.
