{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of validating the existence of an object before performing operations on it during the parsing of SKP files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves user interaction, requiring the target to either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious SKP file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious SKP file or a malicious webpage that triggers the vulnerability when opened by the user."
