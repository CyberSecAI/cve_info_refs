- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing capability check during file uploads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload vulnerability, specifically allowing the upload of dangerous file types like EXE and SVG.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  Arbitrary web scripts can be injected into pages via SVG files, which execute when a user accesses the SVG file.
    - Arbitrary EXE files can be uploaded, potentially leading to remote code execution if the attacker can execute the file or trick a user into running it.
- **Attack vectors**: Authenticated attackers with Author-level access or higher can upload malicious files through the plugin's upload functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have at least Author-level access to the WordPress site.
