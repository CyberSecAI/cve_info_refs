## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Pods < 3.2.7.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Create a new Users pod.
2. Add new field to this pod.
3. Change "Label" to` alert(1)` and "Field type" to Heading.
4. In Heading Options change "Heading HTML tag" field to `script` and save settings.
5. View any user profile to see the XSS.
