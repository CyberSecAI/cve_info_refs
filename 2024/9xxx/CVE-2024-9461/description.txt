The Total Upkeep â€“ WordPress Backup Plugin plus Restore & Migrate by BoldGrid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.16.6 via the cron_interval parameter. This is due to missing input validation and sanitization. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to execute code on the server.
