- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation of object existence before performing operations on it during the parsing of SKP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-After-Free vulnerability in SKP file parsing.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious SKP file or visiting a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious SKP file or lure the victim to a malicious page. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.
