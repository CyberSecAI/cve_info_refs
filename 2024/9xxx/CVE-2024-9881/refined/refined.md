{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "High privilege users, such as admins, can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected page. This can lead to various malicious activities such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, and more.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to have admin or other high privilege access to the WordPress admin panel. The XSS payload is injected through the plugin's settings page, specifically within the 'Instruction' field of the offline payment settings. The XSS is triggered on the frontend checkout page when a user views the checkout.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have a high-privilege user account, such as an administrator, on the target WordPress site."
