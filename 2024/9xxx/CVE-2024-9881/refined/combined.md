## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# LearnPress < 4.2.7.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Add a new course
2. Go to https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=learn-press-settings&tab=payments&section=offline-payment
3. Enable offline payment and in the "Instruction" add the payload: "><script>alert(5555)</script>
4. On the frontend, select the "Buy Now" option for the course and see the XSS on the checkout page
