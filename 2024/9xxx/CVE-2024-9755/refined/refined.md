```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing JP2 files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Out-of-bounds read"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack requires user interaction, where the target must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing a crafted JP2 file.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious JP2 file, either through a webpage or by convincing the user to open it. No special privileges are required by the attacker."
