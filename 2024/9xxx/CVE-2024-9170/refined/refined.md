Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9170:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content directly relates to **CVE-2024-9170**, as evidenced by the title from `www.wordfence.com`, which states: "Booster for WooCommerce <= 7.2.3 - Authenticated (ShopManager+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via wcj\_product\_meta Shortcode".
*   The Wordfence description also mentions that the vulnerability is due to "insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes" of the `wcj_product_meta` shortcode.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in the **insufficient input sanitization and output escaping** of user-supplied attributes within the `wcj_product_meta` shortcode in the Booster for WooCommerce plugin. This allows for injection of malicious code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape user-supplied input, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability. This means malicious scripts can be stored within the plugin's settings or database and executed later.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Web Script Execution:** Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code into web pages. This can lead to various attacks, including:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or injecting malware.
    *   **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms or other phishing scams.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the website's content and appearance.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **`wcj_product_meta` Shortcode:** The vulnerability is specifically triggered by the use of the `wcj_product_meta` shortcode with malicious attributes.
*   **Stored XSS:** The malicious payload is stored within the WordPress database or the plugin settings, which means it will execute whenever the injected page is loaded.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have at least `ShopManager` level access (or higher) to WordPress.
*   **Ability to Create/Edit Content:** The attacker must be able to create or modify content where the shortcode is used, such as product descriptions or pages.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of the Booster for WooCommerce plugin up to and including 7.2.3.
*   The fix is available in version 7.2.4.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Francesco Carlucci.
*   The file `includes/shortcodes/class-wcj-products-shortcodes.php` has the vulnerable code
*   The fix includes sanitizing the `meta_key` value before its passed to `get_post_meta()`.
*   The fix also includes sanitizing data before using it in `add_query_arg` and `remove_query_arg` functions
