- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `wpaft_option_page` function of the Category and Taxonomy Meta Fields plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers can add and delete taxonomy meta.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick a site administrator into performing an action, such as clicking on a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and induce a logged-in administrator to trigger it. This can be achieved via social engineering, malicious links, or other means.
