Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9705:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check within the `ucsm_update_template_name_lite` function in the Ultimate Coming Soon & Maintenance WordPress plugin. This function allows users to update the name of templates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The core issue is the absence of a proper capability check before allowing users to execute the `ucsm_update_template_name_lite` function. This means that any authenticated user, including those with minimal privileges like "Subscriber," can potentially alter template names.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (Indirect):** While not a direct IDOR, the lack of authorization control over template names which are stored by id can indirectly be used to perform unauthorized actions, because the template name is tied to the template id.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Modification:** Attackers can change the names of templates within the plugin, which, while not a high impact on it's own, can be used for malicious purposes such as creating confusion and potentially aiding in further exploitation.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** While the ability to only rename templates seems like a low impact vulnerability, this access could allow for targeted attacks, for example against administrator accounts.
- **Loss of Functionality/Defacement:** In some edge cases, it's possible this could lead to loss of functionality or defacement of the coming soon page through manipulating the wrong template.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending a crafted HTTP request to the WordPress site.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the WordPress site.
- **Privilege:** The attacker only needs "Subscriber" level access or higher to exploit the vulnerability.

- The fix is implemented in version 1.1.0.
