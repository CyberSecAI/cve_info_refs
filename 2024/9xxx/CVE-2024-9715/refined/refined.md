Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2024-9715:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free condition within the parsing of SKP files in Trimble SketchUp Viewer. Specifically, the issue arises from a lack of validation of an object's existence before performing operations on it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability: the program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential for exploitation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process, allowing them to gain control over the affected system. This includes the ability to read, write, and modify files, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a malicious SKP file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- User interaction is required. The target user must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious SKP file. The attacker needs to craft a malicious SKP file that exploits the use-after-free vulnerability.
