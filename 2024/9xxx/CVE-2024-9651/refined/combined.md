## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Contact Form Plugin by Fluent Forms < 5.2.1 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup).

### Proof of Concept

1. Switch to Fluent Forms
2. Select Forms
3. Click Add New Form and select Choose a Template. in the IT category, select Graphic Designer Contact.
4. In the editing form, go to Your Email and select the Custom Error Message field in it. Place the payload in this field
5. The payload is as follows: `"><script></script><img src=x onerror=alert(/testXSS/)>`
6. After the XSS payload is installed, click on Save Form.
7. XSS will be displayed when using the shortcode and clicking on the submit button

# CVE-2024-9651 – Fluent Forms – Stored XSS to Backdoor Creation – POC

You are here: [Home](https://research.cleantalk.org/) » CVE-2024-9651 – Fluent Forms – Stored XSS to Backdoor Creation – POC

**Fluent Forms**, a widely used WordPress plugin that has been installed more than **500,000** times, is known for its advanced and lightweight contact form builder. With features such as drag-and-drop customization, conditional logic, and anti-spam, it has become a staple for both businesses and developers. However, such popularity also makes it an object for exploitation. The vulnerability associated with the persistence of **cross-site scripting (XSS) CVE-2024-9651** in older versions of **Fluent Forms** pages poses a significant risk, potentially allowing attackers to introduce backdoors and compromise entire websites.

**Version 5.2.5 of Fluent Forms has received a plugin Security Certificate (PSC)**, which guarantees users that this version is verified as secure.

## **Timeline**

| September 9, 2024 | Plugin testing and vulnerability detection in the ****Fluent Forms**** have been completed |
| --- | --- |
| September 9, 2024 | I contacted the author of the plugin and provided a vulnerability PoC with a description and recommendations for fixing |
| November 19, 2024 | Registered **CVE-2024-9651** |

## **Discovery of the Vulnerability**

The **stored XSS vulnerability in Fluent Forms 5.2.1** was discovered during a routine security review. The issue lies in the “**Custom Error Message**” field under form configurations. This field allows administrators to set custom error messages for user inputs. However, inadequate sanitization of this field creates an opening for attackers to inject malicious scripts.

When saved and executed, XSS payload triggers a malicious script whenever the form is rendered or interacted with. Such exploits can lead to severe consequences, including data theft, unauthorized access, and the installation of backdoors.

## **Understanding of XSS attack’s**

**Stored XSS** occurs when a malicious script is injected into an application and stored on the server. This script is then served to other users, often executing in their browsers as part of the legitimate content. In WordPress, stored XSS is particularly dangerous because plugins like Fluent Forms often have administrative privileges, amplifying the potential damage.

## **Exploiting the ********XSS******** Vulnerability**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker only needs access to the form settings. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

> **POC**:
>
> 1. **Access Fluent Forms:** Navigate to the plugin’s settings in the WordPress dashboard.
> 2. **Create a New Form:** Click “Add New Form” and select a template, such as “Graphic Designer Contact.”
> 3. **Inject the Payload:** Edit the “Your Email” field and place the malicious payload in the “Custom Error Message” field.
> 4. **Save the Form:** Save the form settings.
> 5. **Trigger the Exploit:** Use the shortcode to embed the form on a page or post. When a user interacts with the form, the stored XSS payload is executed.
>
> ```
> PoC Payload: "><script></script><img src=x onerror=alert(/testXSS/)>
> ```
>
> \_\_\_\_

This simplicity underscores the danger of stored XSS vulnerabilities, particularly in widely used plugins like Fluent Forms.

## ****Recommendations for Improved Security****

**CVE-2024-9651** serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance in plugin development and usage. While Fluent Forms is a powerful and versatile tool, its widespread adoption makes it a prime target for exploitation.

Thankfully, **version 5.2.5** addresses this vulnerability and provides users with peace of mind through its **PSC certification**. By staying updated and following best practices, WordPress administrators can continue leveraging Fluent Forms’ features without compromising security. Let this be a call to action for all developers and users to prioritize security in every aspect of their digital presence.
