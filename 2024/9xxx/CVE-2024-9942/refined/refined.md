Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2024-9942

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of file type validation within the `MJ_gmgt_user_avatar_image_upload()` function in the WPGYM - WordPress Gym Management System plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin allows the upload of arbitrary files without proper validation. This is a classic vulnerability that can lead to severe consequences.
