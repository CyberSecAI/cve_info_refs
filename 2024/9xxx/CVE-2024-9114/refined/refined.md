- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the parsing of GIF files within FastStone Image Viewer, specifically due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write. The lack of proper validation allows for a write operation that goes beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve remote code execution in the context of the current process, allowing them to run arbitrary code on the target system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires user interaction. The target must either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious GIF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious GIF file that exploits the vulnerability. They can then distribute this file through a web page or other means, requiring the victim to interact with it.
