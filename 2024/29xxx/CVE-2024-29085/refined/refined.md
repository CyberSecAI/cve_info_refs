Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2024-29085:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper access control in some BigDL software maintained by Intel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary vulnerability is related to improper access control. This means that the software does not correctly restrict access to certain functionalities or resources based on user roles or privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Escalation of Privilege: An authenticated user could potentially elevate their access level to perform actions they are not authorized for.
*   The document states that this vulnerability may enable an authenticated user to potentially escalate privileges via adjacent access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Adjacent access is required, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network or have some form of local access.
*   The attacker must be an authenticated user of the BigDL software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have valid credentials to log into the affected BigDL software.
*   The attacker must have adjacent access (same network or local) to the affected system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in BigDL software versions prior to 2.5.0.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Medium".
*   The vulnerability was reported by houjingyi.
*   Intel recommends updating to version 2.5.0 or later to mitigate the issue.
