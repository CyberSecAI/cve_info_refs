  "CVE-2024-29646": {
    "Description": "Buffer Overflow vulnerability in radarorg radare2 v.5.8.8 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code via the name, type, or group fields.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the usage of `scanf` with `%s` format specifiers without proper bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow when parsing input strings. This issue was exacerbated by inconsistent handling of string sizes within the parsing logic.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of `scanf` with unbounded `%s` format specifier",
      "Lack of proper bounds checking when parsing input strings",
      "Inconsistent handling of string sizes"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by providing a maliciously crafted input string that overflows the buffer, leading to control-flow hijacking.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Manipulating input strings, especially the 'name', 'type', or 'group' fields, to cause buffer overflows during parsing.",
        "Specifically targeting the parsing logic related to register profiles or debug information."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to influence the input strings provided to the vulnerable `scanf` calls, which may be achieved through crafting specific files or inputs that will be parsed by the radare2 program.",
      "Attacker needs to be able to supply malicious input to a radare2 program using the vulnerable code."
